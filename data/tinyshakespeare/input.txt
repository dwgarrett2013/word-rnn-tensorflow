In this refulgent summer, it has been a luxury to draw the breath of life. The grass grows, the buds burst, the meadow is spotted with fire and gold in the tint of flowers. The air is full of birds, and sweet with the breath of the pine, the balm-of-Gilead, and the new hay. Night brings no gloom to the heart with its welcome shade. Through the transparent darkness the stars pour their almost spiritual rays. Man under them seems a young child, and his huge globe a toy. The cool night bathes the world as with a river, and prepares his eyes again for the crimson dawn. The mystery of nature was never displayed more happily. The corn and the wine have been freely dealt to all creatures, and the never-broken silence with which the old bounty goes forward, has not yielded yet one word of explanation. One is constrained to respect the perfection of this world, in which our senses converse. How wide; how rich; what invitation from every property it gives to every faculty of man! In its fruitful soils; in its navigable sea; in its mountains of metal and stone; in its forests of all woods; in its animals; in its chemical ingredients; in the powers and path of light, heat, attraction, and life, it is well worth the pith and heart of great men to subdue and enjoy it. The planters, the mechanics, the inventors, the astronomers, the builders of cities, and the captains, history delights to honor.

But when the mind opens, and reveals the laws which traverse the universe, and make things what they are, then shrinks the great world at once into a mere illustration and fable of this mind. What am I? and What is? asks the human spirit with a curiosity new-kindled, but never to be quenched. Behold these outrunning laws, which our imperfect apprehension can see tend this way and that, but not come full circle. Behold these infinite relations, so like, so unlike; many, yet one. I would study, I would know, I would admire forever. These works of thought have been the entertainments of the human spirit in all ages.

A more secret, sweet, and overpowering beauty appears to man when his heart and mind open to the sentiment of virtue. Then he is instructed in what is above him. He learns that his being is without bound; that, to the good, to the perfect, he is born, low as he now lies in evil and weakness. That which he venerates is still his own, though he has not realized it yet. He ought. He knows the sense of that grand word, though his analysis fails entirely to render account of it. When in innocency, or when by intellectual perception, he attains to say, — `I love the Right; Truth is beautiful within and without, forevermore. Virtue, I am thine: save me: use me: thee will I serve, day and night, in great, in small, that I may be not virtuous, but virtue;' — then is the end of the creation answered, and God is well pleased.

The sentiment of virtue is a reverence and delight in the presence of certain divine laws. It perceives that this homely game of life we play, covers, under what seem foolish details, principles that astonish. The child amidst his baubles, is learning the action of light, motion, gravity, muscular force; and in the game of human life, love, fear, justice, appetite, man, and God, interact. These laws refuse to be adequately stated. They will not be written out on paper, or spoken by the tongue. They elude our persevering thought; yet we read them hourly in each other's faces, in each other's actions, in our own remorse. The moral traits which are all globed into every virtuous act and thought, — in speech, we must sever, and describe or suggest by painful enumeration of many particulars. Yet, as this sentiment is the essence of all religion, let me guide your eye to the precise objects of the sentiment, by an enumeration of some of those classes of facts in which this element is conspicuous.

The intuition of the moral sentiment is an insight of the perfection of the laws of the soul. These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance. Thus; in the soul of man there is a justice whose retributions are instant and entire. He who does a good deed, is instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed, is by the action itself contracted. He who puts off impurity, thereby puts on purity. If a man is at heart just, then in so far is he God; the safety of God, the immortality of God, the majesty of God do enter into that man with justice. If a man dissemble, deceive, he deceives himself, and goes out of acquaintance with his own being. A man in the view of absolute goodness, adores, with total humility. Every step so downward, is a step upward. The man who renounces himself, comes to himself.

See how this rapid intrinsic energy worketh everywhere, righting wrongs, correcting appearances, and bringing up facts to a harmony with thoughts. Its operation in life, though slow to the senses, is, at last, as sure as in the soul. By it, a man is made the Providence to himself, dispensing good to his goodness, and evil to his sin. Character is always known. Thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls. The least admixture of a lie, — for example, the taint of vanity, the least attempt to make a good impression, a favorable appearance, — will instantly vitiate the effect. But speak the truth, and all nature and all spirits help you with unexpected furtherance. Speak the truth, and all things alive or brute are vouchers, and the very roots of the grass underground there, do seem to stir and move to bear you witness. See again the perfection of the Law as it applies itself to the affections, and becomes the law of society. As we are, so we associate. The good, by affinity, seek the good; the vile, by affinity, the vile. Thus of their own volition, souls proceed into heaven, into hell.

These facts have always suggested to man the sublime creed, that the world is not the product of manifold power, but of one will, of one mind; and that one mind is everywhere active, in each ray of the star, in each wavelet of the pool; and whatever opposes that will, is everywhere balked and baffled, because things are made so, and not otherwise. Good is positive. Evil is merely privative, not absolute: it is like cold, which is the privation of heat. All evil is so much death or nonentity. Benevolence is absolute and real. So much benevolence as a man hath, so much life hath he. For all things proceed out of this same spirit, which is differently named love, justice, temperance, in its different applications, just as the ocean receives different names on the several shores which it washes. All things proceed out of the same spirit, and all things conspire with it. Whilst a man seeks good ends, he is strong by the whole strength of nature. In so far as he roves from these ends, he bereaves himself of power, of auxiliaries; his being shrinks out of all remote channels, he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until absolute badness is absolute death.

The perception of this law of laws awakens in the mind a sentiment which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the embalmer of the world. It is myrrh and storax, and chlorine and rosemary. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of the stars is it. By it, is the universe made safe and habitable, not by science or power. Thought may work cold and intransitive in things, and find no end or unity; but the dawn of the sentiment of virtue on the heart, gives and is the assurance that Law is sovereign over all natures; and the worlds, time, space, eternity, do seem to break out into joy.

This sentiment is divine and deifying. It is the beatitude of man. It makes him illimitable. Through it, the soul first knows itself. It corrects the capital mistake of the infant man, who seeks to be great by following the great, and hopes to derive advantages from another, — by showing the fountain of all good to be in himself, and that he, equally with every man, is an inlet into the deeps of Reason. When he says, "I ought;" when love warms him; when he chooses, warned from on high, the good and great deed; then, deep melodies wander through his soul from Supreme Wisdom. Then he can worship, and be enlarged by his worship; for he can never go behind this sentiment. In the sublimest flights of the soul, rectitude is never surmounted, love is never outgrown.

This sentiment lies at the foundation of society, and successively creates all forms of worship. The principle of veneration never dies out. Man fallen into superstition, into sensuality, is never quite without the visions of the moral sentiment. In like manner, all the expressions of this sentiment are sacred and permanent in proportion to their purity. The expressions of this sentiment affect us more than all other compositions. The sentences of the oldest time, which ejaculate this piety, are still fresh and fragrant. This thought dwelled always deepest in the minds of men in the devout and contemplative East; not alone in Palestine, where it reached its purest expression, but in Egypt, in Persia, in India, in China. Europe has always owed to oriental genius, its divine impulses. What these holy bards said, all sane men found agreeable and true. And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose name is not so much written as ploughed into the history of this world, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion.

Meantime, whilst the doors of the temple stand open, night and day, before every man, and the oracles of this truth cease never, it is guarded by one stern condition; this, namely; it is an intuition. It cannot be received at second hand. Truly speaking, it is not instruction, but provocation, that I can receive from another soul. What he announces, I must find true in me, or wholly reject; and on his word, or as his second, be he who he may, I can accept nothing. On the contrary, the absence of this primary faith is the presence of degradation. As is the flood so is the ebb. Let this faith depart, and the very words it spake, and the things it made, become false and hurtful. Then falls the church, the state, art, letters, life. The doctrine of the divine nature being forgotten, a sickness infects and dwarfs the constitution. Once man was all; now he is an appendage, a nuisance. And because the indwelling Supreme Spirit cannot wholly be got rid of, the doctrine of it suffers this perversion, that the divine nature is attributed to one or two persons, and denied to all the rest, and denied with fury. The doctrine of inspiration is lost; the base doctrine of the majority of voices, usurps the place of the doctrine of the soul. Miracles, prophecy, poetry; the ideal life, the holy life, exist as ancient history merely; they are not in the belief, nor in the aspiration of society; but, when suggested, seem ridiculous. Life is comic or pitiful, as soon as the high ends of being fade out of sight, and man becomes near-sighted, and can only attend to what addresses the senses.

These general views, which, whilst they are general, none will contest, find abundant illustration in the history of religion, and especially in the history of the Christian church. In that, all of us have had our birth and nurture. The truth contained in that, you, my young friends, are now setting forth to teach. As the Cultus, or established worship of the civilized world, it has great historical interest for us. Of its blessed words, which have been the consolation of humanity, you need not that I should speak. I shall endeavor to discharge my duty to you, on this occasion, by pointing out two errors in its administration, which daily appear more gross from the point of view we have just now taken.

Jesus Christ belonged to the true race of prophets. He saw with open eye the mystery of the soul. Drawn by its severe harmony, ravished with its beauty, he lived in it, and had his being there. Alone in all history, he estimated the greatness of man. One man was true to what is in you and me. He saw that God incarnates himself in man, and evermore goes forth anew to take possession of his world. He said, in this jubilee of sublime emotion, `I am divine. Through me, God acts; through me, speaks. Would you see God, see me; or, see thee, when thou also thinkest as I now think.' But what a distortion did his doctrine and memory suffer in the same, in the next, and the following ages! There is no doctrine of the Reason which will bear to be taught by the Understanding. The understanding caught this high chant from the poet's lips, and said, in the next age, `This was Jehovah come down out of heaven. I will kill you, if you say he was a man.' The idioms of his language, and the figures of his rhetoric, have usurped the place of his truth; and churches are not built on his principles, but on his tropes. Christianity became a Mythus, as the poetic teaching of Greece and of Egypt, before. He spoke of miracles; for he felt that man's life was a miracle, and all that man doth, and he knew that this daily miracle shines, as the character ascends. But the word Miracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is Monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain.

He felt respect for Moses and the prophets; but no unfit tenderness at postponing their initial revelations, to the hour and the man that now is; to the eternal revelation in the heart. Thus was he a true man. Having seen that the law in us is commanding, he would not suffer it to be commanded. Boldly, with hand, and heart, and life, he declared it was God. Thus is he, as I think, the only soul in history who has appreciated the worth of a man.

1. In this point of view we become very sensible of the first defect of historical Christianity. Historical Christianity has fallen into the error that corrupts all attempts to communicate religion. As it appears to us, and as it has appeared for ages, it is not the doctrine of the soul, but an exaggeration of the personal, the positive, the ritual. It has dwelt, it dwells, with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus. The soul knows no persons. It invites every man to expand to the full circle of the universe, and will have no preferences but those of spontaneous love. But by this eastern monarchy of a Christianity, which indolence and fear have built, the friend of man is made the injurer of man. The manner in which his name is surrounded with expressions, which were once sallies of admiration and love, but are now petrified into official titles, kills all generous sympathy and liking. All who hear me, feel, that the language that describes Christ to Europe and America, is not the style of friendship and enthusiasm to a good and noble heart, but is appropriated and formal, — paints a demigod, as the Orientals or the Greeks would describe Osiris or Apollo. Accept the injurious impositions of our early catachetical instruction, and even honesty and self-denial were but splendid sins, if they did not wear the Christian name. One would rather be

`A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,'

than to be defrauded of his manly right in coming into nature, and finding not names and places, not land and professions, but even virtue and truth foreclosed and monopolized. You shall not be a man even. You shall not own the world; you shall not dare, and live after the infinite Law that is in you, and in company with the infinite Beauty which heaven and earth reflect to you in all lovely forms; but you must subordinate your nature to Christ's nature; you must accept our interpretations; and take his portrait as the vulgar draw it.

That is always best which gives me to myself. The sublime is excited in me by the great stoical doctrine, Obey thyself. That which shows God in me, fortifies me. That which shows God out of me, makes me a wart and a wen. There is no longer a necessary reason for my being. Already the long shadows of untimely oblivion creep over me, and I shall decease forever.

The divine bards are the friends of my virtue, of my intellect of my strength. They admonish me, that the gleams which flash across my mind, are not mine, but God's; that they had the like, and were not disobedient to the heavenly vision. So I love them. Noble provocations go out from them, inviting me to resist evil; to subdue the world; and to Be. And thus by his holy thoughts, Jesus serves us, and thus only. To aim to convert a man by miracles, is a profanation of the soul. A true conversion, a true Christ, is now, as always, to be made, by the reception of beautiful sentiments. It is true that a great and rich soul, like his, falling among the simple, does so preponderate, that, as his did, it names the world. The world seems to them to exist for him, and they have not yet drunk so deeply of his sense, as to see that only by coming again to themselves, or to God in themselves, can they grow forevermore. It is a low benefit to give me something; it is a high benefit to enable me to do somewhat of myself. The time is coming when all men will see, that the gift of God to the soul is not a vaunting, overpowering, excluding sanctity, but a sweet, natural goodness, a goodness like thine and mine, and that so invites thine and mine to be and to grow.

The injustice of the vulgar tone of preaching is not less flagrant to Jesus, than to the souls which it profanes. The preachers do not see that they make his gospel not glad, and shear him of the locks of beauty and the attributes of heaven. When I see a majestic Epaminondas, or Washington; when I see among my contemporaries, a true orator, an upright judge, a dear friend; when I vibrate to the melody and fancy of a poem; I see beauty that is to be desired. And so lovely, and with yet more entire consent of my human being, sounds in my ear the severe music of the bards that have sung of the true God in all ages. Now do not degrade the life and dialogues of Christ out of the circle of this charm, by insulation and peculiarity. Let them lie as they befel, alive and warm, part of human life, and of the landscape, and of the cheerful day.

2. The second defect of the traditionary and limited way of using the mind of Christ is a consequence of the first; this, namely; that the Moral Nature, that Law of laws, whose revelations introduce greatness, — yea, God himself, into the open soul, is not explored as the fountain of the established teaching in society. Men have come to speak of the revelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. The injury to faith throttles the preacher; and the goodliest of institutions becomes an uncertain and inarticulate voice.

It is very certain that it is the effect of conversation with the beauty of the soul, to beget a desire and need to impart to others the same knowledge and love. If utterance is denied, the thought lies like a burden on the man. Always the seer is a sayer. Somehow his dream is told: somehow he publishes it with solemn joy: sometimes with pencil on canvas; sometimes with chisel on stone; sometimes in towers and aisles of granite, his soul's worship is builded; sometimes in anthems of indefinite music; but clearest and most permanent, in words.

The man enamored of this excellency, becomes its priest or poet. The office is coeval with the world. But observe the condition, the spiritual limitation of the office. The spirit only can teach. Not any profane man, not any sensual, not any liar, not any slave can teach, but only he can give, who has; he only can create, who is. The man on whom the soul descends, through whom the soul speaks, alone can teach. Courage, piety, love, wisdom, can teach; and every man can open his door to these angels, and they shall bring him the gift of tongues. But the man who aims to speak as books enable, as synods use, as the fashion guides, and as interest commands, babbles. Let him hush.

To this holy office, you propose to devote yourselves. I wish you may feel your call in throbs of desire and hope. The office is the first in the world. It is of that reality, that it cannot suffer the deduction of any falsehood. And it is my duty to say to you, that the need was never greater of new revelation than now. From the views I have already expressed, you will infer the sad conviction, which I share, I believe, with numbers, of the universal decay and now almost death of faith in society. The soul is not preached. The Church seems to totter to its fall, almost all life extinct. On this occasion, any complaisance would be criminal, which told you, whose hope and commission it is to preach the faith of Christ, that the faith of Christ is preached.

It is time that this ill-suppressed murmur of all thoughtful men against the famine of our churches; this moaning of the heart because it is bereaved of the consolation, the hope, the grandeur, that come alone out of the culture of the moral nature; should be heard through the sleep of indolence, and over the din of routine. This great and perpetual office of the preacher is not discharged. Preaching is the expression of the moral sentiment in application to the duties of life. In how many churches, by how many prophets, tell me, is man made sensible that he is an infinite Soul; that the earth and heavens are passing into his mind; that he is drinking forever the soul of God? Where now sounds the persuasion, that by its very melody imparadises my heart, and so affirms its own origin in heaven? Where shall I hear words such as in elder ages drew men to leave all and follow, — father and mother, house and land, wife and child? Where shall I hear these august laws of moral being so pronounced, as to fill my ear, and I feel ennobled by the offer of my uttermost action and passion? The test of the true faith, certainly, should be its power to charm and command the soul, as the laws of nature control the activity of the hands, — so commanding that we find pleasure and honor in obeying. The faith should blend with the light of rising and of setting suns, with the flying cloud, the singing bird, and the breath of flowers. But now the priest's Sabbath has lost the splendor of nature; it is unlovely; we are glad when it is done; we can make, we do make, even sitting in our pews, a far better, holier, sweeter, for ourselves.

Whenever the pulpit is usurped by a formalist, then is the worshipper defrauded and disconsolate. We shrink as soon as the prayers begin, which do not uplift, but smite and offend us. We are fain to wrap our cloaks about us, and secure, as best we can, a solitude that hears not. I once heard a preacher who sorely tempted me to say, I would go to church no more. Men go, thought I, where they are wont to go, else had no soul entered the temple in the afternoon. A snow storm was falling around us. The snow storm was real; the preacher merely spectral; and the eye felt the sad contrast in looking at him, and then out of the window behind him, into the beautiful meteor of the snow. He had lived in vain. He had no one word intimating that he had laughed or wept, was married or in love, had been commended, or cheated, or chagrined. If he had ever lived and acted, we were none the wiser for it. The capital secret of his profession, namely, to convert life into truth, he had not learned. Not one fact in all his experience, had he yet imported into his doctrine. This man had ploughed, and planted, and talked, and bought, and sold; he had read books; he had eaten and drunken; his head aches; his heart throbs; he smiles and suffers; yet was there not a surmise, a hint, in all the discourse, that he had ever lived at all. Not a line did he draw out of real history. The true preacher can be known by this, that he deals out to the people his life, — life passed through the fire of thought. But of the bad preacher, it could not be told from his sermon, what age of the world he fell in; whether he had a father or a child; whether he was a freeholder or a pauper; whether he was a citizen or a countryman; or any other fact of his biography. It seemed strange that the people should come to church. It seemed as if their houses were very unentertaining, that they should prefer this thoughtless clamor. It shows that there is a commanding attraction in the moral sentiment, that can lend a faint tint of light to dulness and ignorance, coming in its name and place. The good hearer is sure he has been touched sometimes; is sure there is somewhat to be reached, and some word that can reach it. When he listens to these vain words, he comforts himself by their relation to his remembrance of better hours, and so they clatter and echo unchallenged.

I am not ignorant that when we preach unworthily, it is not always quite in vain. There is a good ear, in some men, that draws supplies to virtue out of very indifferent nutriment. There is poetic truth concealed in all the common-places of prayer and of sermons, and though foolishly spoken, they may be wisely heard; for, each is some select expression that broke out in a moment of piety from some stricken or jubilant soul, and its excellency made it remembered. The prayers and even the dogmas of our church, are like the zodiac of Denderah, and the astronomical monuments of the Hindoos, wholly insulated from anything now extant in the life and business of the people. They mark the height to which the waters once rose. But this docility is a check upon the mischief from the good and devout. In a large portion of the community, the religious service gives rise to quite other thoughts and emotions. We need not chide the negligent servant. We are struck with pity, rather, at the swift retribution of his sloth. Alas for the unhappy man that is called to stand in the pulpit, and not give bread of life. Everything that befalls, accuses him. Would he ask contributions for the missions, foreign or domestic? Instantly his face is suffused with shame, to propose to his parish, that they should send money a hundred or a thousand miles, to furnish such poor fare as they have at home, and would do well to go the hundred or the thousand miles to escape. Would he urge people to a godly way of living; — and can he ask a fellow-creature to come to Sabbath meetings, when he and they all know what is the poor uttermost they can hope for therein? Will he invite them privately to the Lord's Supper? He dares not. If no heart warm this rite, the hollow, dry, creaking formality is too plain, than that he can face a man of wit and energy, and put the invitation without terror. In the street, what has he to say to the bold village blasphemer? The village blasphemer sees fear in the face, form, and gait of the minister.

Let me not taint the sincerity of this plea by any oversight of the claims of good men. I know and honor the purity and strict conscience of numbers of the clergy. What life the public worship retains, it owes to the scattered company of pious men, who minister here and there in the churches, and who, sometimes accepting with too great tenderness the tenet of the elders, have not accepted from others, but from their own heart, the genuine impulses of virtue, and so still command our love and awe, to the sanctity of character. Moreover, the exceptions are not so much to be found in a few eminent preachers, as in the better hours, the truer inspirations of all, — nay, in the sincere moments of every man. But with whatever exception, it is still true, that tradition characterizes the preaching of this country; that it comes out of the memory, and not out of the soul; that it aims at what is usual, and not at what is necessary and eternal; that thus, historical Christianity destroys the power of preaching, by withdrawing it from the exploration of the moral nature of man, where the sublime is, where are the resources of astonishment and power. What a cruel injustice it is to that Law, the joy of the whole earth, which alone can make thought dear and rich; that Law whose fatal sureness the astronomical orbits poorly emulate, that it is travestied and depreciated, that it is behooted and behowled, and not a trait, not a word of it articulated. The pulpit in losing sight of this Law, loses its reason, and gropes after it knows not what. And for want of this culture, the soul of the community is sick and faithless. It wants nothing so much as a stern, high, stoical, Christian discipline, to make it know itself and the divinity that speaks through it. Now man is ashamed of himself; he skulks and sneaks through the world, to be tolerated, to be pitied, and scarcely in a thousand years does any man dare to be wise and good, and so draw after him the tears and blessings of his kind.

Certainly there have been periods when, from the inactivity of the intellect on certain truths, a greater faith was possible in names and persons. The Puritans in England and America, found in the Christ of the Catholic Church, and in the dogmas inherited from Rome, scope for their austere piety, and their longings for civil freedom. But their creed is passing away, and none arises in its room. I think no man can go with his thoughts about him, into one of our churches, without feeling, that what hold the public worship had on men is gone, or going. It has lost its grasp on the affection of the good, and the fear of the bad. In the country, neighborhoods, half parishes are signing off, — to use the local term. It is already beginning to indicate character and religion to withdraw from the religious meetings. I have heard a devout person, who prized the Sabbath, say in bitterness of heart, "On Sundays, it seems wicked to go to church." And the motive, that holds the best there, is now only a hope and a waiting. What was once a mere circumstance, that the best and the worst men in the parish, the poor and the rich, the learned and the ignorant, young and old, should meet one day as fellows in one house, in sign of an equal right in the soul, — has come to be a paramount motive for going thither.

My friends, in these two errors, I think, I find the causes of a decaying church and a wasting unbelief. And what greater calamity can fall upon a nation, than the loss of worship? Then all things go to decay. Genius leaves the temple, to haunt the senate, or the market. Literature becomes frivolous. Science is cold. The eye of youth is not lighted by the hope of other worlds, and age is without honor. Society lives to trifles, and when men die, we do not mention them.

And now, my brothers, you will ask, What in these desponding days can be done by us? The remedy is already declared in the ground of our complaint of the Church. We have contrasted the Church with the Soul. In the soul, then, let the redemption be sought. Wherever a man comes, there comes revolution. The old is for slaves. When a man comes, all books are legible, all things transparent, all religions are forms. He is religious. Man is the wonderworker. He is seen amid miracles. All men bless and curse. He saith yea and nay, only. The stationariness of religion; the assumption that the age of inspiration is past, that the Bible is closed; the fear of degrading the character of Jesus by representing him as a man; indicate with sufficient clearness the falsehood of our theology. It is the office of a true teacher to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake. The true Christianity, — a faith like Christ's in the infinitude of man, — is lost. None believeth in the soul of man, but only in some man or person old and departed. Ah me! no man goeth alone. All men go in flocks to this saint or that poet, avoiding the God who seeth in secret. They cannot see in secret; they love to be blind in public. They think society wiser than their soul, and know not that one soul, and their soul, is wiser than the whole world. See how nations and races flit by on the sea of time, and leave no ripple to tell where they floated or sunk, and one good soul shall make the name of Moses, or of Zeno, or of Zoroaster, reverend forever. None assayeth the stern ambition to be the Self of the nation, and of nature, but each would be an easy secondary to some Christian scheme, or sectarian connection, or some eminent man. Once leave your own knowledge of God, your own sentiment, and take secondary knowledge, as St. Paul's, or George Fox's, or Swedenborg's, and you get wide from God with every year this secondary form lasts, and if, as now, for centuries, — the chasm yawns to that breadth, that men can scarcely be convinced there is in them anything divine.

Let me admonish you, first of all, to go alone; to refuse the good models, even those which are sacred in the imagination of men, and dare to love God without mediator or veil. Friends enough you shall find who will hold up to your emulation Wesleys and Oberlins, Saints and Prophets. Thank God for these good men, but say, `I also am a man.' Imitation cannot go above its model. The imitator dooms himself to hopeless mediocrity. The inventor did it, because it was natural to him, and so in him it has a charm. In the imitator, something else is natural, and he bereaves himself of his own beauty, to come short of another man's.

Yourself a newborn bard of the Holy Ghost, — cast behind you all conformity, and acquaint men at first hand with Deity. Look to it first and only, that fashion, custom, authority, pleasure, and money, are nothing to you, — are not bandages over your eyes, that you cannot see, — but live with the privilege of the immeasurable mind. Not too anxious to visit periodically all families and each family in your parish connection, — when you meet one of these men or women, be to them a divine man; be to them thought and virtue; let their timid aspirations find in you a friend; let their trampled instincts be genially tempted out in your atmosphere; let their doubts know that you have doubted, and their wonder feel that you have wondered. By trusting your own heart, you shall gain more confidence in other men. For all our penny-wisdom, for all our soul-destroying slavery to habit, it is not to be doubted, that all men have sublime thoughts; that all men value the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; they love to be caught up into the vision of principles. We mark with light in the memory the few interviews we have had, in the dreary years of routine and of sin, with souls that made our souls wiser; that spoke what we thought; that told us what we knew; that gave us leave to be what we inly were. Discharge to men the priestly office, and, present or absent, you shall be followed with their love as by an angel.

And, to this end, let us not aim at common degrees of merit. Can we not leave, to such as love it, the virtue that glitters for the commendation of society, and ourselves pierce the deep solitudes of absolute ability and worth? We easily come up to the standard of goodness in society. Society's praise can be cheaply secured, and almost all men are content with those easy merits; but the instant effect of conversing with God, will be, to put them away. There are persons who are not actors, not speakers, but influences; persons too great for fame, for display; who disdain eloquence; to whom all we call art and artist, seems too nearly allied to show and by-ends, to the exaggeration of the finite and selfish, and loss of the universal. The orators, the poets, the commanders encroach on us only as fair women do, by our allowance and homage. Slight them by preoccupation of mind, slight them, as you can well afford to do, by high and universal aims, and they instantly feel that you have right, and that it is in lower places that they must shine. They also feel your right; for they with you are open to the influx of the all-knowing Spirit, which annihilates before its broad noon the little shades and gradations of intelligence in the compositions we call wiser and wisest.

In such high communion, let us study the grand strokes of rectitude: a bold benevolence, an independence of friends, so that not the unjust wishes of those who love us, shall impair our freedom, but we shall resist for truth's sake the freest flow of kindness, and appeal to sympathies far in advance; and, — what is the highest form in which we know this beautiful element, — a certain solidity of merit, that has nothing to do with opinion, and which is so essentially and manifestly virtue, that it is taken for granted, that the right, the brave, the generous step will be taken by it, and nobody thinks of commending it. You would compliment a coxcomb doing a good act, but you would not praise an angel. The silence that accepts merit as the most natural thing in the world, is the highest applause. Such souls, when they appear, are the Imperial Guard of Virtue, the perpetual reserve, the dictators of fortune. One needs not praise their courage, — they are the heart and soul of nature. O my friends, there are resources in us on which we have not drawn. There are men who rise refreshed on hearing a threat; men to whom a crisis which intimidates and paralyzes the majority, — demanding not the faculties of prudence and thrift, but comprehension, immovableness, the readiness of sacrifice, — comes graceful and beloved as a bride. Napoleon said of Massena, that he was not himself until the battle began to go against him; then, when the dead began to fall in ranks around him, awoke his powers of combination, and he put on terror and victory as a robe. So it is in rugged crises, in unweariable endurance, and in aims which put sympathy out of question, that the angel is shown. But these are heights that we can scarce remember and look up to, without contrition and shame. Let us thank God that such things exist.

And now let us do what we can to rekindle the smoldering, nigh quenched fire on the altar. The evils of the church that now is are manifest. The question returns, What shall we do? I confess, all attempts to project and establish a Cultus with new rites and forms, seem to me vain. Faith makes us, and not we it, and faith makes its own forms. All attempts to contrive a system are as cold as the new worship introduced by the French to the goddess of Reason, — to-day, pasteboard and fillagree, and ending to-morrow in madness and murder. Rather let the breath of new life be breathed by you through the forms already existing. For, if once you are alive, you shall find they shall become plastic and new. The remedy to their deformity is, first, soul, and second, soul, and evermore, soul. A whole popedom of forms, one pulsation of virtue can uplift and vivify. Two inestimable advantages Christianity has given us; first; the Sabbath, the jubilee of the whole world; whose light dawns welcome alike into the closet of the philosopher, into the garret of toil, and into prison cells, and everywhere suggests, even to the vile, the dignity of spiritual being. Let it stand forevermore, a temple, which new love, new faith, new sight shall restore to more than its first splendor to mankind. And secondly, the institution of preaching, — the speech of man to men, — essentially the most flexible of all organs, of all forms. What hinders that now, everywhere, in pulpits, in lecture-rooms, in houses, in fields, wherever the invitation of men or your own occasions lead you, you speak the very truth, as your life and conscience teach it, and cheer the waiting, fainting hearts of men with new hope and new revelation?

I look for the hour when that supreme Beauty, which ravished the souls of those eastern men, and chiefly of those Hebrews, and through their lips spoke oracles to all time, shall speak in the West also. The Hebrew and Greek Scriptures contain immortal sentences, that have been bread of life to millions. But they have no epical integrity; are fragmentary; are not shown in their order to the intellect. I look for the new Teacher, that shall follow so far those shining laws, that he shall see them come full circle; shall see their rounding complete grace; shall see the world to be the mirror of the soul; shall see the identity of the law of gravitation with purity of heart; and shall show that the Ought, that Duty, is one thing with Science, with Beauty, and with Joy.

Thank you Wallis Annenberg and a special thank you to Dean Willow Bay for inviting me here today. And to the parents, again I say, and to the faculty, friends, graduates, good morning.

I want to give a special shout out because I was happy that Dean Bay invited me but I was going to be here anyway because one of my lovely daughter girls attends the Annenberg School of Journalism and is getting her masters today, so I was coming whether I was speaking or not. So a special shoutout to a young woman who I met when she was in the seventh grade and it was the first year that I was looking for smart, bright, giving, resilient, kind, open-hearted girls who had “it”—that factor that means you keep going no matter what. And this was the year that I chose everybody individually. And I remember her walking into the office in a little township where we were doing interviews all over South Africa and she came in and recited a poem about her teacher and when she walked out the door I go, “That’s an ‘it’ girl.” Thando Dlomo, I’m here to say I am so proud of you. Long way from the township in South Africa and her Aunt has flown 30 hours to be here for this celebration today. Thank you so much.

Today I come bearing some good news and some bad news for anybody who intends to build their life around your ability to communicate. So, I want to get the bad news out first so you can be clear. I always like to get the bad stuff upfront, so here it is: Everything around us, including—and in particular the internet and social media—is now being used to erode trust in our institutions, interfere in our elections, and wreak havoc on our infrastructure. It hands advertisers a map to our deepest desires, it enables misinformation to run rampant, attention spans to run short and false stories from phony sites to run circles around major news outlets. We have literally walked into traffic while staring at our phones.

Now the good news: Many of your parents are probably taking you somewhere really special for dinner tonight. I heard. I can do a little better than that. Now that I have presented some of the bad news, the good news is that there really is a solution. And the solution is each and every one of you. Because you will become the new editorial gatekeepers, an ambitious army of truth seekers who will arm yourselves with the intelligence, with the insight and the facts necessary to strike down deceit. You’re in a position to keep all of those who now disparage real news, you all are the ones that are going to keep those people in check. Why? Because you can push back and you can answer false narratives with real information and you can set the record straight. And you also have the ability and the power to give voice, as Dean Bay was saying, to people who desperately now need to tell their stories and have their stories told.

And this is what I do know for sure because I’ve been doing it a long time: If you can just capture the humanity of the people of the stories you’re telling, you then get that much closer to your own humanity. And you can confront your bias and you can build your credibility and hone your instincts and compound your compassion. You can use your gifts, that’s what you’re really here to do, to illuminate the darkness in our world.

So this is what I also know: This moment in time, this is your time to rise. It is. Even though you can’t go anywhere, you can’t stand in line at Starbucks, you can’t go to a party, you can’t go any place where anywhere you turn people are talking about how bad things are, how terrible it is. And this is what I know: The problem is everybody is meeting hysteria with more hysteria and then we’re all becoming hysterical and it’s getting worse. What I’ve learned all these years is that we’re not supposed to match it or even get locked into resisting or pushing against it. We’re supposed to see this moment in time for what it is. We’re supposed to see through it and then transcend it. That is how you overcome hysteria. And that is how you overcome the sniping at one another, the trolling, the mean-spirited partisanship on both sides of the aisle, the divisiveness, the injustices, and the out-and-out hatred. You use it. Use this moment to encourage you, to embolden you, and to literally push you into the rising of your life. And to borrow a phrase from my beloved mentor Maya Angelou: Just like moons and like suns, with the certainty of tides, just like hopes springing high, you will rise.

So your job now, let me tell you, is to take everything you’ve learned here and use what you learned to challenge the left, to challenge the right, and the center. When you see something, you say something, and you say it with the facts and the reporting to back it up. Here’s what you have to do: You make the choice everyday, every single day, to exemplify honesty because the truth, let me tell you something about the truth, the truth exonerates and it convicts. It disinfects and it galvanizes. The truth has always been and will always be our shield against corruption, our shield against greed and despair. The truth is our saving grace. And not only are you here, USC Annenberg, to tell it, to write it, to proclaim it, to speak it, but to be it. Be the truth. Be the truth.

So I want to get down to the real reason we’re here today. In about an hour and a half, you’re going to be catapulted into a world that appears to have gone off its rocker. And I can tell you I’ve hosted the Oprah show for 25 years, number one show. Never missed a day. Never missed a day. Twenty five years, 4,561 shows. So I know how to talk, I can tell you that, but I was a little intimidated coming here because graduations, it’s tough, it’s hard trying to come up with something to share with you that you haven’t already heard. Any information or guidance I can offer is nothing that your parents or your deans or professors or Siri haven’t already provided. So I’m here to really tell you: I don’t have any new lessons. I don’t have any new lessons. But I often think that it’s not the new lessons so much as it is really learning the old ones again and again.

So here are variations on a few grand themes beginning with this: Pick a problem, any problem, the list is long. Here are just a few that are at the top of my list. There’s gun violence and there’s climate change, there’s systemic racism, economic inequality, media bias. The homeless need opportunity, the addicted need treatment, the Dreamers need protection, the prison system needs reforming, the LGBTQ community needs acceptance, the social safety net needs saving, and the misogyny needs to stop. Needs to stop. But you can’t fix everything and you can’t save every soul. But what can you do? Here and now I believe you have to declare war on one of our most dangerous enemies, and that is cynicism. Because when that little creature sinks its hooks into you, it’ll cloud your clarity, it’ll compromise your integrity, it’ll lower your standards, it’ll choke your empathy. And sooner or later, cynicism shatters your faith. When you hear yourself saying, “Ah, it doesn’t matter what one person says, oh well, so what, it doesn’t matter what I do, who cares?” When you hear yourself saying that, know that you’re on a collision course for our culture. And I understand how it’s so easy to become disillusioned, so tempting to allow apathy to set in, because anxiety is being broadcast on 157 channels, 24 hours a day, all night long. And everyone I know is feeling it. But these times, these times, are here to let us know that we need to take a stand for our right to have hope and we need to take a stand with every ounce of wit and courage we can muster.

The question is: What are you willing to stand for? That question is going to follow you throughout your life. And here’s how you answer it. You put your honor where your mouth is. Put your honor where your mouth is. When you give your word, keep it. Show up. Do the work. Get your hands dirty. And then you’ll begin to draw strength from the understanding that history is still being written. You’re writing it every day. The wheels still in spin. And what you do or what you don’t do will be a part of it. You build a legacy not from one thing but from everything. I remember when I just opened my school in 2007, I came back and I had the great joy of sitting at Maya Angelou’s table. She hadn’t been able to attend the opening in South Africa. And I said to her, “Oh Maya, the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, that’s going to be my greatest legacy.” I remember she was standing at the counter making biscuits, and she turned, she put the dough down, and she looked at me and she said, “You have no idea what your legacy will be.” I said, “Excuse me? I just opened this school and these girls, and it’s going to be… ” And she said, “You have no idea what your legacy will be, because your legacy is every life you touch. Every life you touch.” That changed me.

And it’s true, you can’t personally stop anybody from walking into a school with an assault rifle, nor can you singlehandedly ensure that the rights that your mothers and grandmothers fought so hard for will be preserved for the daughters you may someday have. And it’ll take more than you alone to pull more than 40 million Americans out of poverty, but who will you be if you don’t care enough to try? And what mountains could we move, I think, what gridlock could we eradicate if we were to join forces and work together in service of something greater than ourselves? You know my deepest satisfactions and my biggest rewards have come from exactly that. Pick a problem, any problem, and do something about it. Because to somebody who’s hurting, something is everything. So, I hesitate to say this, because the rumors from my last big speech have finally died down, but here it is. Vote. Vote. Vote. Pay attention to what the people who claim to represent you are doing and saying in your name and on your behalf. They represent you and if they’ve not done right by you or if their policies are at odds with your core beliefs, then you have a responsibility to send them packing. If they go low, thank you Michelle Obama, if they go low, we go to the polls. People died for that right, they died for that right. I think about it every time I vote. So don’t let their sacrifices be in vain.

A couple other thoughts before I go. Eat a good breakfast. It really pays off. Pay your bills on time. Recycle. Make your bed. Aim high. Say thank you to people and actually really mean it. Ask for help when you need it, and put your phone away at the dinner table. Just sit on it, really. And know that what you tweet and post and Instagram today might be asked about at a job interview tomorrow, or 20 years from tomorrow. Be nice to little kids, be nice to your elders, be nice to animals, and know that it’s better to be interested than interesting. Invest in a quality mattress. I’m telling you, your back will thank you later. And don’t cheap out on your shoes. And if you’re fighting with somebody you really love, for god’s sakes find your way back to them because life is short, even on our longest days. And another thing, another thing you already definitely know that definitely bears repeating, don’t ever confuse what is legal with what is moral because they are entirely different animals. You see, in a court of law, there are loopholes and technicalities and bargains to be struck, but in life, you’re either principled or you’re not. So do the right thing, especially when nobody’s looking. And while I’m at it, do not equate money and fame with accomplishment and character, because I can assure you based on the thousands of people I’ve interviewed, one does not automatically follow the other.

Something else, something else. You need to know this. Your job is not always going to fulfill you. There will be some days that you just might be bored. Other days, you may not feel like going to work at all. Go anyway, and remember that your job is not who you are, it’s just what you are doing on the way to who you will become. Every remedial chore, every boss who takes credit for your ideas -- that is going to happen -- look for the lessons, because the lessons are always there. And the number one lesson I could offer you where your work is concerned is this: Become so skilled, so vigilant, so flat-out fantastic at what you do that your talent cannot be dismissed.

And finally, this: This will save you. Stop comparing yourself to other people. You’re only on this planet to be you, not someone else’s imitation of you. I had to learn that the hard way, on the air, live, anchoring the news. One night in my twenties, when I first started broadcasting, I was 19, moved to an anchor by the time I was 20. I was just pretending to be Barbara Walters. I was trying to talk like Barbara, act like Barbara, hold my legs like Barbara. And I was on the air, I hadn’t read the copy fully, and I called Canada, Canahdah. I cracked myself up, because I thought, Barbara would never call Canada Canahdah. And that little breakthrough, that little crack, that little moment that I stopped pretending allowed the real me to come through. Your life journey is about learning to become more of who you are and fulfilling the highest, truest expression of yourself as a human being. That’s why you’re here. You will do that through your work and your art, through your relationships and love.

And to quote Albert Einstein, “Education is what remains after we forget what we’re taught.” You’ve learned a lot here at USC. And when all that you’ve been taught begins to fade into the fabric of your life, I hope that what remains is your ability to analyze, to make distinctions, to be creative, and to wander down that road less traveled whenever you have the opportunity. And I hope that when you go, you go all in, and that your education helps you to walk that road with an open, discerning mind. Discernment is what we’re missing. And a kind heart. You know, there are 7 billion people on the planet right now. And here you are. Your degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism: This degree you’re about to get is a privilege. It’s a privilege. And that privilege obligates you to use what you’ve learned to lend a hand to somebody who doesn’t get to be here. Somebody who’s never had a ceremony like the one you’re having this morning.

So I hold you in the light, and I wish you curiosity and confidence. And I wish you ethics and enlightenment. I wish you guts. Every great decision I’ve ever made I trusted my gut. And goodness. I wish you purpose and the passion that goes along with that purpose. And here’s what I really hope: I hope that every one of you contributes to the conversation of our culture and our time. And to some genuine communication, which means, you have to connect to people exactly where they are; not where you are, but where they are. And I hope you shake things up. And when the time comes to bet on yourself, I hope you double down. Bet on yourself. I hope you always know how happy and how incredibly relieved everybody is in this room is that you’ve made it to this place, at this time, on this gorgeous day. Congratulations USC Annenberg Class of 2018!


For me, as for you, this is a day of honorable attainment. For the honor conferred upon me I am deeply grateful, and I felicitate you upon yours, even though I cannot share with you that greater satisfaction which comes from a laurel worked for and won. For many of you, doubtless, this mark of distinction which you have received today has meant greater sacrifice by your parents or by yourselves, than you anticipated when you matriculated almost four years ago. The year 1928 does not seem far in the past, but since that time, as all of us are aware, the world about us has experienced significant changes. Four years ago, if you heard and believed the tidings of the time, you could expect to take your place in a society well supplied with material things and could look forward to the not too distant time when you would be living in your own homes, each (if you believed the politicians) with a two-car garage; and, without great effort, would be providing yourselves and your families with all the necessities and amenities of life, and perhaps in addition, assure by your savings their security and your own in the future. Indeed, if you were observant, you would have seen that many of your elders had discovered a still easier road to material success. They had found that once they had accumulated a few dollars they needed only to put them in the proper place and then sit back and read in comfort the hieroglyphics called stock quotations which proclaimed that their wealth was mounting miraculously without any work or effort on their part. Many who were called and who are still pleased to call themselves the leaders of finance celebrated and assured us of an eternal future for this easy-chair mode of living. And to the stimulation of belief in this dazzling chimera were lent not only the voices of some of our public men in high office, but their influence and the material aid of the very instruments of Government which they controlled.

How sadly different is the picture which we see around us today! If only the mirage had vanished, we should not complain, for we should all be better off. But with it have vanished, not only the easy gains of speculation, but much of the savings of thrifty and prudent men and women, put by for their old age and for the education of their children. With these savings has gone, among millions of our fellow citizens, that sense of security to which they have rightly felt they are entitled in a land abundantly endowed with natural resources and with productive facilities to convert them into the necessities of life for all of our population. More calamitous still, there has vanished with the expectation of future security the certainty of today's bread and clothing and shelter.

Some of you — I hope not many — are wondering today how and where you will be able to earn your living a few weeks or a few months hence. Much has been written about the hope of youth. I prefer to emphasize another quality. I hope that you who have spent four years in an institution whose fundamental purpose, I take it, is to train us to pursue truths relentlessly and to look at them courageously, will face the unfortunate state of the world about you with greater clarity of vision than many of your elders.

As you have viewed this world of which you are about to become a more active part, I have no doubt that you have been impressed by its chaos, its lack of plan. Perhaps some of you have used stronger language. And stronger language is justified. Even had you been graduating, instead of matriculating, in these rose-colored days of 1928, you would, I believe, have perceived this condition. For beneath all the happy optimism of those days there existed lack of plan and a great waste.

This failure to measure true values and to look ahead extended to almost every industry, every profession, every walk of life. Take, for example, the vocation of higher education itself.

If you had been intending to enter the profession of teaching, you would have found that the universities, the colleges, the normal schools of our country were turning out annually far more trained teachers than the schools of the country could possibly use or absorb. You and I know that the number of teachers needed in the Nation is a relatively stable figure, little affected by the depression and capable of fairly accurate estimate in advance with due consideration for our increase in population. And yet, we have continued to add teaching courses, to accept every young man or young woman in those courses without any thought or regard for the law of supply and demand. In the State of New York alone, for example, there are at least seven thousand qualified teachers who are out of work, unable to earn a livelihood in their chosen profession just because nobody had the wit or the forethought to tell them in their younger days that the profession of teaching was gravely oversupplied.

Take, again, the profession of the law. Our common sense tells us that we have too many lawyers and that thousands of them, thoroughly trained, are either eking out a bare existence or being compelled to work with their hands, or are turning to some other business in order to keep themselves from becoming objects of charity. The universities, the bar, the courts themselves have done little to bring this situation to the knowledge of young men who are considering entering any one of our multitude of law schools. Here again foresight and planning have been notable for their complete absence.

In the same way we cannot review carefully the history of our industrial advance without being struck with its haphazardness, the gigantic waste with which it has been accomplished, the superfluous duplication of productive facilities, the continual scrapping of still useful equipment, the tremendous mortality in industrial and commercial undertakings, the thousands of dead-end trails into which enterprise has been lured, the profligate waste of natural resources. Much of this waste is the inevitable by-product of progress in a society which values individual endeavor and which is susceptible to the changing tastes and customs of the people of which it is composed. But much of it, I believe, could have been prevented by greater foresight and by a larger measure of social planning. Such controlling and directive forces as have been developed in recent years reside to a dangerous degree in groups having special interests in our economic order, interests which do not coincide with the interests of the Nation as a whole. I believe that the recent course of our history has demonstrated that, while we may utilize their expert knowledge of certain problems and the special facilities with which they are familiar, we cannot allow our economic life to be controlled by that small group of men whose chief outlook upon the social welfare is tinctured by the fact that they can make huge profits from the lending of money and the marketing of securities — an outlook which deserves the adjectives "selfish" and "opportunist."

You have been struck, I know, by the tragic irony of our economic situation today. We have not been brought to our present state by any natural calamity— by drought or floods or earthquakes or by the destruction of our productive machine or our man power. Indeed, we have a superabundance of raw materials, a more than ample supply of equipment for manufacturing these materials into the goods which we need, and transportation and commercial facilities for making them available to all who need them. But raw materials stand unused, factories stand idle, railroad traffic continues to dwindle, merchants sell less and less, while millions of able-bodied men and women, in dire need, are clamoring for the opportunity to work. This is the awful paradox with which we are confronted, a stinging rebuke that challenges our power to operate the economic machine which we have created.

We are presented with a multitude of views as to how we may again set into motion that economic machine. Some hold to the theory that the periodic slowing down of our economic machine is one of its inherent peculiarities — a peculiarity which we must grin, if we can, and bear because if we attempt to tamper with it we shall cause even worse ailments. According to this theory, as I see it, if we grin and bear long enough, the economic machine will eventually begin to pick up speed and in the course of an indefinite number of years will again attain that maximum number of revolutions which signifies what we have been wont to miscall prosperity, but which, alas, is but a last ostentatious twirl of the economic machine before it again succumbs to that mysterious impulse to slow down again. This attitude toward our economic machine requires not only greater stoicism, but greater faith in immutable economic law and less faith in the ability of man to control what he has created than I, for one, have. Whatever elements of truth lie in it, it is an invitation to sit back and do nothing; and all of us are suffering today, I believe, because this comfortable theory was too thoroughly implanted in the minds of some of our leaders, both in finance and in public affairs.

Other students of economics trace our present difficulties to the ravages of the World War and its bequest of unsolved political and economic and financial problems. Still others trace our difficulties to defects in the world's monetary systems. Whether it be an original cause, an accentuating cause, or an effect, the drastic change in the value of our monetary unit in terms of the commodities is a problem which we must meet straightforwardly. It is self-evident that we must either restore commodities to a level approximating their dollar value of several years ago or else that we must continue the destructive process of reducing, through defaults or through deliberate writing down, obligations assumed at a higher price level.

Possibly because of the urgency and complexity of this phase of our problem some of our economic thinkers have been occupied with it to the exclusion of other phases of as great importance.

Of these other phases, that which seems most important to me in the long run is the problem of controlling by adequate planning the creation and distribution of those products which our vast economic machine is capable of yielding. It is true that capital, whether public or private, is needed in the creation of new enterprise and that such capital gives employment.

But think carefully of the vast sums of capital or credit which in the past decade have been devoted to unjustified enterprises — to the development of unessentials and to the multiplying of many products far beyond the capacity of the Nation to absorb. It is the same story as the thoughtless turning out of too many school teachers and too many lawyers.

Here again, in the field of industry and business many of those whose primary solicitude is confined to the welfare of what they call capital have failed to read the lessons of the past few years and have been moved less by calm analysis of the needs of the Nation as a whole than by a blind determination to preserve their own special stakes in the economic order. I do not mean to intimate that we have come to the end of this period of expansion. We shall continue to need capital for the production of newly-invented devices, for the replacement of equipment worn out or rendered obsolete by our technical progress; we need better housing in many of our cities and we still need in many parts of the country more good roads, canals, parks and other improvements. But it seems to me probable that our physical economic plant will not expand in the future at the same rate at which it has expanded in the past. We may build more factories, but the fact remains that we have enough now to supply all of our domestic needs, and more, if they are used. With these factories we can now make more shoes, more textiles, more steel, more radios, more automobiles, more of almost everything than we can use.

No, our basic trouble was not an insufficiency of capital. It was an insufficient distribution of buying power coupled with an oversufficient speculation in production. While wages rose in many of our industries, they did not as a whole rise proportionately to the reward to capital, and at the same time the purchasing power of other great groups of our population was permitted to shrink. We accumulated such a superabundance of capital that our great bankers were Vying with each other, some of them employing questionable methods, in their efforts to lend this capital at home and abroad.

I believe that we are at the threshold of a fundamental change in our popular economic thought, that in the future we are going to think less about the producer and more about the consumer. Do what we may have to do to inject life into our ailing economic order, we cannot make it endure for long unless we can bring about a wiser, more equitable distribution of the national income.

It is well within the inventive capacity of man, who has built up this great social and economic machine capable of satisfying the wants of all, to insure that all who are willing and able to work receive from it at least the necessities of life. In such a system, the reward for a day's work will have to be greater, on the average, than it has been, and the reward to capital, especially capital which is speculative, will have to be less. But I believe that after the experience of the last three years, the average citizen would rather receive a smaller return upon his savings in return for greater security for the principal, than experience for a moment the thrill or the prospect of being a millionaire only to find the next moment that his fortune, actual or expected, has withered in his hand because the economic machine has again broken down.

It is toward that objective that we must move if we are to profit by our recent experiences. Probably few will disagree that the goal is desirable. Yet many, of faint heart, fearful of change, sitting tightly on the roof-tops in the flood, will sternly resist striking out for it, lest they fail to attain it. Even among those who are ready to attempt the journey there will be violent differences of opinion as to how it should be made. So complex, so widely distributed over our whole society are the problems which confront us that men and women of common aim do not agree upon the method of attacking them. Such disagreement leads to doing nothing, to drifting. Agreement may come too late.

Let us not confuse objectives with methods. Too many so-called leaders of the Nation fail to see the forest because of the trees. Too many of them fail to recognize the vital necessity of planning for definite objectives. True leadership calls for the setting forth of the objectives and the rallying of public opinion in support of these objectives.

Do not confuse objectives with methods. When the Nation becomes substantially united in favor of planning the broad objectives of civilization, then true leadership must unite thought behind definite methods.

The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach.

We need enthusiasm, imagination and the ability to face facts, even unpleasant ones, bravely. We need to correct, by drastic means if necessary, the faults in our economic system from which we now suffer. We need the courage of the young. Yours is not the task of making your way in the world, but the task of remaking the world which you will find before you. May every one of us be granted the courage, the faith and the vision to give the best that is in us to that remaking!

I bring a message to Sweet Briar College and especially to the Senior class so soon to step beyond its portals into the Great World. It is not a personal message that I bring and I hasten to add that it contains no advice, instruction or warning against threatening bugaboos. My message comes from millions of women now mostly past and gone. They lived in a single century; they endured, struggled, and suffered, almost unbelievably, in order that you, unborn in their day, might inherit privileges, opportunities and liberties for which they had so prayerfully longed, but were never permitted to know. I speak for those who gave a name to “The Woman’s Century”.

That great man, Victor Hugo, predicted the coming of such a century and it came. He, however, could not have told the date of its beginning or ending. Since it now is behind us, I am able to tell you that it lay between 1820 and 1920 and is the only Woman’s Century in the entire history of the human race. What happened in that one hundred years, why and how it happened, every college woman should know. She will be happier, more useful, and far more courageous for the knowledge.

Just when the Woman Movement began, no one knows. I like to think that the definite woman movement was lifted out of the disconnected and far scattered agitation by Mary Wollstonecraft’s book, “The Vindication of the Rights of Women” which was published about 1795. Into that book she put the entire case of women. In the words of Blackstone, husband and wife are one and that one is the husband. Mrs. Wollstonecraft pled that man and wife are not one, but two persons, both capable of being rational and responsible beings. Her chief plea was that she wished to place women in “a station where they would advance and not retard the progress of the human race” and these ideas became the basis of all action as the movement developed. Horace Walpole called the young author “a hyena in petticoats”. This epithet crossed the Atlantic and was applied to many women to close an argument that girls be permitted to learn the alphabet.

The status of women was practically uniform the world around at the beginning of the 19 th century. Religions controlled the marriage ceremonies. In England and America the bride promised obedience to her husband and that oath was enforced by law. Should she disagree with him, or, in any way offend him, he could legally punish her. He could whip his wife if he did not exceed the standard of severity set by public opinion. The law left no doubt on this point. The stick used by the husband must not be thicker than his thumb. He could put his wife out of his house in to the cold, or shut her up in a room without food and Courts sustained all these acts in England and America.

Codes of law existed everywhere. In this country there were eventually forty-eight of them, one for each state. These codes provided that, upon marriage, all the bride possessed, including not only all property but more intimate things, such as her trousseau, her jewels, her wedding presents, even those given her by her family, her hair pins and her engagement ring, passed into the possession of her husband. She was not permitted to manage any property, not to collect or expend any emoluments arising from it. She enjoyed the fame of ownership since real property was recorded in her name. While she lived, she had no control over it and at her death, she could not will it to others. Some work for wages, women did, but they could not legally collect or expend their own wages as the earnings of a wife belonged to her husband.

Probably women suffered most over the effects of the law which gave the father sole guardianship over the children. As mothers, women had few privileges and no rights. The husband could will away all the children if he chose and frequent cases of unborn babes being so willed occurred.

When husband and wife differed in religion, the father could direct that the children be taught his faith and the wife was obliged to so teach the children, although she did not believe what she taught. Children wore the clothes, ate the food, and lived the kind of life the father might dictate.

Other curious restrictions of individual freedom resulted from custom and public opinion only. The will of God was usually quoted to support any custom whose right to exist was questioned. Women did not speak in public, although no law forbade them. They did not pray in prayer meetings, vote or speak in business meetings of church members. In many churches men sat upon one side and women upon the other. For this custom the explanation was given that “men, uninterrupted, must be free to lift their souls to God”. Women, unmarried or widows, might keep a bank account, but they rarely entered the bank. Deposits were made and cash withdrawn by men relatives or neighbors. Women did not go on the street alone and never entered public places, other than the church, alone. Margaret Fuller, the author, once shocked all Boston by sitting down in a corner of the public library to read a book. Naturally, it followed that women had never organized for any purpose. In several countries, including France, Germany and Austria, women were prohibited from public speaking, organizing, or attending political meetings. In Germany and Austria women could get police permission to hold a meeting especially for a foreign speaker. I have, myself, spoken at such police controlled meetings in Germany and Austria where police, armed with billies, sat upon the platform prepared to dismiss the meeting at the first offensive utterance. (I was always warned as to the subjects to be avoided.) This law still obtained in Austria at the opening of the Great War.

Women did not always obey these customs of restriction and all of them finally broke down, because some women would not respect them. One amusing episode occurred in a Massachusetts small town. There, town meetings were held, the members being property holders, but women did not attend. In this town a woman always came and her husband never did. She spoke and what she said was sensible and practical. She invariably began her remarks with the words: “My husband, who was not able to come to-night, thinks . . .” Thus she gained her hearing.

When I began traveling about Eastern and Southern States, making speeches for women’s freedom, many laws had been changed, but the memories of them were fresh in the minds of the older women. I found much entertainment in collecting true tales of actual experiences of earlier times. One story was particularly amusing and illustrative. A young woman became a teacher in a country school where she received $1.00 a week and “boarded around”, that is, she boarded without pay one week in each house of the neighborhood. At the end of a year, she had saved $12 and with them she bought herself a wedding present of twelve solid silver spoons at $1 a piece. Her father presented her with a small house and garden and a cow and there she lived very happily with her young husband. Soon he sickened and died and as he had made no will, the law stepped in and gave her one-third of all the property might bring at sale. The little house, and the cow, her father’s gifts were sold and she was entitled to one-third of their sale price, her husband’s brother receiving the other two-thirds. She was told that if there were any pieces of furniture she wished to keep, she could do so and their value would be subtracted from her one-third. She chose to keep her silver spoons and her third was reduced by $12. She set herself up in a little room and went out sewing. A widower proposed to her and she accepted. Soon that husband was killed in an accident and she when through the same experience as before. Again, she chose to save her precious silver spoons and again she was charged $1.00 a piece for them. Again she took up her abode in the little room and went out sewing. Bye and bye, another man proposed, but now she pursed her lips tightly and replied: “NO! I have bought my silver spoons three times. They cost $12 in the beginning, but I have now paid $36 for them and I don’t propose to buy them again.”

Few occupations were open to women and the wages were small. The most humiliating factor was that the wife could not legally collect or expend her own wages. The earnings of a wife belonged to her husband. A popular novelist in England separated from a drunken and abusive husband. There were no divorce laws. She lived in small quarters and kept on writing “best sellers”, but the husband legally collected and spent the royalties, allowing her only enough to pay the upkeep of modest living quarters while he lived in luxury.

Naturally, it happened that some women were irritated by denial of facilities of education; others were bitterly aroused over the legal restrictions put upon married women, that is, management of property, the right to make a will, the right to collect and use their own earnings, the right to equal guardianship over children. Still others were annoyed by limitations fixed by custom only. All of these eventually were joined in one program and formed the line of progress of The Woman’s Century. Milestones, indicative of this progress, were scattered all along The Woman’s Century. The first was erected in 1820. In that year, the Governor of New York, Dewitt Clinton, in his annual message, announced that for the first time in this country a government had done something to promote education of the female sex. What New York had done was merely to incorporate a “female academy” at Waterford, founded by Mrs. Emma Willard. The next year this academy combined with another, became The Troy Female Seminary, the first institution in this country offering higher learning to girls and Mrs. Willard was the pioneer of what was thereafter called “Higher Education for Women”. Thus, the Century opened. How high the learning at Troy actually was, we do not know. Previous to 1820, there had been much agitation in country districts concerning geography as a suitable study for girls. Many pronounced it “quite inappropriate for young females”, and the most important argument on behalf of this study appears to have been this: a girl might marry a missionary or a traveler and go to strange lands in which case a knowledge of maps and the names of cities, rivers, and the countries would be useful. Presumably, geography was included in the studies at Troy. Early in the history of The Troy Seminary, visitors happened upon a public examination in geometry. The news of this revolutionary proceeding spread far and near and excited an amazing amount of comment, the press and the pulpit having much to say about it. One group declared geometry to be quite beyond the mental grasp of any woman and its study, therefore, a silly waste of time. Another group feared that girls might become so enamoured of geometry that when they married, they would desert the cradle and the kitchen in order to solve interesting geometrical problems.

The study, however, which aroused the most astonishment was physiology. Mrs. Russell Sage, who was one of the early students at Troy, told me that she remembered well that thick pieces of paper were pasted over the illustration of skeleton and muscles of the body because their parents thought them too indecent to be observed by young girls. A graduate of Mrs. Willard’s school reported that mothers left in a body when the class in physiology was announced. Pauline Wright Davis attempted to teach physiology to adult women by lectures, illustrated by a manikin. She said that many women would drop their veils, run out of the room, or even faint at the sight of the manikin. In 1826, Boston opened a High School for girls and it continued for eighteen months when it was closed in response to vituperative opposition, although no girl had left the school and every seat was taken. There was no high school for girls in that city until 1852.

From the year 1789 to 1822, girls had only been permitted to attend the public schools of Boston in the summer months where there were not enough boys to occupy the seats. At times, they were permitted to attend school two hours only in the afternoon. All over the country, the schools were primarily designed for boys and girls had their chance at them when it was convenient. Private schools, however, came to the rescue and girls learned enough to become acceptable as teachers of country schools and the lower grades in cities.

At the close of the century, no woman was uneducated for the want of schools. High schools are now in every town, universities in every state, and colleges to the right and to the left of us throughout our land. But education for girls had, by that date, traveled all the world around. I was astonished, in 1923, to find one thousand girls attending the University of Uruguay and another one thousand at the University of Chili. I have sometimes thought the most thrilling experience of my life was making a speech in the University of Peru, the oldest university of the two Americas – older than Harvard. The walls of the room where I spoke were lined with tiles brought from Spain when it was built in the time of Pizarro and his Conquistadores. Upon the tiles white winged vessels sailed the seven seas and grim forts of feudal architecture protected lands from their fierce attacks. In those days, girls peered through latticed windows, seeing but unseen. Now, other girls, with as bold an independence as any Northern born, were getting higher education in the ancient land of the Incas.

1827 The second milestone in The Women’s Century of Progress came in 1827 and was international in character. A German scientist, von Baer, proved that father and mother contributed equally to the physical and mental qualities of their child. Before that date, it was uniformly held that the human and animal male possessed the sole power of reproduction. Equal physical responsibility, now established, opened the question as to the extent the mother influenced the mental and moral character of children, and brought to the attention of the thinking public Mrs. Wollstonecraft’s plea that women should be qualified to advance rather than to retard the progress of the race. Personally, I believe the liberation of women would have been greatly delayed were this discovery not made and accepted promptly by scientific men.

In 1833, came the third milestone: Oberlin College, in Ohio, admitted girls. It was the first college in the modern world to admit women. No class was ready to graduate until 1841 when three girls in that class took the first degrees ever received by women.

The fourth and fifth milestones came in 1840. Harriet Martineau, the first woman in the world to interest herself in political science, visited the Untied States. She reported that at that time seven paid occupations were open to women in this country. These were teaching primary schools, needle work, keeping boarders, household service, working in cotton factories, typesetting and bookbinding. All of these occupations were learned and used in the home except typesetting. This has given us a standard from which to measure progress.

More important than this was the first World’s Anti-Slavery Convention held in London. The great event that has outlived the convention itself was the long, stormy, and vehement debate over the admission of women delegates. The women delegates were voted out, whereupon William Lloyd Garrison and Nathaniel P. Rogers refused to sit in the convention, but sat in the gallery with the women. Lucretia Mott, a rejected delegate, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the bride of a delegate, indignant at the treatment the women had received, planned to call a convention upon their return to America, which would consider the status of women and how to improve it.

In 1848, the sixth milestone was set up. The convention Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had planned eight years before was called and held at Seneca Falls, New York, where a declaration of principles was presented, endorsing women’s rights to property and wages, education, more employments, and the vote. This was signed by one hundred men and women. Two weeks later the delegates met again in Rochester and finished their work. This program remained practically unchanged till the end in 1920. In this same year, 1848, the first woman physician in the world was graduated at a medical school at Geneva, New York, namely, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.

1860. The Civil War drove all citizen, North and South, to devote themselves exclusively to that sad catastrophe. In the forty years from the beginning of The Woman’s Century in 1820 and 1860, fifteen states had granted married women the right to make a will, three states had given married women the right to control their own property. An unknown number of seminaries, promising higher learning, had been established, and a few colleges had opened their doors to women. The Civil War made one contribution to the Woman Movement. It opened positions in the Washington departments of government to women. In 1862, there were seven women. In 1870, General Spinner, who had such employees in charge, reported thousands so employed.

The seventh milestone came in 1869. Wyoming granted full suffrage to women on equal terms with men, and there women voted for the first time in the modern world. In that year, the woman movement was reorganized into two National Associations, but with the same program. These Associations were merged in 1890 and Wyoming was admitted to Statehood with woman suffrage in its constitution. Meanwhile, in every state, campaigns had been waging for the correction of women’s legal status. By 1900, every woman in the United States, and many other countries, had the right to make a will. The right to control their own property had been extended to women in many states, but with heavy restrictions in some. The right to collect and control her wages had been granted in all states although with restrictions in some states. For eight years women had been suppliants for the removal of these three oppressions. The battle had often been hard and bitterly fought. One hundred and forty-seven laws had been required to right the wrongs and they had been passed. There is still work to be done before these laws in some states are made equal for men and women.

The vote came next and last upon the program, but had advantages. Women were employed and owned property. They made contributions to campaign funds not possible in earlier years. There were college women and professional women to advise and all women had gained a self-reliance their mothers had not known. They organized more closely, waged their campaign with better strategy and more assurance and, at the end of The Woman’s Century in 1920, every woman in this, and twenty other countries, had the vote. All the world around women enjoyed a freedom of which their grandmothers never dreamed.

To the task of winning the vote women now enlisted a fresh army under old banners. Before the end, that peaceful army numbered more than two millions. They scattered tons of literature in all the languages read in this country. They spoke on street corners to chance hearers and in larger halls to great audiences. They organized their propaganda and were heard in the church, the theatre, the baseball field, and even the circus. Millions of dollars were raised mainly in small sums and expended with economic care. Hundreds of women gave the accumulated possibilities of an entire lifetime, thousands gave years of their lives, and hundreds of thousands gave constant interest and such aid as they could. In fifty-two years of pauseless campaign, women conducted 45 State referenda to male voters; 480 campaigns to urge Legislatures to submit woman suffrage amendments to voters; 47 campaigns to induce State Constitutional Conventions to write woman suffrage into State Constitutions; 277 campaigns to persuade State party conventions to include woman suffrage planks, 30 campaigns to urge presidential party conventions to adopt woman suffrage planks in party platforms and 19 campaigns with 19 successive Congresses. It was a continuous, seemingly endless chain of activity. Young suffragists, who helped to forge the last links of that chain were not born when it began. Old suffragists, who forged the first links, were dead when it came to an end.

At the beginning of the Century, there was probably no school of so-called “higher learning for girls” in the entire world. Certainly, there were none in the United States. The less privileged classes were totally illiterate. Convents, boarding schools, and Dame schools existed, but the curricula were limited to mere rudiments. In 1841, three girls had received degrees at Oberlin. By 1920, 30,000 girls had been graduated at colleges and at this time it is estimated that 372,914 women are attending colleges in this country or approximately 40% of all college students. The first women students were forced to hear ridicule and even insult from students, faculties, the press and the public, but by 1900, the modern college woman was attended, throughout her college life, with respect and honor, while a thoroughly converted public received the graduates, diplomas in hand, with a hospitable welcome.

In the beginning, women found all the laws concerned males and females. The advanced schools and even the first colleges were female institutions. Those interested did not like these words as they sounded too much like animals in the zoo. For a time, gentlemen and ladies replaced male and female, before men and women finally came. I recall hearing a man say in a speech: “I have visited a factory where ladies were making overalls for gentlemen.” Thus women were promoted in that century from females to ladies, from ladies to women [and from women to people.*]

The Century opened with the first school for higher learning for girls. It closed with the declaration of the Secretary of State that all women were enfranchised. At the beginning, the list of women’s wrongs was so overwhelming that an estimate of the time necessary for their correction might have been one thousand years. These changes were achieved in a hundred. The explanation of the shorter times is that men were never as dictatorial as the law and women had higher aspirations than the world knew.

All that The Woman’s Century achieved, the women, who were its propulsive force, bequeath to you. I think they would like me to add one reminder. All the workers in that Century labored with a common motive. Worded by Mary Wollstonecraft this was: “Women should advance and not retard progress.” For myself, let me say that those who work for a great cause receive comforting satisfaction in the knowledge that they will leave the world better than they found it.



About all that a commencement orator can do for his auditors is to turn their faces around. He looks back upon the world as he thinks it was. Then he considers the world as he thinks it is. Finally in his receding perspective he discloses the pictured phantasm which he hopes will be the future. Thereupon his young listeners may see mirrored in the gloss of his picture the world which they think they will make. It is a pleasant exercise.

 
This commencement oratory which floods our land every June may be an effective anesthetic which youth may take at its second birth, out of the solid, unyielding, factual environment of childhood and of books, out of the substantial fabric of the curriculum with its sure reward of grade, class standing, and satisfying compensation into the bewildering, hazy, and altogether ironic mockeries that we call, in humorous euphony, real life.
 
I stand here tiptoeing near the end of my three score years and ten. There you sit across an abysm scarcely fifty feet wide but deeper than the distance to the moon. I come out of one dream world that is memory. You go into a visionary world that is hope. I tell you of the things that I imagine are true in my world. You hold in your hearts the picture of your world that shall be. We dwell on these two different planets. How can I hope to get across the chasm of time and space any hint, even a flickering shadow of my truth that will reach your hearts? For my world seemed to be a static world when I stood fifty years ago where you stand now. My forebears since Caesar’s day had not greatly changed the tools with which they made their clothes, got their goods, built their houses; nor had they changed greatly in those twenty centuries the philosophy upon which they erected their future. Today you look back upon a world that has moved so far in one hundred years that nothing you see and feel, touch and taste, hope, believe, and love is as it was when your grandfathers learned from their grandfathers how to live in another day. So what may have some bearing, though heaven only knows what, upon you lives. Perhaps I can tell you something, and being called here, I shall try…
 
We know we have not done God’s work perfectly. The world we have made out of the inheritance of our grandfathers is a pretty sad botch. It is full of gross injustices. Obviously a couple of centuries of hard work needs to be done on it before America is turned out, finished in its millennial beauty. But with all these inequities, the old thing does hold together. We turn our country over to you in one piece - which is something. Even if it isn’t a pretty piece, it is yours, with its spiritual hereditaments. And may I be pardoned the vanity of one who worked on the job if I try to give you some idea of what has held this nation in unity during a century and a half when in many other parts of the globe races and tongues and economic units have been breaking into small states, magnifying nationalism into a vice.
 
Today, as never before, nationalism in small geographical areas is pulling men into bitter disunion and controversy. Some flame of envy and rancor is abroad in the world. We see it moving across the face of Europe in various tyrannies, each exalting its own nationalism, each challenging liberty in its own way - Italy under fascism, Germany under the Nazis, Russia under communism, Spain boiling with confusion, while the two principles of dictatorship, that of the plutocracy and that of the proletariat, struggle for possession of that brave land. These isms are types of one pestilence which is threatening civilization. That this spiritual pestilence will attack America, no one can doubt.
 
How can we Americans immunize ourselves? The class of ‘37 must find out why small geographical, social racial units are erupting into a virulent nationalism that threatens western civilization. It’s your problem, esteemed descendants, but here’s a hint that might help you to solve it.
 
I am satisfied that the disease has its root in a lack of social faith. The thing that has bound America into one nation is tolerance - tolerance and patience; indeed, tolerance and patience upheld by a sense of duty.
 
At this point, dearly beloved members of the class of ‘37, I propose to reveal the screw loose in my mental processes, also to show you something of the aberration of your forebears. You have this dementia in you blood, and you might as well know it. Your fathers, mothers, and remote ancestors for several thousand years believed in the reality of duty. Upon that madness they built the world. Not that I wish to brag about it - this sense of duty - but I still hug the delirium of my generation to my heart and believe there is something in those old-fashioned eccentricities known as the Christian virtues.
 
Don’t get excited. I am not preaching piety. I have no plan of salvation to offer you, no theology to defend. But I feel, and my generation has believed in a general way, that democracy with its freedom, with its patience, with its tolerance, with its altruism, is a sort of rough attempt to institutionalize the Christian philosophy. And when I say rough, I mean rough, something like a 20 percent realization of a noble ideal.
 
Our American Constitution, for instance, is a national compact of our individual and of our social duties. It has worked in this country after a fashion. Yet the same Constitution, or nearly the same, has been adopted in a dozen other lands and has failed. Why has it held us to an essential unity? I am satisfied that our Constitution has stood up because Americans actually have established here a sort of code of duties. That has been the crystallizing principle that has held us together - duty of man to man, of region to region, of class to class, of race to race, of faith to faith. That duty has bred something more than neighborly tolerance. It has engendered a profound desire in very American’s heart to make life as pleasant as it may be made - not merely for himself, indeed not chiefly for himself, but for others. Thus we have found and cherished true liberty.
 
Liberty if it shall cement man into political unity, must be something more than a man’s conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that the rights of others must be maintained. Only when a people have this love of liberty, this militant belief in the sacredness of another man’s self respect, do races and nations posses the catalyzer in their political and social organism which produces the chemical miracle of crystallized national unity and strength.
 
We Americans have had it for three hundred years on this continent. It was in the blood of our fathers. It was the basis of our faith in humanity when we wrote our Constitution. It has been with us a long time on this continent - this capacity for compromise, this practical passion for social justice and for altruistic equity in settling the genuine differences of men. This high quality of mutual respect is no slight gift. It is a heroic spiritual endowment, this knack of getting along together on a continental scale.
 
We have set as a national custom the habit of majority rule. This custom is maintained not by arms but by a saving sense in the heart of every minority that any majority will not be puffed up, will not infringe upon the rights of the minority. Matching this duty of the majority to be fair, we have set up the component duty of the minority to be patient, but to agitate until the justice of a losing cause has convinced the winning majority. This American tradition of political adjustment cuts through every line of cleavage and all difference in our social organization - regions, classes, races, creed. Here is the way it has worked.
 
As our country has expanded geographically, this political genius for unity has tapped our store of certain basic virtues: neighborly forbearance, meekness, unselfishness, and that belief in the essential decency of don’ts, neighbors which, for want of a better word, we have called love. Now, in our land abideth these three: faith in our fellows, hope in the triumph of reason, and love for humanity. With all the grievous faults and glaring weaknesses of our federal union, these things are the centripetal spiritual forces which have solidified America.
 
These commonsense qualities which have grown out of the Beatitudes have helped to preserve the American Union for the last century and a half. Now what are you going to do about it, you who stand here at the threshold of the reality of your past, looking into the evanescent horizon of your future?
 
We who shall soon be petrified into pedestaled ghosts as your ancestors have a notion that you, our descendants, don’t have much use for duty, for patience, and for tolerance. We get the general idea that you have no sort of faith in the strength of the humble. Yet it is out of this lack of faith that a new challenge has appeared in the world, a challenge aimed at democracy, a challenge which scorns these lowly neighborly virtues that have held our world together. This challenge is finding its way into our American life. We are being told that the majority sometimes has emergency mandates to ignore the rights of the minorities. We have set up rulers all over earth who preach against the virtue of patience. It is a new thing in our America to hear men defending the tyrannies of Europe - communism, fascism, and the Nazis - declaring that the minority is right. It is even a stranger doctrine in America, which holds that a passing majority, by reason of its being a ballot box majority at one or two elections, has an inherent right immediately to suppress and ruthlessly destroy an honest minority.
 
Now, as an ancestor, let me caution you, my heirs and assigns, that these new political attitudes are symptoms of greed for power. They will fool you if you channel your thinking into narrow dialectics. Don’t take your logical premise from your class self-interest. Don’t build your logic upon a purely selfish structure. Don’t think as plutocrats. Don’t reason as members of the middle class or as proletarians. Such thinking is too sure of its own syllogisms ever to be just. Such thinking rejects the possibility that there is truth and that there may be reason in the contention of another class of society. This same discord that has torn as under so many peoples in Europe, where fifty years ago democracy seemed to be taking root, today is seeding in our land.
 
Capitalists are scoring labor leaders. Labor leaders are preaching distrust and hatred for capitalists. The revelations of the La Follette committee in the United States Senate now investigating the infringement of civil liberties certainly lay bare the cancer of hatred in our economic body that is poisoning our national blood. The class-conscious arrogance of wealth is creating its own class morals. Proletarian logic is justifying the use of force in class conflict and condoning cunning. The industrial enterpriser shuts his eyes to the tragedy of the farmer’s economic plight. Then the farmer envies the financier.
 
But I feel sure the tide will turn. You who stand here, chisel in hand, about to hew out the future, have something in you; humanity’s most precious mental gift - the eternal resilience, the everlasting bounce in man. You may love for the moment the indolent sense of futility that comes with the grand cynicism of youth. But life, experience, the hazards of your day, and time will bring out of you the courage bred into you. You will find that you have the urge that we had. You will want to believe in something in spite of yourselves. You will want to construct something. For you are the sons and daughters of a creative people, inventive, resourceful, daring. And above all, in spite of the many unpleasant things you have learned in this cloister, in spite of the hard realties that have molded your youth, you are mystics, you are crusaders, you are incorrigible visionaries in the noblest sense of these words. The eternal verities of your inheritance, the organizing brains, the industry, the noble purpose that during the nineteenth century made America a kindlier and more beautiful land than ever before was brought forth on this planet, will be beckoning you, urging you, indeed, sternly commanding you to follow whatever is fine and just in the achievement of your country.
 
The residuum of what I am trying to say is this: You must reorganize life in your America and point your achievement toward a fairer distributive system. Abundance is here for the taking. don’t bemoan your lost frontier. It is even now flashing on our horizon. A gorgeous land lies before you fair and more beautiful than man before has ever known. Out of the laboratory will come new processes to multiply material things for your America, to multiply them almost infinitely; but only if you will hold open the channels of free science, unfettered thought, and the right of a man to use his talents to the utmost provided he gives honest social returns for the rewards he takes.
 
Don’t delude yourselves about your new frontier. For on that frontier which will rise over the laboratories you will find the same struggle, the same hardships, the same inequities that your forefathers have found on every frontier since the beginning of time. You will find rapacious men trying to grab more than their share of the common bounties of the new frontier. You will find human greeds and human perfidies there as we found them fifty years ago and as our fathers found them generations upon generations before. Energetic buccaneers always thrive wherever men are pioneering. In every one of the ten long generations during which your ancestors have been conquering this continent and building a proud civilization here, they have struggled as you will struggle against the injustices of life which are bred out of the lust for power in unsocial men. But don’t let that discourage you…
 
And now, in closing, on behalf of your fathers who are bequeathing to you their choicest gifts, let me say that your heritage is not in these great lovely cities, not this wide and fertile land, not the mountains full of undreamed of riches. These you may find in other continents. What we leave you that is precious are the few simple virtues which have stood us in good stead in the struggle of our generation. We will and bequeath to you our enthusiasm, our diligence, our zeal for a better world, that were the lode stars of our fathers. As our legatees we assign you our tolerance, our patience, our kindness, our faith, hope, and love, which make for the self-respect of man. These qualities of heart and mind grow out of a conviction that the democratic philosophy as mode of thinking will lead mankind into a nobler way of life.

We who are met here together in the midst of life, no matter how much joy and confidence we may have in the future must, nevertheless, be prepared to face death. Not one of us can be immune.

I am thinking of a boy. He was such a fine boy, that boy who is now dead. He was a close friend of mine for eight years. Two years ago when he graduated from high school, he came to tell me how much opposed he was to the United States getting into the war. He was a pacifist, almost of the Quaker type, and the dignity of the individual, regardless of race, creed or color, meant everything to him. But he was strong physically, an excellent football player, and a good wrestler, and he had a complete disdain for physical fear. We talked. He said that we Americans were suckers to get into World War No. 1, that it was not our obligation to get involved twice in a European mess.

I told him I disagreed with him, and why. After sketching out for him Germany's five wars of aggression during the past 80 years, I told him that before we could start to work on the kind of world he wanted, it would be necessary to use force to destroy the power of the aggressor nations Ð to destroy their power so completely as to make it impossible for them to break the peace again.

George remained a pacifist in his heart, but he became a convert to the necessity of using physical force to fight this particular evil. He was in his second year at Quaker College when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor. He at once determined to put his strong body and alert mind at the disposition of his government in one of the most dangerous services possible. He wanted to become a dive-bomber in the Marines. A month ago he had a day off in Washington. He has just gotten his wings and the Marines had accepted him for dive bombing duty. I talked with him and his fiancée. They desperately wanted to get married. He still hated war with an ardent hatred. He spoke of the technical difficulties of dive bombing, of how difficult it was to get close enough to hit the mark and yet pull out of the dive fast enough to avoid destruction of the plane. He was leaving that night for Florida to take his last six weeks of training preparatory to getting into active fighting.

Two weeks ago there came from Florida the telegram announcing his death. He and another boy were on a routine "oxygen hop," diving from 20,000 feet altitude; just what happened is not clear, but in any event they never pulled out of the dive. Two weeks ago today I was with George's parents and with the girl he was to have married. She had received a letter from him written on Wednesday of that week, telling about the flight, which he was to take on Thursday, and how confident he was of a successful result. The father reminded me that two years previously I had given the boy my photograph with the inscription, "For George, with hope for the future."

Then, I remembered that when I convinced the boy of the necessity of eliminating Nazism as a preliminary to building a world of peace, he had been pessimistic about the ability and willingness of the older generation in the United States to measure up to its responsibility.

He never doubted that he and his comrades would defeat the Nazis and the Japs. He had no reservations whatsoever about doing first things first. He was utterly resolved to give his all to make sure of the first part of the program. But with regard to winning the peace, he was less optimistic. The last week he was home he said: "It's all baloney to talk about this younger generation winning the peace. We won't come to power for 20 years. The same generation that got us into this mess has got to get us out of it. What really matters is not what new thoughts we kids are thinking but what new thoughts you older guys are thinking. You'll be writing the ticket."

George is one of the millions of fine young men who have been killed as a result of war. Many of you have your George. He may be a son, a brother, a sweetheart or husband, or a boy from the neighborhood. He may be living, he may be dead. The chances are he hates war just as my George did. He hates the necessity of hating in order to do his part toward winning for himself and the world the privilege of life and love.

George had supreme confidence in his generation, but less in my generation. He looked on many of the public men of our time as incipient appeasers. He considered them small-minded and shortsighted. He argued that they were easily frightened by pressure groups, that they were lost in the trees of the political forest, and that they were unlikely to rise to the challenge of the fundamental verities when brought face to face with the job of rebuilding a shattered world. In a letter written shortly before he was killed, George said: "it's after the war that the real fight will start. Plenty of people who couldn't change fast enough to prevent this war still sit in the seats of the mighty. Never forget that they'll be a lot stronger when this is over than they are now. That's the time when we who are doing the fighting will need some real leadership. This war is our job and we are going to win it on the battlefronts, come hell or high water. The really tough job is going to begin after the war when the same forces that got us into this one will be pitted against the men who've got the guts to fight for a world in which everybody can have a chance to do useful work. We kids are depending on you older guys not to let this thing happen again. What we're fighting for now must not die in an armistice."

Through George's meteoric life and symbolic death, I was forced into a more complete appreciation of the meaning of the death of Christ to his disciples. Something bright and shining and full of hope had passed from the world. It just couldn't be. Death couldn't be. Death couldn't end all. Christ must live. He must live in the world forever. Somewhere there must be a perpetual good will. And now I conclude this vivid personal experience by saying: May it so be that my George, your George, and all those who have sacrificed their lives will so inspire us to effective action that they will not have died in vain. May many George's live to hold my generation to account in building the peace. And to build upon that peace in such a way that the George's of 30 years hence will treat, with reverence and love, the sacred values bought for them by death. May your children and my grandchildren be there greeting each new day in joy, confidence and creative endeavor.

George was right when he said that my generation would have the immediate responsibility for building the right kind of peace. But, as the years go on, that responsibility will pass to those who are young people now, to those who are in the armed services, to those who are graduating from college this year. No matter how wise the patterns of the peace set by the older generation, action within this framework will be the increasing responsibility of the younger
generation. Day-to-day and month-to-month modifications will be necessary to make the peace a live and dynamic contribution to human welfare.

The individual graduates of this particular college sitting before me on this June morning has perhaps a hundred graduating companions in the United States this spring. It has cost not merely many thousands of dollars, but infinitude of loving care to bring you to this stage of life. Only one out of 12 of our American boys and girls are given the privilege of graduating from college. Much will be expected from those to whom much as been given. In an astonishingly short time many of you will begin to have influence in your respective communities. On you will fall the heavy burden of the day-to-day job of maintaining a just peace; ten or twenty years from now when the memories of this vile war have faded and new and difficult economic problems have arisen.

Maintaining a peace is like keeping a garden in good order. You have to work at it day in and day out, otherwise the rains wash away the soil, and the weeds get so deeply rooted that it is impossible to pull them out without destroying many good plants as well.If we are not to break faith with the boys who have died, we must invent better machinery for weeding the world garden. First, and above everything else, we must have an intense desire to make this machinery succeed. We can then work out the details of disarming aggressor nations, of preventing the exploitation of small, weak nations, and of seeing to it in the future that no aggressor nation can start on the path which leads to breading the peace of the world.

We must appeal to the Axis youth, especially German youth, and if possible get their cooperation. The task of all the peace-loving peoples will be to build into the next generation the knowledge and character required to maintain a just and lasting peace.

The present false attitude of the German people toward war finds its roots in the Prussian school system and especially in the type of militaristic education that became more prevalent as a reaction to defeat by Napoleon. The Danish educator, Grundtvig, writing in 1838, predicted that German education would finally kill the Germans. He pointed out that following Napoleonic wars the German schools, which he called schools of death, had been teaching the youth to believe that the Germans were better than anyone else, that the rest of the
world existed to serve them and be dominated by them, and that their will should be imposed on the rest of the world by force.

When the education of youth goes wrong, sooner or later all goes wrong. There had existed in Germany a fine, liberal tradition. There had lived men like Luther with his emphasis on freedom, Cant with his message on peace, Goethe with his belief in international understanding and cooperation, and Beethoven, whom early in the Napoleonic wars thought a new day of liberty was being born. Out of
the culture fostered by these men, and many others like them, came Carl Schurz and the other German liberals of that era who contributed so vitally to the building of many progressive communities in the Middle West of the United States. Not all the liberal Germans left Germany, but those who remained - they, their children and their grandchildren - were subject to the increasing tyrannies of Bismarck and Hitler.

I believe that in the prevention of World War No. 3 - in keeping faith with the boys who have given their lives - much will depend on just how we handle the German youth immediately following this war. I think of the experience of a man who today is a professor in one of our American universities but who in World War No. 1, as a boy of 17, had spent just a few months in the German army when peace came. With thousands of other German boys, he immediately set out to
finish his education. He described to me a few days ago how most of the German students, in the winter of 1918-19 and the years that followed, felt liberated from the terror of war and from the routine of army life. They were hungry for spiritual food. Living on the poorest quality of black bread, eating in soup kitchens, and studying at night in cold rooms, they were bound together by hardships but buoyed up by the faith that they would rebuild themselves through books toward spiritual understanding and a new order - a democratic order - They knew that Germans had lost in the external world, but they dreamed of creating a rich internal world to replace the loss. They eagerly hoped for a lasting peace. They demonstrated this at Munich in 1921, when they gave a tumultuous welcome to the Indian poet. Rabindranath Tagore.

But, according to my German professor friend, the allied powers had no interest in the glorious hopes among the German University youth of that day. The allies provided no incentive for education in democratic traditions. And so the German youth fell into the hands of retired army generals, monarchist professors, and politicians. Thus the way was prepared for Hitler and Goebbels to return German education to the teaching of racial superiority, war, and death. We must not repeat the mistakes made by the Allies after World War One. 

This time we must see that the defeat of Germany is complete. The Germans themselves will probably wreak vengeance on their Nazi overlords. In any event, we must see that the guilty are punished. And we must not again fail the German young people who, in the depth of their material hunger and misery, will have a great philosophic and spiritual hunger. That these strong and despairing emotions may be guided toward a good end is a matter of supreme importance for the world.

The German postwar youth of World War Two need not be forced to embrace either communism, a new type of totalitarianism, or even the particular type of democracy which we have in the United States. We shall not need to send school teachers from the United States into the German schools, but we can make sure that the liberal element in Germany has an opportunity to replace the Nazi school books and the Nazi methods of teaching.

I am a great believer in the Danish fold high school and the Scandinavian systems of cooperation. I believe they are well adapted to the German situation, once militarism and totalitarianism are stamped out. A considerable segment of the German people has long admired the emphasis placed on peace, cooperation and fruitful work by the various Scandinavian countries. The German youth must be encouraged to develop a peaceful, worthwhile purpose in life. I believe there are Germans who are steeped in the German liberal tradition and the ideals of Scandinavian cooperation, to whom this job can be safely entrusted. Not only in Germany, but also in our own and other countries the type of education which prevails may well determine whether we succeed in building a world of law and order and productive work. Our educational system has many splendid achievements to its credit, and it can be even more fully adapted to the needs of modern, highly integrated society.

Working for peace and the general welfare is the essence of all true education and all true religion. It is the Sermon on the Mount in action. All the schools in the world will have to be reborn after this great conflict, if the boys who have died are not to have died in vain. In the years to come it will be even more important for the schools to teach character than to teach facts. In the teaching of character, the essential thing will be the ability of the teacher to kindle enthusiasm for knowledge, but especially enthusiasm for the greater good. There is something about the spoken work of the person who is deeply moved inside which carries great conviction. Neither the book nor the radio can even take the place of the face-to-face contact with the living teacher. May the emphasis on system never stamp out of our schools the personal equation —the communication, by friendship and the power of the spoken word, of a boundless enthusiasm for all the facts of nature and human life which mead to peace and vital living. May the vision of a new and finer and more orderly world animate the teachers of every country. In their hands is the hope of the future. Many of the teachers will of course continue to be women. In the building of character and the communication of enthusiasm, the majority of women throughout history have demonstrated a unique capacity. In the field of original investigation and in administrative positions they have not been as prominent as men. While I am sure that many women have excellent executive ability, yet I can not help thinking that their greatest contribution for many generations to come will result from their capacity to stimulate the best in others. The kindling of
inspiration is an art rather than a science. The ultimate function of most women's minds is to synthesize rather than to analyze, to build up rather than to tear down. Doubtless the women's colleges will continue the trend of recent years in the direction of enabling their graduates to realize most effectively that which they are by nature - women capable of communicating enthusiasm and building
character. Any may this all be for the purpose of insuring harmonious living together on every level of existence - in the family, in the nation, and in the family of nations. If the women of the world really make their influence felt, war will surely be outlawed and stay outlawed.

And in the hands of everyone who is going out into the work of the world - whatever it may be - is the responsibility for keeping faith with those who have died. This is the true commencement, which has come for you here, this June Sabbath day. Commencement time will come to the world when the armies stop marching, when the men return to the factories and fields, and when the statesmen get down to planning in real earnest. Commencement time is a sudden break with the past. It is a new opportunity. There may be disillusionment or fulfillment.

After the First World War many boys came home from overseas, looking for the better conditions that would justify the lives that had been silent. Instead, they found prices skyrocketing and a national fever for making money. There was a sad lack of planning on the part of the statesmen of both parties. Neither domestic nor foreign policies were well thought out. Thousands of these boys were lured into the speculative excitement and were ruined. All of our people have paid a bitter price in the suffering that has followed.

As a nation we decided we were not ready to take on adult responsibilities after World War No. I. We weren't ready even to graduate from high school, and some of us wanted to go back to the eighth grade. Now, whether we like it or not, we must get out into the world and work. The easy days of sheltered isolation are over. We have grown up. We must live day after day with the family of nations, furnishing our share of leadership, even though we are reluctant to do it. Our feeling of responsibility must match our economic power, or the mere fact of that economic power will rot us inside and make us a prey either or internal revolutionary forces of external aggression.

Yes, commencement time is here. Responsibility has begun. Life has come upon us. The joys of opportunity and service lie ahead. No generation has ever had such an opportunity. The world has never had such an opportunity. We must make the dead live. We must make them live in the world's commencement of abiding peace based on justice and charity. 

I'm profoundly grateful and touched by the great distinction and honor and great compliment accorded me by the authorities of Harvard this morning. I'm overwhelmed, as a matter of fact, and I'm rather fearful of my inability to maintain such a high rating as you've been generous enough to accord to me. In these historic and lovely surroundings, this perfect day, and this very wonderful assembly, it is a tremendously impressive thing to an individual in my position. But to speak more seriously, I need not tell you, gentlemen, that the world situation is very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people. I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. Furthermore, the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of the earth and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the long-suffering peoples, and the effect of those reactions on their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace in the world.

In considering the requirements for the rehabilitation of Europe, the physical loss of life, the visible destruction of cities, factories, mines and railroads was correctly estimated but it has become obvious during recent months that this visible destruction was probably less serious than the dislocation of the entire fabric of European economy. For the past 10 years conditions have been highly abnormal. The feverish preparation for war and the more feverish maintenance of the war effort engulfed all aspects of national economies. Machinery has fallen into disrepair or is entirely obsolete. Under the arbitrary and destructive Nazi rule, virtually every possible enterprise was geared into the German war machine. Long-standing commercial ties, private institutions, banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies disappeared, through loss of capital, absorption through nationalization, or by simple destruction. In many countries, confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken. The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete. Recovery has been seriously retarded by the fact that two years after the close of hostilities a peace settlement with Germany and Austria has not been agreed upon. But even given a more prompt solution of these difficult problems the rehabilitation of the economic structure of Europe quite evidently will require a much longer time and greater effort than had been foreseens

There is a phase of this matter which is both interesting and serious. The farmer has always produced the foodstuffs to exchange with the city dweller for the other necessities of life. This division of labor is the basis of modern civilization. At the present time it is threatened with breakdown. The town and city industries are not producing adequate goods to exchange with the food producing farmer. Raw materials and fuel are in short supply. Machinery is lacking or worn out. The farmer or the peasant cannot find the goods for sale which he desires to purchase. So the sale of his farm produce for money which he cannot use seems to him an unprofitable transaction. He, therefore, has withdrawn many fields from crop cultivation and is using them for grazing. He feeds more grain to stock and finds for himself and his family an ample supply of food, however short he may be on clothing and the other ordinary gadgets of civilization. Meanwhile people in the cities are short of food and fuel. So the governments are forced to use their foreign money and credits to procure these necessities abroad. This process exhausts funds which are urgently needed for reconstruction. Thus a very serious situation is rapidly developing which bodes no good for the world. The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.

The truth of the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products - principally from America - are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character.

The remedy lies in breaking the vicious circle and restoring the confidence of the European people in the economic future of their own countries and of Europe as a whole. The manufacturer and the farmer throughout wide areas must be able and willing to exchange their products for currencies the continuing value of which is not open to question.

Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist. Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any assistance that this Government may render in the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find full co-operation I am sure, on the part of the United States Government. Any government which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us. Furthermore, governments, political parties, or groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in order to profit therefrom politically or otherwise will encounter the opposition of the United States.

It is already evident that, before the United States Government can proceed much further in its efforts to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to the requirements of the situation and the part those countries themselves will take in order to give proper effect to whatever action might be undertaken by this Government. It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so. The program should be a joint one, agreed to by a number, if not all European nations.

An essential part of any successful action on the part of the United States is an understanding on the part of the people of America of the character of the problem and the remedies to be applied. Political passion and prejudice should have no part. With foresight, and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country, the difficulties I have outlined can and will be overcome.

I am sorry that on each occasion I have said something publicly in regard to our international situation, I've been forced by the necessities of the case to enter into rather technical discussions. But to my mind, it is of vast importance that our people reach some general understanding of what the complications really are, rather than react from a passion or a prejudice or an emotion of the moment. As I said more formally a moment ago, we are remote from the scene of these troubles. It is virtually impossible at this distance merely by reading, or listening, or even seeing photographs or motion pictures, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation. And yet the whole world of the future hangs on a proper judgment. It hangs, I think, to a large extent on the realization of the American people, of just what are the various dominant factors. What are the reactions of the people? What are the justifications of those reactions? What are the sufferings? What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?

Thank you very much.

Commencement speakers, by tradition, scan the future. They strive to predict, in general terms at least, the sort of success that awaits the graduates who properly apply themselves to their jobs and professions--and, of course, follow the advice of the speaker!

But the man who spoke at my commencement did not hint that I should be the first in a half century to receive an honorary degree here. Certainly I could not foresee, by the widest stretch of imagination, that one day the faculty and trustees of this University should consider me worthy of honorary membership in the Class of 1955 at Pennsylvania State--the Centennial Class of this most distinguished school. I am grateful for this honor and delighted by my association with this class. I am particularly grateful that my youngest brother--younger brothers being confirmed skeptics about their elders--raised no objection and in person made the presentation.

Earlier this week I joined in reunion with my own Class of 1915 at West Point. Most of us had grown gray and some of us more than a little bald; but these changes were slightly compensated, I thought, by an appearance of wisdom that we did not possess forty years ago. I am sure we all felt privileged, greatly privileged, to have lived in a day of marvels and of tremendous growth in America's stature. Although we were silent about it, I am certain that every one of us envied the men in the Class of 1955 as much for the opportunities and discoveries ahead of them as for their youth, their boundless energy, and their idealism. And in this feeling I am doubtless joined by thousands of alumni here as they applaud and congratulate you of this Class of 1955.

Of course, you men and women venture forth into a world where human nature differs little, if at all, from human nature in 1915 or in the Age of Pericles. Human relations--the art of getting along with the people who work beside you and with those who live thousands of miles away--does not change in its essence with the centuries. But the age of nuclear energy, in its industrial and economic aspects, will likely bear no more resemblance to the age of steam than a jet-powered plane to an old-fashioned box kite. Indeed, the social pattern of living may be transformed beyond recognition, for I think it can be stated almost as an axiom, demonstrated by the history of mankind that:

Out of the use of a new and great energy source, along with boundless opportunities, come new and great human problems that require new and great solutions produced by broadly informed, wisely sympathetic, spiritually inspired minds.

On this campus this morning, I had the privilege of inspecting the first atomic reactor of its kind established under university auspices. This research facility was made possible by the foresight of the trustees of this University who financed the structure and its operation. The Atomic Energy Commission provides only the fuel. In consequence, within several weeks, the atom will be at productive work here at Penn State. Here also the economic and human problems created by this new energy will be simultaneously studied by the distinguished faculties of this institution of learning.

Nuclear energy is too new for any man to chart its limits or predict its course with accuracy. But in ten short years the curtain has been pushed aside sufficiently to afford glimpses that have aroused atomic hopes commensurate with the awful dimension of atomic fears.

The extent of the economic and industrial changes that we can anticipate is indicated by estimates that world sources of uranium potentially available contain as high as twenty times the energy of the known world reserves of coal, petroleum, and natural gas combined. But power is only one of the results of nuclear fission. Many engineers and scientists believe that radiation and radioactive isotopes may provide even greater peacetime benefit. They are already opening new horizons in medicine, agriculture, and industrial processes.

Our Nation has no desire for a monopoly on the knowledge and practice of these possibilities. We want the world to share-as we always have.

Moreover, we know that the human talents essential to the advancement of science are not restricted to this country. Throughout the free countries there are men and women of great ability who, given the opportunity, can help further to advance the frontiers of knowledge and contribute to the peace and progress of the peoples of all nations.

Progress to date in nuclear science is not, of course, exclusively an American achievement. An international cooperative effort broke the barriers and made possible man's use of atomic energy. For maximum progress in the future, we must work for a continued partnership between the world's best minds--in science, engineering, education, business, and the professions.

In recognition of these facts, I proposed before the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1953, that Governments begin then and continue to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of fissionable materials to an International Atomic Agency. Although a year later, the United Nations adopted the resolution recommending the formation of such an international agency, the Soviet Union has indicated no willingness to share any part of its nuclear stockpile with such an agency. Our offer still stands.
But we cannot wait on Soviet decisions.

Already we have made substantial progress under Congressional authority toward agreements with friendly foreign governments for participation with us in the task of forwarding peaceful atomic progress. Agreements with Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Colombia, Brazil, and the Argentine Republic have been initialed. Others are being negotiated. Now we move in further action.

We have developed two new programs that I shall submit to the Congress in the conviction that they reflect the spirit and intent of law and of the American people.

First: we propose to offer research reactors to the people of free nations who can use them effectively for the acquisition of the skills and understanding essential to peaceful atomic progress. The United States, in the spirit of partnership that moves us, will contribute half the cost. We will also furnish the acquiring nation the nuclear material needed to fuel the reactor.

Second: within prudent security considerations, we propose to make available to the peoples of such friendly nations as are prepared to invest their own funds in power reactors, access to and training in the technological processes of construction and operation for peaceful purposes.

If the technical and material resources of a single nation should not appear adequate to make effective use of a research reactor, we would support a voluntary grouping of the resources of several nations within a single region to acquire and operate it together.

Our purpose is to spark the creative and inventive skills latent in the free world, to pool them and to put them to work for the betterment of the conditions under which men must live.

The research reactors acquired under this program will be fertile seeds for progress sown in the receptive soil of the free nations. The cost to the people of the United States will be small indeed when measured against the certain returns, tangible and intangible.

The second proposal will be of immediate interest mainly to the power-short areas of the world where atomic power may be economically feasible even today. Some of the countries, however, lack the knowledge and experience needed to construct and operate a commercial power reactor. This we can share for constructive purposes with friendly countries without real risk to our national security. Such sharing is expressly contemplated by the new Atomic Energy Act.

Together, these two provisions are designed, within the limits of prudence, to clear away some of the obstacles that have impeded progress in nuclear science and to permit its peaceful application by all who propose to make it serve mankind. Here is an invitation--to scientists and engineers, to industries and governments--to pool their energies and creative talents that this great achievement of the human mind may bear the fruit of its infinite promise.

The people of the United States instinctively reject any thought that their greatest scientific achievement can be used only as a weapon. Our increasing progress in its peaceful applications is evidence of that fact.

While we build atomic-powered ships for war--because we must--we have the desire, the determination to build atomic-powered ships for peace. And build them we shall! The first atomic-powered merchant ship, at its ports of call, will be a laboratory demonstration that man can harness this unlimited energy for normal, peaceful, prosperous life.

While we design bombs that can obliterate great military objectives-because we must--we are also designing generators, channels and reservoirs of atomic energy so that man may profit from this gift which the Creator of all things has put into his hands. And build them we shall!

The two proposals I have outlined here are the gateway to a broad avenue of world progress in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Surely those of the Russian people--who, despite their Communist overlords, still think for themselves and who still retain respect for human dignity--are moved by the same feelings as we.

I still hope earnestly that the Soviet Union may join in an international effort to harness the atom for man's good. But I have such unlimited confidence in the creativeness of free minds and in the capacity of free men that I know we will, with or without the Soviets, achieve a more abundant life for those who join together in this historic venture.

As for the social and political problems that will accompany this development, their outlines can be foreseen but dimly. Their solution will be a task in which you men and women who graduate today will be engaged intensively, probably throughout your lives. Some questions immediately suggest themselves.

Will there prevail the deep desires shared by the vast majority of all people on the earth who want peaceful use of this and all other technical advancements? Can they defeat the designs of those few evil men who would use command of this energy for their control of human destiny? In this question are involved such vital alternatives as war and peace, armament and disarmament, death and life.

Another group of questions is of a somewhat different character. As nuclear and other technological achievements continue to mount, the normal life span will continue to climb. The hourly productivity of the worker will increase. How is the increase in leisure time and the extension in life expectancy to be spent? Will it be for the achievement of man's better aspirations or his degradation to the level of a well-fed, well-kept slave of an all-powerful state?

Indeed, merely to state that question sharply reminds us that in these days and in the years ahead the need for philosophers and theologians parallels the need for scientists and engineers.

These two questions merely hint at the enormous problems and possibilities that will confront your generation. Scores of others will present themselves in the changing picture in agriculture, industry, and the arts. The answers can be found only by broadly informed, wisely sympathetic, spiritually inspired minds, the product of general education that properly blends the practical and technical with the liberal and cultural.

In this country we emphasize both liberal and practical education. But too often it is a liberal education for one and a practical education for another. What we desperately need is an integrated liberal, practical education for the same person--for every American youth who can possibly obtain its blessings. Hand and head and heart were made to work together. They must work together. They should be educated together.

In colonial Philadelphia, there was a printer who was likewise a scientist and who was hailed the wisest man of his day--a builder of international understanding and friendship. In nineteenth century Illinois, there was a rail-splitter who was likewise a lawyer and who was hailed a champion of humanity--a builder of freedom for all men. Despite their lack of formal schooling, they were educated men. Education today can nurture for us the possibility of a thousand Franklins and a thousand Lincolns in a generation, where before we were fortunate to have one.

To gain proficiency, sometimes even world acclaim in a specialized skill or profession, knowledge and training are the principal requisites. But to understand how one skill fits into another, how one profession complements and depends on another, how all human enterprises constitute an immense, interdependent society--only education can develop that understanding.

In our modern higher education, we have, I believe, three principle difficulties. First, in its practical aspect, we simply are not providing it to sufficient numbers of young men and women.

Second, we are not as proficient as we should be in providing a broad citizenship education to those who specialize in the many technical fields.

And third, even in liberal education, we have permitted it to become too much a specialization, rather than a broad, liberating influence on the mind, the attitude, the character of all students.

What we need is general education, combining the liberal and the practical, which helps a student achieve the solid foundation of understanding--understanding of man's social institutions, of man's art and culture, and of the physical and biological and spiritual world in which he lives. It is an education which helps each individual learn how to relate one relevant fact to another; to get the total of relevant facts affecting a given situation in perspective; and to reason critically and with objectivity and moral conscience toward solutions to those situations or problems.

I repeat: this kind of education is sorely needed in this country--and throughout the world.

The peoples of this earth share today a great aspiration. They all have a common dream of lasting peace with freedom and justice. But the realization of the dream calls for many types of cooperation based upon sympathetic and thorough mutual understanding. In turn, such understanding is dependent on education that produces disciplined thinking.

Throughout the world, mutual suspicions flourish in ignorance and misunderstanding. They can be dispelled only with knowledge and wisdom.

If we are to have partners for peace, then we must first be partners in sympathetic recognition that all mankind possesses in common like aspirations and hungers, like ideals and appetites, like purposes and frailties, a like demand for economic advancement. The divisions between us are artificial and transient. Our common humanity is God-made and enduring.

I know that you who today complete your education at this great university in its centennial year recognize that truth. As you apply it to the problems you meet--as productive leaders, as American citizens, as members of the free world community-you will grow in personal stature and in your contribution to human peace, human independence, human advancement.

I'm sure you all must know the depth of my gratitude for this honor you have done me. What you can't know is how great is my feeling of unworthiness. For some 25 years I have nursed a feeling of guilt about the degree given me here upon the occasion of my own graduation. It was, I feel, more honorary than earned and for all these years I have carefully refrained from referring to myself as a "student" here. My very instinct is to mumble a modest "thanks" and sit down, but that retreat is denied me. Inherent in my invitation is the obligation to make some remarks appropriate to this occasion which shall climax your years of academic endeavor. I do not take this responsibility lightly. Realizing there are many present who are better qualified to perform this function, I have inquired right down to the start of the Processional as to an appropriate theme.

There was a temptation, of course, to beg your favor by citing the mistakes of my generation, dwelling on the awful state of the world and suggesting that you would bring order out of chaos and set things right. I'm not that pessimistic, however, and would be less than honest and sincere if I chose such a course. With your permission I would rather speak of something very close to my heart. You members of the graduating class of 1957 are today coming into your inheritance. You are taking your adult places in a society unique in the history of man's tribal relations. I would like to play the role of a "legal light" in the reading of the will, and to discuss with you the terms and conditions of your legacy.

Looming large in your inheritance is this country, this land America, placed as it is between two great oceans. Those who discovered and pioneered it had to have rare qualities of courage and imagination, nor did these qualities stop there. Even the modern-day immigrants have been possessed of courage beyond that of their neighbors. The courage to tear up centuries-old roots and leave their homelands, to come to this land where even the language was strange. Such courage is part of our inheritance, all of us spring from these special people and these qualities have contributed to the make-up of the American personality.

There are conditions to this "will" of which I speak. There are terms the heirs must meet in order to qualify for the legacy. But, I have never been able to believe that America is just a reward for those of extra courage and resourcefulness. This is a land of destiny and our forefathers found their way here by some Divine system of selective service gathered here to fulfill a mission to advance man a further step in his climb from the swamps.

Almost two centuries ago a group of disturbed men met in the small Pennsylvania State House [as] they gathered to decide on a course of action. Behind the locked and guarded doors they debated for hours whether or not to sign the Declaration which had been presented for their consideration. For hours the talk was treason and its price the headsman's axe, the gallows and noose. The talk went on and decision was not forthcoming. Then, Jefferson writes, a voice was heard coming from the balcony:

They may stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the land. They may turn every tree into a gallows, every home into a grave, and yet the words of that parchment can never die. They may pour our blood on a thousand scaffolds and yet from every drop that dyes the axe a new champion of freedom will spring into birth. The words of this declaration will live long after our bones are dust.

To the mechanic in his workshop they will speak hope; to the slave in the mines, freedom; but to the coward rulers, these words will speak in tones of warning they cannot help but hear. Sign that parchment. Sign if the next moment the noose is around your neck. Sign if the next minute this hall rings with the clash of falling axes! Sign by all your hopes in life or death, not only for yourselves but for all ages, for that parchment will be the textbook of freedom, the bible of the rights of man forever.

Were my soul trembling on the verge of eternity, my hand freezing in death, I would still implore you to remember this truth God has given America to be free.

As he finished, the speaker sank back in his seat exhausted. Inspired by his eloquence the delegates rushed forward to sign the Declaration of Independence. When they turned to thank the speaker for his timely words he couldn't be found and to this day no one knows who he was or how he entered or left the guarded room.

Here was the first challenge to the people of this new land, the charging of this nation with a responsibility to all mankind. And down through the years with but few lapses the people of America have fulfilled their destiny.

Almost a century and a half after that day in Philadelphia, this nation entered a great world conflict in Europe. Volumes of cynical words have been written about that war and our part in it. Our motives have been questioned and there has been talk of ulterior motives in high places, of world markets and balance of power. But all the words of all the cynics cannot erase the fact that millions of Americans sacrificed, fought and many died in the sincere and selfless belief that they were making the world safe for democracy and advancing the cause of freedom for all men.

A quarter of a century later America went into World War II, and never in the history of man had the issues of right and wrong been so clearly defined, so much so that it makes one question how anyone could have remained neutral. And again in the greatest mass undertaking the world has ever seen, America fulfilled her destiny.

A short time after that war was concluded a plane was winging its way across the Pacific Ocean. It contained dignitaries of the Philippines and of our own government. Landing at a naval installation a short distance from Manila, the plane was held there while those people listened by radio to the first detonation of an experimental atomic weapon at the Bikini Atoll. Then the plane took to the air again and soon landed in Manila. There these people, together with our vice president, senators, generals and admirals, met with 250,000 Philippines in the Grand Concourse, where they watched the American flag come down and the flag of the Philippine independence take its place.

I was privileged to sit in an auditorium one night and hear one of the passengers on that plane, a great man of the Philippines, describe this scene, General Carlos Romulo, whose father was killed by American soldiers in the Philippine insurrection. As a boy, the General was taught to be a guerrilla and to fight Americans and hate them. But I saw him, with tears in his eyes, tell us how he turned to his wife that day in Manila and said, "a hundred years from now will our children's children learn in their schoolrooms that on this day an atomic weapon was detonated for the first time on a Pacific Island, or will they learn that on another Pacific Island a great and powerful nation, which had bled the flower of its youth into the sands of the island's beaches reconquering them from a savage enemy, had on this day turned to the people of that island and for the first time in the history of man's relationship to man had said, 'Here, we've taken your country back for you. It's yours'." As we heard him, I think most of us realized once again the magnitude of the challenge of our destiny, that here indeed is "the last best hope of man on earth."

And now today we find ourselves involved in another struggle, this time called a cold war. This cold war between great sovereign nations isn't really a new struggle at all. It is the oldest struggle of human kind, as old as man himself. This is a simple struggle between those of us who believe that man has the dignity and sacred right and the ability to choose and shape his own destiny and those who do not so believe. This irreconcilable conflict is between those who believe in the sanctity of individual freedom and those who believe in the supremacy of the state.

In a phase of this struggle not widely known, some of us came toe to toe with this enemy this evil force in our own community in Hollywood, and make no mistake about it, this is an evil force. Don't be deceived because you are not hearing the sound of gunfire, because even so you are fighting for your lives. And you're fighting against the best organized and the most capable enemy of freedom and of right and decency that has ever been abroad in the world. Some years ago, back in the thirties, a man who was apparently just a technician came to Hollywood to take a job in our industry, an industry whose commerce is in tinsel and colored lights and make-believe. He went to work in the studios, and there were few to know he came to our town on direct orders from the Kremlin. When he quietly left our town a few years later the cells had been formed and planted in virtually all of our organizations, our guilds and unions. The framework for the Communist front organizations had been established.

It was some time later, under the guise of a jurisdictional strike involving a dispute between two unions, that we saw war come to Hollywood. Suddenly there were 5,000 tin-hatted, club-carrying pickets outside the studio gates. We saw some of our people caught by these hired henchmen; we saw them open car doors and put their arms across them and break them until they hung straight down the side of the car, and then these tin-hatted men would send our people on into the studio. We saw our so-called glamour girls, who certainly had to be conscious of what a scar on the face or a broken nose could mean careerwise going through those picket lines day after day without complaint. Nor did they falter when they found the bus which they used for transportation to and from work in flames from a bomb that had been thrown into it just before their arrival. Two blocks from the studio everyone would get down on hands and knees on the floor to avoid the bricks and stones coming through the windows. And the 5,000 pickets out there in their tin hats weren't even motion picture workers. They were maritime workers from the waterfront--members of Mr. Harry Bridges' union.

We won our fight in Hollywood, cleared them out after seven long months in which even homes were broken, months in which many of us carried arms that were granted us by the police, and in which policemen lived in our homes, guarding our children at night. And what of the quiet film technician who had left our town before the fighting started? Well, in 1951 he turned up on the Monterey Peninsula where he was involved in a union price-fixing conspiracy. Two years ago he appeared on the New York waterfront where he was Harry Bridges' right hand man in an attempt to establish a liaison between the New York and West Coast waterfront workers. And a few months ago he was mentioned in the speech of a U.S. Congresswoman who was thanking him for his help in framing labor legislation. He is a registered lobbyist in Washington for Harry Bridges.

Now that the first flush of victory is over we in Hollywood find ourselves blessed with a newly developed social awareness. We have allowed ourselves to become a sort of a village idiot on the fringe of the industrial scene, fair game for any demagogue or bigot who wants to stand up in the pulpit or platform and attack us. We are also fair game for those people, well-meaning though they may be, who believe that the answer to the world's ills is more government and more restraint and more regimentation. Suddenly we find that we are a group of second class citizens subject to discriminatory taxation, government interference and harassment.

This harassment reaches its peak, of course, in censorship. Here in this great land of the free, exchange of ideas in our section of the communications industry is subjected to political censorship in more than 200 cities and 11 states and it's spreading every day. But are we the only victims of these restraints and restrictions on our personal freedom? Is censorship really a restriction on us who already have a voluntary censorship code of good taste, or is this an invasion of your freedom? Isn't this the case of a few of your neighbors taking it upon themselves the right to tell you what you are capable of seeing and hearing on a motion picture screen?

So we worry a little about the class of '57, we who are older and have known another day. We worry that perhaps someday you might not resist as strongly as we would if someone decides to tell you what you can read in a newspaper, or hear on the radio, or hear from a speaker's platform, or what you can say or what you can think. So there are terms and conditions to the will, and one of the terms is your own eternal vigilance guarding against restrictions on our American freedom.

You today are smarter than we were. You are better educated and better informed than we were twenty-five years ago. And that is part of your heritage. You enjoy these added benefits because, more than 100 years ago near this very spot, a man plunged an ax into a tree and said, "here we will build a school for our children." And for over 100 years people have contributed to the endowment and support of this college. Their contributions were of the utmost in generosity because they could never know the handclasp of gratitude in return for their contributions. Their gifts were to generations yet unborn.

Many of us here share this heritage with you, and some of us shared it under different circumstances. I recall my own days on this campus in the depths of the depression. Even with study and reading I don't think you can quite understand what it was like to live in an America where the Illinois National Guard, with fixed bayonets, paraded down Michigan Avenue in Chicago as a warning to the more than half million unemployed men who slept every night in alleys and doorways under newspapers. On this campus many of us came who brought not one cent to help this school and pay for our education. The college, of course, had suffered and lost much of its endowment in the stock crash, had seen its revenue not only from endowment but from gifts curtailed because of the great financial chaos. But we heard none of that. We attended a college that made it possible for us to attend regardless of our lack of means, that created jobs for us, so that we could eat and sleep, and that allowed us to defer our tuition and trusted that they could get paid some day long after we had gone. And the professors, God bless them, on this campus, the most dedicated group of men and women whom I have ever known, went long months without drawing any pay. Sometimes the college, with a donation of a little money or produce from a farm, would buy groceries and dole them out to the teachers to at least try and provide them with food. We know something of your heritage, but even if we had been able to pay as many of you have paid for your education we, and you, must realize that the total price paid by any student of this college is far less than it costs this college to educate you. This is true not only of Eureka, but of the hundreds of schools and universities across the land.

Now today as you prepare to leave your Alma Mater, you go into a world in which, due to our carelessness and apathy, a great many of our freedoms have been lost. It isn't that an outside enemy has taken them. It's just that there is something inherent in government which makes it, when it isn't controlled, continue to grow. So today for every seven of us sitting here in this lovely outdoor theater, there is one public servant, and 31 cents of every dollar earned in America goes in taxes. To support the multitudinous and gigantic functions of government, taxation is levied which tends to dry up the very sources of contributions and donations to colleges like Eureka. So in this time of prosperity we find these church schools, these small independent colleges and even the larger universities, hard put to maintain themselves and to continue doing the job they have done so unselfishly and well for all these years. Observe the contrast between these small church colleges and our government, because, as I have said before, these have always given far more than was ever given to them in return.

Class of 1957, it will be part of the terms of the will for you to take stock in the days to come, because we enjoy a form of government in which mistakes can be rectified. The dictator can never admit he was wrong, but we are blessed with a form of government where we can call a halt, and say, "Back up. Let's take another look." Remember that every government service, every offer of government financed security, is paid for in the loss of personal freedom. I am not castigating government and business for those many areas of normal cooperation, for those services that we know we must have and that we do willingly support. It is very easy to give up our personal freedom to drive 90 miles an hour down a city street in return for the safety that we will get for ourselves and our loved ones. Of course, that might not be a good example, it seems sometimes that this is a thing we have paid for in advance and the merchandise hasn't yet been delivered. But in the days to come whenever a voice is raised telling you to let the government do it, analyze very carefully to see whether the suggested service is worth the personal freedom which you must forego in return for such service.

There are many well-meaning people today who work at placing an economic floor beneath all of us so that no one shall exist below a certain level or standard of living, and certainly we don't quarrel with this. But look more closely and you may find that all too often these well-meaning people are building a ceiling above which no one shall be permitted to climb and between the two are pressing us all into conformity, into a mold of standardized mediocrity. The tendency toward assembly-line education in some of our larger institutions, where we are not teaching but training to fulfill certain specific jobs in the economic life of our nation, is a part of this same pattern.

We have a vast system of public education in this country, a network of great state universities and colleges and none of us would have it otherwise. But there are those among us who urge expansion of this system until all education is by way of tax-supported institutions. Today we enjoy academic freedom in America as it is enjoyed nowhere else in the world. But this pattern was established by the independent secular and church colleges of our land, schools like Eureka. Down through the years these colleges and universities have maintained intellectual freedom because they were beholden to no political group, for when politics control the purse strings, they also control the policy. No one advocates the elimination of our tax-supported universities, but we should never forget that their academic freedom is assured only so long as we have the leavening influence of hundreds of privately endowed colleges and universities throughout the land.

So you should resolve, here and now, that you will not only accept your heritage but abide by the terms and conditions of the will. You should firmly resolve that these schools will not just be a part of America's past, but that they will continue to be a part of America's great future. Democracy with the personal freedoms that are ours we hold literally in trust for that day when we shall have fulfilled our destiny and brought mankind a great and long step from the swamps. Can we deliver it to our children? Democracy depends upon service voluntarily rendered, money voluntarily contributed.

These institutions which have contributed so much to us, from which we have received so much of our heritage, were here for our benefit only because our forefathers preferred voluntarily to support institutions of their choice in addition to sharing taxation for the support of governmental institutions. The will provides, class of 1957, not only that you receive this heritage and cherish it, but that you voluntarily tax your own time and your own money and contribute to these free institutions so that generations not yet born in this country and in the rest of the world, may benefit from this same heritage of freedom.

It will be very easy for you to say, "Well, I will do something, some day. When I can afford it, I am going to." But would you let an old "grad" tell you one thing now? Giving is a habit. Get into the habit now, because you will never be able to afford to give and contribute, thus to repay the obligation you owe to those people who made this college possible, if you wait until you think you can afford it. Start now regardless of how small, and in the days to come when you are confronted with demands for many worthwhile causes and charities I think you will find that you will give dutifully to all the worthy ones. But here and there you will pick one or two that will be favorites, and you can do no better than to pick this, your Alma Mater, because you will not only be repaying your own personal obligations, you will be making your contribution to the very process which has made and continues to keep America great.

This democracy of ours which sometimes we've treated so lightly, is more than ever a comfortable cloak, so let us not tear it asunder, for no man knows once it is destroyed where or when he will find its protective warmth again.

President Griswold, members of the faculty and fellows, graduates and their families, ladies and gentlemen:

Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for the very deep honor that you have conferred upon me. As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledges America to be the daughter of Europe, so I am pleased to come to Yale, the daughter of Harvard. It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds, a Harvard education and a Yale degree.

I am particularly glad to become a Yale man because as I think about my troubles, I find that a lot of them have come from other Yale men. Among businessmen, I've had a minor disagreement with Roger Blough of the law school class of 1931, and I've had some complaints too from my friend Henry Ford of the class of 1940. In journalism I seem to have some differences with John Hay Whitney, of the class of 1926 -- and sometimes I also displease Henry Luce of the class of 1920, not to mention always William F. Buckley, Jr. of the class of 1950. I even have some trouble with my Yale advisers. I get along with them, but I'm not always sure how they get along with each other. I have the warmest feelings for Chester Bowles of the class of 1924, and for Dean Acheson of the class of 1915, and my assistant, McGeorge Bundy, of the class of 1940. But I am not a hundred percent sure that these three wise and experienced Yale men wholly agree with each other on every issue.

So this Administration, which aims for peaceful cooperation among all Americans, has been the victim of a certain natural pugnacity developed in this city among Yale men. Now that I, too, am a Yale man, it is time for peace. Last week at West Point, in the historic tradition of that Academy, I availed myself of the powers of Commander-in-Chief to remit all sentences of offending cadets. In that same spirit, and in the historic tradition of Yale, let me now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all my brother Elis, and I hope that they may be friends not only with me but even with each other.

In any event, I am very glad to be here and as a new member of the club, I have been checking to see what earlier links existed between the institution of the Presidency and Yale. I found that a member of the class of 1878, William Howard Taft, served one term in the White House as preparation for becoming a member of this faculty. And a graduate of 1804, John C. Calhoun, regarded the Vice Presidency, quite naturally, as too lowly a status for a Yale alumnus -- and became the only man in history to ever resign that office.

Calhoun in 1804 and Taft in 1878 graduated into a world very different from ours today. They and their contemporaries spent entire careers stretching over 40 years in grappling with a few dramatic issues on which the nation was sharply and emotionally divided, issues that occupied the attention of a generation at a time: the national bank, the disposal of the public lands, nullification or union, freedom or slavery, gold or silver. Today these old sweeping issues have largely disappeared. The central domestic problems of our time are more subtle and less simple. They relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals -- to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues. The world of Calhoun, the world of Taft had its own hard problems and notable challenges. But its problems are not our problems. Their age is not our age. As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes, so in our time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality.

For the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.

Mythology distracts us everywhere -- in government as in business, in politics as in economics, in foreign affairs as in domestic affairs. But today I want to particularly consider the myth and reality in our national economy. In recent months many have come to feel, as I do, that the dialog between the parties -- between business and government, between the government and the public -- is clogged by illusion and platitude and fails to reflect the true realities of contemporary American society.

I speak of these matters here at Yale because of the self-evident truth that a great university is always enlisted against the spread of illusion and on the side of reality. No one has said it more clearly than your President Griswold: "Liberal learning is both a safeguard against false ideas of freedom and a source of true ones." Your role as university men, whatever your calling, will be to increase each new generation's grasp of its duties.

There are three great areas of our domestic affairs in which, today, there is a danger that illusion may prevent effective action. They are, first, the question of the size and the shape of government's responsibilities; secondly, the question of public fiscal policy; and third, the matter of confidence, business confidence, or public confidence, or simply confidence in America. I want to talk about all three, and I want to talk about them carefully and dispassionately -- and I emphasize that I am concerned here not with political debate but with finding ways to separate false problems from real ones.

If a contest in angry argument were forced upon it, no Administration could shrink from response, and history does not suggest that American Presidents are totally without resources in an engagement forced upon them because of hostility in one sector of society. But in the wider national interest, we need not partisan wrangling but common concentration on common problems. I come here to this distinguished university to ask you to join in this great task.

Let us take first the question of the size and the shape of government. The myth here is that government is big, and bad -- and steadily getting bigger and worse. Obviously this myth has some excuse for existence. It is true that in recent history each new Administration has spent much more money than its predecessor. Thus President Roosevelt outspent President Hoover, and with allowances for the special case of the Second World War, President Truman outspent President Roosevelt. Just to prove that this was not a partisan matter, President Eisenhower then outspent President Truman by the handsome figure of 182 billion dollars. It is even possible, some think, that this trend may continue.

But does it follow from this that big government is growing relatively bigger? It does not. For the fact is for the last 15 years, the Federal Government -- and also the Federal debt and also the Federal bureaucracy -- have grown less rapidly than the economy as a whole. If we leave defense and space expenditures aside, the Federal Government since the Second World War has expanded less than any other major section of our national life -- less than industry, less than commerce, less than agriculture, less than higher education, and very much less than the noise about big government.

The truth about big government is the truth about any other great activity -- it is complex. Certainly it is true that size brings dangers. But it is also true that size can bring benefits. Here at Yale which has contributed so much to our national progress in science and medicine, it may be proper for me to mention one great and little noticed expansion of government which has brought strength to our whole society -- the new role of our Federal Government as the major patron of research in science and in medicine. Few people realize that in 1961, in support of all university research in science and medicine, three dollars out of every four came from the Federal Government. I need hardly point out that this has taken place without undue enlargement of Government control -- that American scientists remain second to none in their independence and in their individualism.

I am not suggesting that Federal expenditures cannot bring some measure of control. The whole thrust of Federal expenditures in agriculture have been related by purpose and design to control, as a means of dealing with the problems created by our farmers and our growing productivity. Each sector, my point is, of activity must be approached on its own merits and in terms of specific national needs. Generalities in regard to Federal expenditures, therefore, can be misleading. Each case, science, urban renewal, agriculture, natural resources, each case must be determined on its merits if we are to profit from our unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose.

Next, let us turn to the problem of our fiscal myth. Here the myths are legion and the truth hard to find. But let me take as a prime example the problem of the Federal budget. We persist in measuring our Federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget with results which would be regarded as absurd in any business firm in any country of Europe or in any careful assessment of the reality of our national finances. The administrative budget has sound administrative uses. But for wider purposes it is less helpful. It omits our special trust funds and the effect that they have on our economy; it neglects changes in assets or inventories. It cannot tell a loan from a straight expenditure. And worst of all it cannot distinguish between operating expenditures and long term investment.

This problem, in relation -- This budget, in relation to the great problems of Federal fiscal policy which are basic to our country in 1962, is not simply irrelevant; it can be actively misleading. And yet there is a mythology that measures all of our national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget. If our Federal budget is to serve not the debate but the country, we must find ways of clarifying this area of discourse.

Still in the area of fiscal policy, let me say a word about deficits. The myth persists that Federal deficits create inflation and budget surpluses prevent it. Yet sizeable budget surpluses after the war did not prevent inflation, and persistent deficits for the last several years have not upset our basic price stability. Obviously deficits are sometimes dangerous -- and so are surpluses. But honest assessment plainly requires a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliché that deficits automatically bring inflation.

There are myths also about our public debt. It is widely supposed that this debt is growing at a dangerously rapid rate. In fact, both the debt per person and the debt as a proportion of our gross national product have declined sharply since the end of the Second World War. In absolute terms the national debt, since the end of World War II, has increased only 8 percent, while private debt was increasing 305 percent, and the debt of state and local governments -- on whom people frequently suggest we should place additional burdens -- the debt of state and local governments have increased 378 percent. Moreover, debts public and private, are neither good nor bad, in and of themselves. Borrowing can lead to over-extension and collapse. But it can also lead to expansion and strength. There is no single, simple slogan in this field that we can trust.

Finally, I come to the problem of confidence. Confidence is a matter of myth and also a matter of truth and this time let me make the truth of the matter first. It is true -- and of high importance--that the prosperity of this country depends on the assurance that all major elements within it will live up to their responsibilities. If business were to neglect its obligations to the public, if labor were blind to all public responsibility, above all, if government were to abandon its obvious and statutory duty of watchful concern for our economical health -- if any of these things should happen, then confidence might well be weakened and the danger of stagnation would increase. This is the true issue of confidence.

But there is also the false issue and in its simplest form is the assertion that any and all unfavorable turns of the speculative wheel -- however temporary and however plainly speculated in character -- are the result of, and I quote, "a lack of confidence in the national Administration." This, I must tell you, while comforting, is not wholly true. Worse, it obscures the reality -- which is also simple. The solid ground of mutual confidence is the necessary partnership of government with all of the sectors of our society in the steady quest for economic progress.

Corporate plans are not based on a political confidence in party leaders but on an economic confidence in the Nation's ability to invest and produce and consume. Business had full confidence in the Administrations in power in 1929, 1954, 1958, and 1960. But this was not enough to prevent recession when business lacked full confidence in the economy. What matters is the capacity of the Nation as a whole to deal with its economic problems and its opportunities.

The stereotypes I have been discussing distract our attention and divide our effort. These stereotypes do our Nation a disservice, not just because they're exhausted and irrelevant, but above all because they are misleading -- because they stand in the way of the solution of hard and complicated facts. It is not new that past debates should obscure present realities. But the damage of such a false dialogue is greater today than ever before simply because today the safety of all the world -- the very future of freedom -- depends as never before upon the sensible and clearheaded management of the domestic affairs of the United States.

The real issues of our time are rarely as dramatic as the issues of Calhoun. The differences today are usually matters of degree. And we cannot understand and attack our contemporary problems in 1962 if we are bound by traditional labels and worn out slogans of an earlier era. But the unfortunate fact of the matter is that our rhetoric has not kept pace with the speed of social and economic change. Our political debates, our public discourse -- on current domestic and economic issues -- too often bear little or no relation to the actual problems the United States faces.

What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion, but the practical management of a modern economy. What we need is not labels and clichés but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical questions involved in keeping a great economic machinery moving ahead.

The national interest lies in high employment and steady expansion of output, in stable prices, and a strong dollar. The declaration of such an objective is easy; their attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world is a little more difficult. To attain them, we require not some automatic response but hard thought. Let me end by suggesting a few of the real questions on our national agenda.

First, how can our budget and tax policies supply adequate revenues and preserve our balance of payments position without slowing up our economic growth? Two, how are we to set our interest rates and regulate the flow of money in ways which will stimulate the economy at home without weakening the dollar abroad? Given the spectrum of our domestic and international responsibilities, what should be the mix between fiscal and monetary policy? Let me give several examples from my experience of the complexity of these matters and how political labels and ideological approaches are irrelevant to the solution.Last week, a distinguished graduate of this school, Senator Proxmire, of the class of 1938, who is ordinarily regarded as a liberal Democrat, suggested that we should follow in meeting our economic problems a stiff fiscal policy, with emphasis on budget balance and an easy monetary policy with low interest rates in order to keep our economy going. In the same week, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel, Switzerland, a conservative organization representing the central bankers of Europe suggested that the appropriate economic policy in the United States should be the very opposite; that we should follow a flexible budget policy, as in Europe, with deficits when the economy is down and a high monetary policy on interest rates, as in Europe, in order to control inflation and protect goals. Both may be right or wrong. It will depend on many different factors. The point is that this is basically an administrative or executive problem in which political labels or clichés do not give us a solution.

A well-known business journal this morning, as I journeyed to New Haven, raised the prospects that a further budget deficit would bring inflation and encourage the flow of gold. We have had several budget deficits beginning with a 12 1/2 billion dollar deficit in '58, and it is true that in the fall of 1960 we had a gold dollar loss running at 5 billion dollars annually. This would seem to prove the case that a deficit produces inflation and that we lose gold, yet there was no inflation following the deficit of 1958 nor has there been inflation since then.

Our wholesale price index since 1958 has remained completely level in spite of several deficits, because the loss of gold has been due to other reasons: price instability, relative interest rates, relative export-import balances, national security expenditures -- all the rest.

Let me give you a third and final example. At the World Bank meeting in September, a number of American bankers attending predicted to their European colleagues that because of the fiscal 1962 budget deficit, there would be a strong inflationary pressure on the dollar and a loss of gold. Their predictions of inflation were shared by many in business and helped push the market up. The recent reality of noninflation helped bring it down. We have had no inflation because we have had other factors in our economy that have contributed to price stability.

I do not suggest that the government is right and they are wrong. The fact of the matter is in the Federal Reserve Board and in the Administration this fall, a similar view was held by many well-informed and disinterested men that inflation was the major problem that we would face in the winter of 1962. But it was not. What I do suggest is that these problems are endlessly complicated and yet they go to the future of this country and its ability to prove to the world what we believe it must prove.

I am suggesting that the problems of fiscal and monetary policies in the sixties as opposed to the kinds of problems we faced in the thirties demand subtle challenges for which technical answers, not political answers, must be provided. These are matters upon which government and business may and in many cases will disagree. They are certainly matters that government and business should be discussing in the most sober, dispassionate, and careful way if we are to maintain the kind of vigorous economy upon which our country depends.

How can we develop and sustain strong and stable world markets for basic commodities without unfairness to the consumer and without undue stimulus to the producer? How can we generate the buying power which can consume what we produce on our farms and in our factories? How can we take advantage of the miracles of automation with the great demand that it will put upon high-skilled labor and yet offer employment to the half a million of unskilled school dropouts every year who enter the labor market, eight million of them in the 1960's?

How do we eradicate the barriers which separate substantial minorities of our citizens from access to education and employment on equal terms with the rest?

How, in sum, can we make our free economy work at full capacity -- that is, provide adequate profits for enterprise, adequate wages for labor, and adequate utilization of plant, and opportunity for all?

These are the problems that we should be talking about -- that the political parties and the various groups in our country should be discussing. They cannot be solved by incantations from the forgotten past. But the example of Western Europe shows that they are capable of solution -- that governments, and many of them are conservative governments, prepared to face technical problems without ideological preconceptions, can coordinate the elements of a national economy, and bring about growth and prosperity -- a decade of it, a decade of it.

Some conversations I have heard in our own country sound like old records, long-playing, left over from the middle thirties. The debate of the thirties had its great significance and produced great results, but it took place in a different world with different needs and different tasks. It is our responsibility today to live in our own world, and to identify the needs and discharge the tasks of the 1960's.

If there's any current trend towards meeting present problems with old clichés, this is the moment to stop it -- before it lands us all in a bog of sterile acrimony.

Discussion is essential; and I am hopeful that the debate of recent weeks, though up to now somewhat barren, may represent the start of a serious dialog of the kind which has led in Europe to such fruitful collaboration among all the elements of economic society and to a decade of unrivaled economic progress. But let us not engage in the wrong argument at the wrong time between the wrong people in the wrong country -- while the real problems of our own time grow and multiply, fertilized by our neglect.

Nearly 150 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote, "The new circumstances under which we are placed call for new words, new phrases, and the transfer of old words to new objects." New words, new phrases, the transfer of old words to new objects -- that is truer today than it was in the time of Jefferson, because the role of this country is so vastly more significant.

There is a show in England called "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off." You have not chosen to exercise that option. You are part of the world and you must participate in these days of our years in the solution of the problems that pour upon us, requiring the most sophisticated and technical judgment; and as we work in consonance to meet the authentic problems of our times, we will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society.

President Anderson, members of the faculty, board of trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague, Senator Bob Byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of attending night law school, while I am earning mine in the next 30 minutes, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: 

It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony of the American University, sponsored by the Methodist Church, founded by Bishop John Fletcher Hurst, and first opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. This is a young and growing university, but it has already fulfilled Bishop Hurst's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and the conduct of the public's business. By sponsoring this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn, whatever their color or their creed, the Methodists of this area and the Nation deserve the Nation's thanks, and I commend all those who are today graduating. 

Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time, and I am confident that the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high measure of public service and public support. 

"There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university," wrote John Masefield in his tribute to English universities--and his words are equally true today. He did not refer to spires and towers, to campus greens and ivied walls. He admired the splendid beauty of the university, he said, because it was "a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see." 

I have, therefore, chosen this time and this place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived--yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace. 

What kind of peace do I mean? What kind of peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children--not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women--not merely peace in our time but peace for all time. 

I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn. 

Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy and never create--is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace. 

I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war--and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task. 

Some say that it is useless to speak of world peace or world law or world disarmament--and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we can help them do it. But I also believe that we must reexamine our own attitude--as individuals and as a Nation--for our attitude is as essential as theirs. And every graduate of this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet Union, toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home. 

First: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable--that mankind is doomed--that we are gripped by forces we cannot control. 

We need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable--and we believe they can do it again. 

I am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of peace and good will of which some fantasies and fanatics dream. I do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making that our only and immediate goal. 

Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace-- based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions--on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to this peace--no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each new generation. For peace is a process--a way of solving problems. 

With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors. 

So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it. 

Second: Let us reexamine our attitude toward the Soviet Union. It is discouraging to think that their leaders may actually believe what their propagandists write. It is discouraging to read a recent authoritative Soviet text on Military Strategy and find, on page after page, wholly baseless and incredible claims--such as the allegation that "American imperialist circles are preparing to unleash different types of wars . . . that there is a very real threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American imperialists against the Soviet Union . . . [and that] the political aims of the American imperialists are to enslave economically and politically the European and other capitalist countries . . . [and] to achieve world domination . . . by means of aggressive wars." 

Truly, as it was written long ago: "The wicked flee when no man pursueth." Yet it is sad to read these Soviet statements--to realize the extent of the gulf between us. But it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats. 

No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements--in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage. 

Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war. Almost unique among the major world powers, we have never been at war with each other. And no nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union suffered in the course of the Second World War. At least 20 million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and farms were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's territory, including nearly two thirds of its industrial base, was turned into a wasteland--a loss equivalent to the devastation of this country east of Chicago. 

Today, should total war ever break out again--no matter how--our two countries would become the primary targets. It is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first 24 hours. And even in the cold war, which brings burdens and dangers to so many nations, including this Nation's closest allies--our two countries bear the heaviest burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combating ignorance, poverty, and disease. We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counterweapons. 

In short, both the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race. Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet Union as well as ours--and even the most hostile nations can be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own interest. 

So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal. 

Third: Let us reexamine our attitude toward the cold war, remembering that we are not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment. We must deal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history of the last 18 years been different. 

We must, therefore, persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us. We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace. Above all, while defending our own vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war. To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy--or of a collective death-wish for the world. 

To secure these ends, America's weapons are nonprovocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter, and capable of selective use. Our military forces are committed to peace and disciplined in self- restraint. Our diplomats are instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely rhetorical hostility. 

For we can seek a relaxation of tension without relaxing our guard. And, for our part, we do not need to use threats to prove that we are resolute. We do not need to jam foreign broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded. We are unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people--but we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth. 

Meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to help solve its financial problems, to make it a more effective instrument for peace, to develop it into a genuine world security system--a system capable of resolving disputes on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms can finally be abolished. 

At the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-Communist world, where many nations, all of them our friends, are divided over issues which weaken Western unity, which invite Communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into war. Our efforts in West New Guinea, in the Congo, in the Middle East, and in the Indian subcontinent, have been persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides. We have also tried to set an example for others--by seeking to adjust small but significant differences with our own closest neighbors in Mexico and in Canada. 

Speaking of other nations, I wish to make one point clear. We are bound to many nations by alliances. Those alliances exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap. Our commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin, for example, stands undiminished because of the identity of our vital interests. The United States will make no deal with the Soviet Union at the expense of other nations and other peoples, not merely because they are our partners, but also because their interests and ours converge 

Our interests converge, however, not only in defending the frontiers of freedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace. It is our hope-- and the purpose of allied policies--to convince the Soviet Union that she, too, should let each nation choose its own future, so long as that choice does not interfere with the choices of others. The Communist drive to impose their political and economic system on others is the primary cause of world tension today. For there can be no doubt that, if all nations could refrain from interfering in the self-determination of others, the peace would be much more assured. 

This will require a new effort to achieve world law--a new context for world discussions. It will require increased understanding between the Soviets and ourselves. And increased understanding will require increased contact and communication. One step in this direction is the proposed arrangement for a direct line between Moscow and Washington, to avoid on each side the dangerous delays, misunderstandings, and misreadings of the other's actions which might occur at a time of crisis. 

We have also been talking in Geneva about the other first-step measures of arms control designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and to reduce the risks of accidental war. Our primary long range interest in Geneva, however, is general and complete disarmament-- designed to take place by stages, permitting parallel political developments to build the new institutions of peace which would take the place of arms. The pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this Government since the 1920's. It has been urgently sought by the past three administrations. And however dim the prospects may be today, we intend to continue this effort--to continue it in order that all countries, including our own, can better grasp what the problems and possibilities of disarmament are. 

The one major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight, yet where a fresh start is badly needed, is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards. 

I am taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two important decisions in this regard. 

First: Chairman khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, and I have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty. Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history--but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind. 

Second: To make clear our good faith and solemn convictions on the matter, I now declare that the United States does not propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as other states do not do so. We will not be the first to resume. Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal binding treaty, but I hope it will help us achieve one. Nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament, but I hope it will help us achieve it. 

Finally, my fellow Americans, let us examine our attitude toward peace and freedom here at home. The quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our efforts abroad. We must show it in the dedication of our own lives--as many of you who are graduating today will have a unique opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps abroad or in the proposed National Service Corps here at home. 

But wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together. In too many of our cities today, the peace is not secure because the freedom is incomplete. 

It is the responsibility of the executive branch at all levels of government--local, State, and National--to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means within their authority. It is the responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels, wherever that authority is not now adequate, to make it adequate. And it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this country to respect the rights of all others and to respect the law of the land. 

All this is not unrelated to world peace. "When a man's ways please the Lord," the Scriptures tell us, "he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him." And is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights--the right to live out our lives without fear of devastation--the right to breathe air as nature provided it--the right of future generations to a healthy existence? 

While we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let us also safeguard human interests. And the elimination of war and arms is clearly in the interest of both. No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion. But it can--if it is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers--offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race. 

The United States, as the world knows, will never start a war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This generation of Americans has already had enough--more than enough--of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we labor on--not toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace. 

President Hatcher, Governor Romney, Senators McNamara and Hart, Congressmen Meader and Staebler, and other members of the fine Michigan delegation, members of the graduating class, my fellow Americans:

It is a great pleasure to be here today. This university has been coeducational since 1870, but I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl said (and I quote), "In choosing a college, you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school." Well, we can find both here at Michigan, although perhaps at different hours. I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son's education had been a real value. It stopped his mother from bragging about him.

I have come today from the turmoil of your capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country. The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people. Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation.

For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent. For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people. The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization.

Your imagination and your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth. For in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.

The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning.

The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what is adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.

But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.

So I want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the Great Society -- in our cities, in our countryside, and in our classrooms.

Many of you will live to see the day, perhaps 50 years from now, when there will be 400 million Americans -- four-fifths of them in urban areas. In the remainder of this century urban population will double, city land will double, and we will have to build homes and highways and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled. So in the next 40 years we must re-build the entire urban United States.

Aristotle said: "Men come together in cities in order to live, but they remain together in order to live the good life." It is harder and harder to live the good life in American cities today. The catalog of ills is long: there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs. There is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic. Open land is vanishing and old landmarks are violated. Worst of all expansion is eroding these precious and time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature. The loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference.

And our society will never be great until our cities are great. Today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders. New experiments are already going on. It will be the task of your generation to make the American city a place where future generations will come, not only to live, but to live the good life. And I understand that if I stayed here tonight I would see that Michigan students are really doing their best to live the good life.

This is the place where the Peace Corps was started.

It is inspiring to see how all of you, while you are in this country, are trying so hard to live at the level of the people.

A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is in our countryside. We have always prided ourselves on being not only America the strong and America the free, but America the beautiful. Today that beauty is in danger. The water we drink, the food we eat, the very air that we breathe, are threatened with pollution. Our parks are overcrowded, our seashores overburdened. Green fields and dense forests are disappearing.

A few years ago we were greatly concerned about the "Ugly American." Today we must act to prevent an ugly America.

For once the battle is lost, once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured. And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted.

A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of America. There your children's lives will be shaped. Our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination. We are still far from that goal. Today, 8 million adult Americans, more than the entire population of Michigan, have not finished 5 years of school. Nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school. Nearly 54 million -- more than one quarter of all America -- have not even finished high school.

Each year more than 100,000 high school graduates, with proved ability, do not enter college because they cannot afford it. And if we cannot educate today's youth, what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960? And high school enrollment will rise by 5 million. And college enrollment will increase by more than 3 million.

In many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated. Most of our qualified teachers are underpaid and many of our paid teachers are unqualified. So we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from. Poverty must not be a bar to learning, and learning must offer an escape from poverty.

But more classrooms and more teachers are not enough. We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size. This means better training for our teachers. It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor. It means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.

These are three of the central issues of the Great Society. While our Government has many programs directed at those issues, I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems. But I do promise this: We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for America.

I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of White House conferences and meetings -- on the cities, on natural beauty, on the quality of education, and on other emerging challenges. And from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these studies we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society.

The solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in Washington, nor can it rely solely on the strained resources of local authority. They require us to create new concepts of cooperation, a creative federalism, between the National Capital and the leaders of local communities.

Woodrow Wilson once wrote: "Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time."

Within your lifetime powerful forces, already loosed, will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience, almost beyond the bounds of our imagination.

For better or for worse, your generation has been appointed by history to deal with those problems and to lead America toward a new age. You have the chance never before afforded to any people in any age. You can help build a society where the demands of morality, and the needs of the spirit, can be realized in the life of the Nation.

So, will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the law requires, whatever his belief, or race, or the color of his skin?

Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty?

Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace -- as neighbors and not as mortal enemies?

Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society, to prove that our material progress is only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit?

There are those timid souls that say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth. I do not agree. We have the power to shape the civilization that we want. But we need your will and your labor and your hearts, if we are to build that kind of society.

Those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country. They sought a new world. So I have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality. So let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back and say: It was then, after a long and weary way, that man turned the exploits of his genius to the full enrichment of his life.

Thank you. Good-bye.

It is a special pleasure for me to be with you today. I suppose that any politician is always pleased to couple someone else's memorable occasion with a few modest words of his own. It gives him hope that both may be remembered.

Wellesley has even more admirers than its girls have beaux, and I am pleased to be among this college's most enthusiastic boosters. But your commencement from this great school is not a moment to indulge in lavish praise of the fine education you have acquired here, though fine it is. Nor Is It a time for extravagant rhetoric about the glorious future which awaits you, though glorious I hope it will be.

Rather I think you and I might better spend this time in a more sober assessment of the kind of society which is developing around us all. For the individual prospects of each of us are directly dependent on the outcome of the mounting social struggles now under way in this country. Most of us have come to see that personal insulation from the conflict and instability of our time is a dubious and unattainable luxury.' It is as true today as it was at the time of the Declaration of Independence that "we must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately." The social crises of this country have many dimensions; it would be futile to address all of them In a brief statement. Rather than deal with the more controversial issues, I hope you will permit me to offer some reflections on one of the safer and less inflammatory topics of the day, the protest movement in general, and the character and function of student protests in particular. Standing as I do somewhere between fading youth and advancing obsolescence, I hope it will be possible for me to speak both to your generation and to my own.

The waves of protests passing over the United States both mirror and create deep social tension. In some cases one finds it extremely difficult, if not totally Impossible, to determine which protests are based on-just grievances and which are merely exploiting issues for the sake of some ulterior purpose. It begins to appear that the process of protest has assumed a self-sustaining momentum, searching for political fodder on which to thrive. As the process continues, particular issues tend to get submerged in the larger confrontation, a contest of will and power which is justified initially as a means of correcting identified evils but which sometimes persists as an end in its own right.

The dynamics of protest are familiar. In the United States, more than any country I know, there has always been generous latitude for movements of this nature. And for good reason. Dissent and protest are essential ingredients in the democratic concoction. Without them an open society becomes a contradiction in terms, and representative government becomes as stagnant as despotism.

Yet there is a narrow but distinct line between productive dissent and counter-productive disruption. The distinction concerns both the methods and the purposes of protest activities. Much has already been said about the limits of dissent. When all is said and done, when abundant angels have danced on the heads of pins and countless philosophers have offered their exquisite rationalizations, I believe the overwhelming majority of Americans will stand firm on one principle: Coercive protest is wrong. And one reason it is wrong is because it is unnecessary.

So long as a society retains a capacity for non-violent political change, resort to violent political action is anathema. Only if most Americans were convinced that this country was no longer open to peaceful political evolution, to transformation of institutions and policies through the available channels of persuasion, would they consider revolutionary force permissible. That most Americans are not so convinced is evident in the growing vehemence of public attitudes on campus disorders and in the rising popular impatience with the efforts of academic administrators to deal fairly and considerately with student rebels.

The intensity of feeling on this matter is well conveyed by Al Capp in his comment on Harvard's reluctance to discipline those demonstrators who assaulted Robert McNamara some months ago. Apart from an apology to the visitor, the college dean declined to take action on the ground that the students who accosted Mr. McNamara were engaged in a purely political activity. "if depriving a man of his freedom to speak, if depriving him of his freedom to move, if ... nearly depriving him of his life -- if that's political activity," says Capp, "then ... sticking up a gas station is a financial transaction.'' On this point I suspect that Mr. Capp is less the social critic than the authentic voice of the society he has so often satirized.

Whatever the romantics may say about violence in our national life, the use of force is repugnant to the spirit of American politics. Paradoxically, the introduction of coercion as an instrument of protest may serve only to legitimize the use of force to deal with the protesters. There has been a great deal of theorizing, especially in the cloisters of the New Left, about the technique of social polarization. Some self-proclaimed radicals have contended that by triggering the use of official force against themselves, they can win the sympathy of uncommitted groups and undermine support for existing authority. This is a description, albeit a pat one, of what may happen in some circumstances. But the insight is a superficial one, and the prescription a highly unreliable one.

The most celebrated applications of such a doctrine, as at Chicago last year, are Pyrrhic victories at best. Survey after survey makes clear that a frequent result of coercive protests is the isolation of the protesters and increasing public demand for the prompt and vigorous application of official force against them. Potential allies are more often alienated than enlisted by such activities, and their empathy for the professed goals of the protesters is destroyed by their outrage at the procedures employed.

In short it behooves the disciples of protest as politics to reconsider the alleged merits of coercive tactics. By now they should be able to see that, apart from being morally insupportable, such methods are politically ineffective.

But more than method is involved in measuring the propriety and utility of protest. Even if the techniques of dissent are impeccable in their respect for the rights of others, the substance of dissent needs to be examined closely. Protest without purpose is a perversion of democratic privilege. Much of the political instability in the country and on the campuses, it seems to me, stems from the fact that the process of protest to which I referred earlier has assumed a life of its own, considerably independent of specific issues and problems. This is not entirely surprising, since a number of individuals have gained a vested interest in protest as a profession. It is a novel establishment, to be sure, but there is good evidence that protest itself has become a kind of institution in recent years.

The consequences of this development are many and complex. As anyone familiar with human organization would expect, the institutionalization of protest tends to subordinate substance to style, to emphasize practice rather than purpose. The focus comes to be less and less on issues and more and more on the mechanics of protest. Social and political problems become vehicles to be ridden instead of barriers to be overcome. The issues are multiplied for the sake of expediency, but the mingling of the trivial with the substantial makes it difficult to distinguish between them.

This sort of progressive de-focusing serves to confuse, not to clarify, political debate. The dialogue grows louder, but less coherent. We hear talk of the "mood of protest" gripping the nation, a vague and generalized discontent with the state of the country and the world.

But widespread malaise creates only a context for social change; it does not generate a program for change. One cannot produce a constructive program for social action without sorting out the critical issues from the less critical and without making concrete plans to cope with the priority problems. To demand change without some reasonable notion of what specific kind of change is possible and desirable amounts to little more than primitive breast-beating.

Obviously, my remarks oversimplify the present situation. Many protests are focused and are directed toward well-identified goals, although that is no guarantee of their wisdom. What I am anxious to highlight here are the tendencies inherent in some current political action. In my judgment these tendencies, should they proceed unchallenged, point toward a serious and chronic corruption of the political process.

If this apprehension is correct, it is very important to point out these tendencies to the potential recruits of the protest movements. As we have seen in the colleges and universities, large numbers of these prospective recruits are youngsters from well-to-do or middle-class families, rather than those of more disadvantaged backgrounds. The Students for a Democratic Society and similar groups draw much active and latent support from what has been aptly termed the "lumpenbourgeosie," the middle-class masses.

I think it is indisputable that these and other members of your generation are, intellectually and otherwise, among the more well-equipped citizens in the history of the United States. It would be tragic if they adopted disaffection as a way of life. They must be shown that there are definite alternatives to perpetual protest as a means of linking ideals to actions.

Indeed we all need such alternatives, whatever our age or station in life. It is a common insight of psychology that human beings need a sense of efficacy, a feeling that their actions are effective and that they have a meaningful degree of control over their own lives. What is true for Individuals in their personal lives is also true in the social realm, especially for activists. There is a craving to understand the pace and direction of change in society, and to be able to have some measure of influence in steering the course the nation will follow.

But the social analysis associated with some of the contemporary protest movements is a poor guide for Individual or collective action. The ideology of the New Left, like that of the super-conservatism that flared briefly in the early nineteen-sixties, is but remotely connected to the realities of American society in our time. It is a curious hodge-podge of Marxist, or neo-Marxist, or pseudo-Marxist, or crypto-Maoist doctrines, fascinating to debate but irrelevant to enact.

This political potpourri mixes genuine social concern with some wildly incorrect "lessons" of social history. Mark Twain once observed that "One should be careful to got out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it -- and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on the hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again -- and that's well; but she will never sit down on a cold one either." Among many of our most sophisticated "cats," there is a strong temptation to over-interpret and over-generalize. Those who aspire to effective political activism would do well to resist that temptation.

If we are to devise sensible standards and functions for protest or any other form of political action, we shall first have to develop an accurate, balanced and comprehensive perspective on the immense social forces already at work in our society. It will hardly do for one to ignore, out of convenience or calculation, the facts which do not fit some pre-conceived ideology. I do not presume to claim that I have the scoop on the intricate eddies which move this nation. But there are a number of major trends which should be a factor in any projection of American social development.

Perhaps the most fundamental of these trends is the growing mobilization of this country's public and private resources to deal with our domestic problems. The philosophy of Dr. Pangloss, who proclaimed that "this is the best of all possible worlds," has never found much favor in the United States. But in recent years this country's citizens and institutions have become increasingly aroused to erase the blemishes on our body politic. In this respect the protest movements reflect and stimulate the healthy self-criticism taking place throughout the nation.

It is a very significant fact that America has identified more precisely than ever before the nature and magnitude of its acute social problems. Racial and social injustice is being seen in concrete terms, as a root cause of human misery and as a principal obstacle to the further development of this-nation. Poverty, hunger, unemployment, inferior education, inadequate health care -- these grave inequities are now being recognized for what they are, the responsibility of society as a whole as well as the individuals involved.

From this spreading perception has emerged a wholly different attitude toward government. Even after the Great Depression there was a lingering reluctance to have the government act vigorously to meet social needs. But the new awareness that sizeable human problems still exist in this land of plenty has created an actual demand for government to act or to help others act to relieve them. While there is justified skepticism regarding the effectiveness of some programs, there is an equally justified insistence that various programs must at least be tried.

We ought to realize that, largely because of these altered attitudes, the United States is now well into an unprecedented period of social and political experimentation. In the decades since the Second World War, the power and authority of government have been enlisted to combat racial discrimination in education, in employment, in voting, in housing and in other areas. New cabinet departments have been established to cope with critical domestic requirements: Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation. A host of other innovations have appeared: The Office of Economic Opportunity, with Its community action agencies; the Model Cities Program; the manpower Development and Training Administration; the Community Relations Service.

The mere catalogue of federal agencies scarcely indicates that adequate programs and funds are now in existence. But it does afford a vital comparison with the governmental organization of 1950 or even later, when there were virtually no agencies with major responsibilities for the problems we now see so vividly.

Has this proliferation of effort, and a parallel expansion of private activities, had any effect? The question is very debateable when one speaks of certain programs, but in the main and overall, I think the answer is a resounding "yea." We are a long way from the good society we seek, but not nearly so far as we would have been without the evolutionary changes which have marked private attitudes and public institutions. We now have a valuable degree of continuity in efforts to evaluate and cope with a broad spectrum of social problems. There remains a great need for experimentation and for improved use of our resources in these areas. Still greater is the need to expand the level of effort generally on these gigantic tasks of social reconstruction.

It would be sheer folly to assume that, simply because we have these new programs, things will automatically get better. Yet it would also be foolish to propound demands for social change in a vacuum, oblivious to the substantial changes already in progress.

But, one may ask, is this all an institutional facade behind which little is really accomplished? I think not.

If one takes what might be called the summary problem of our society, the persistence of poverty amid affluence, there has been measurable progress in these years. In 1959 some 22% of the nation's households were poor; by 1967 those below the poverty line totalled 13.3%. One can properly state, in viewing this trend that the bottle of poverty is still more than half full, but it is worth noting that it is less full than before.

Special services to the disadvantaged have also been expanding, but the key point is that the total number of poor is now sufficiently small to contemplate rapid and large-scale action to end poverty. The Council of Economic Advisors now estimates the poverty gap, the sum required to lift all Americans out of nominal poverty, is less than $10 billion a year. That figure is not vastly beyond the recent increases in Annual expenditures on domestic programs. For example, in the coming fiscal year, despite the tremendous budgetary competition, President Nixon is proposing to expand human resources funding by $5.5 billion, a 10% increase over 1969.

At the same time there is serious thought being given to many different aspects of the poverty problem. Attempts to end the deprivation of children are a paramount concern. The Administration is now committed to a $2.5 billion program to combat hunger, still inadequate but a solid step forward. Since most of the poor are employed full time, contrary to the popular impression that welfare rolls are carrying most of the poverty-stricken, special emphasis is directed toward manpower training and upgrading of jail skills.

In short, these and numerous other important initiatives reveal something other than a decadent society. They suggest a nation worried about its integrity, as it should be, and concerned about its people, as it must be. They suggest that this is a time for pitching in, not for opting out. They indicate the awakening of a very imperfect society, trying to be better than it is. And that, I submit, should give a measure of hope to us all.

My message today is a simple one. Lest it be misunderstood in the more complicated discussion of social trends and innovations, let me state it briefly.

This country has profound and pressing social problems on its agenda. It needs the best energies of all its citizens, especially Its gifted young people, to remedy these ills.
Let us not dissipate these energies on phony Issues or misguided missions.
Let us not mistake the vigor of protest for the value of accomplishment.
Let us direct the zeal of every concerned American to the real problems.
Let us forsake false drama for true endeavor.
Let us, in short, recognize that ours is a precious community that demands and deserves the best that is in us.

sKin Hubbard was an Indianapolis newspaper humorist. He wrote under the name of Abe Martin. My father, who was an Indianapolis architect, knew him some. Kin Hubbard had fault to find with commencement addresses. He thought that all the really important information should be spread out over four years, instead of being saved up for one big speech at the very end.

That is an elegant joke, although nobody here seems to be hemorrhaging with laughter. That is just as well. I want us to be serious. I want us to ponder seriously about commencement addresses, to realize what it is that is withheld from students until the very end. In the fiction game, we call a marvelous thing withheld until the very end “the snapper” of a tale. O. Henry probably devised more snappers than any other writer in history. So what is the snapper of a college education? What is the thing that colleges hire outsiders to deliver on commencement day?

The outsider is expected to answer the questions: what is life all about, and what are new college graduates supposed to do with it now?

This information has to be saved up until the very end for this good reason: no responsible, truth-loving teacher can answer those questions in class, or even in the privacy of his office or home. No respecter of evidence has ever found the least clue as to what life is all about, and what people should do with it.

Oh, there have been lots of brilliant guesses. But honest, educated people have to identify with them as such – as guesses. What are guesses worth? Scientifically and legally, they are not worth doodley-squat. As the saying goes: “Your guess is as good as mine.”

The guesses we like best, as with so many things we like best, were taught to us in childhood – by people who loved us and wished us well. We are reluctant to criticize those guesses. It is an ultimate act of rudeness to find fault with anything which is given to us in a spirit of love. So a modern, secular education is often painful. By its very nature, it invites us to question the wisdom of the ones we love.

Too bad.

I have said that one guess is as good as another, but that is only roughly so. Some guesses are crueler than others – which is to say, harder on human beings, and on other animals as well. The belief that God wants heretics burned to death is a case in point. Some guesses are more suicidal than others. The belief that a true lover of God is immune to the bites of copperheads and rattlesnakes is a case in point. Some guesses are greedier and more egocentric than others. Belief in the divine right of kings and presidents is a case in point.

Those are all discredited guesses. But it is reasonable to suppose that other bad guesses are poisoning our lives today. A good education in skepticism can help us to discover those bad guesses, and to destroy them with mockery and contempt. Most of them were made by honest, decent people who had no way of knowing what we know, or what we can find out, if we want to. We have one hell of a lot of good information about our bodies, about our planet, and the universe – about our past. We don’t have to guess as much as the old folks did.

Bertrand Russell declared that, in case he met God, he would say to Him, “Sir, you did not give us enough information.” I would add to that, “All the same, Sir, I’m not persuaded that we did the best we could with the information we had. Toward the end there, anyway we had tons of information.”

Our most dismaying failure is in the use of our knowledge of what human beings need in the way of bodily and spiritual nourishment. And I suspect that some of the guesses made by our ancestors are partly responsible for the starved bodies and sprits we see everywhere.

Shame on us. Less shame on our ancestors.

I myself am an ancestor, having reproduced, having written books, being fifty-one years old. I come from simpler times. When I was a boy, all a commencement speaker had to say was, “Go out and kill Hitler, boy. And then get married and have a lot of kids.”

Some of you might still want to go looking for Hitler, in Paraguay, say. He might be there. He would be eighty-five years old now. He has probably shaved off his mustache.

Some of you might go out and kill communists, but that is no longer a fashionable thing to do. And you wouldn’t be killing real communists anyway. This country has fulfilled more of the requirements of the Communist Manifesto that any avowedly communist nation ever did. Maybe we’re the communists.

Our politicians like to say that we have religion and the communist countries don’t. I think it is just the other way around. Those countries have a religion called Communism, and the Free World is where sustaining religions are in very short supply.

I am about to make my own ancestral guess as to what life is all about, and what young people should do with it. I will again issue the caveat that I am as full of baloney as anybody, and that anybody who says for sure what life is all about might as well lecture on Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, and Tooth Fairies, as well.

I am, incidentally, the world’s greatest authority on Tooth Fairies. That is how most of my life has been spent: in the study of Tooth Fairies. That should be carved on my tombstone. I was the one who discovered that Tooth Fairies are cannibals. Mostly, Tooth Fairies eat Junebugs, of course. But under crowded conditions and in an atmosphere rich in carbon monoxide, Tooth Fairies eat each other, too.

And who can blame them?

O.K.

What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured. Young people should also identify and encourage beliefs about life on which sane human beings almost everywhere can believe.

I suggest even here we need a new religion. If suggesting that we need a new religion is sacrilege, then the Emperor Constantine was guilty of sacrilege, and the Emperor Nero was an admirably pious man. And I want to point out that it is impossible to discard an old religion entirely. The religion of Nero survives today, determining as it does the dates and even moods of so many of our so-called Christian holidays.

Easter is a time for the renewal of life, and it always has been, apparently, even when people ate mastodon meat. Nothing is more human than to wish for renewal when springtime comes. And, out of respect for our ancesters, it is in the area of spiritual renewal that we are the most conservative and we must become less conservative.

What makes me think we need a new religion? That’s easy. An effective religion allows people to imagine from moment to moment what is going on and how they should behave. Christianity used to be like that. Our country is now jammed with human beings who say out loud that life is chaos to them, and that it doesn’t seem to matter what anybody does next. This is worse than being seasick.

Might not we do without religion entirely? Plenty of people have tried – not in communistic countries, as I’ve already said, but here. A lot of people have been forced to do without it – because the old time religions they know of are too superstitious, too full of magic, too ignorant about biology and physics to harmonize with the present day.

They are told to have faith. Faith in what? Faith in faith, as nearly as I can tell. That is as detailed as many contemporary preachers care to be, except when amazing audiences of cave men. How can a preacher tell us about men and women who heard voices without raising questions about schizophrenia, a disease which we know is common in all places and all times.

We know too much for old time religion; and in a way, knowledge is killing us.

The Book of Genesis is usually taken to be a story about what happened a long time ago. The beginning of it, at least, can also be read as a prophecy of what is going on right now. It may be that Eden is this planet. If that is so, then we are still in it. It may be that we, poisoned by all our knowledge, are still crawling toward the gate.

Can we spit out all our knowledge? I don’t think that is possible. It is something I have often wanted to do. We are stuck with our knowledge, which has seeped into all of our tissues. We had better make the best of a bad situation, which is a wonderful human skill. We had better make use of what has poisoned us, which is knowledge.

What can we use it for?

Why don’t we use it to devise realistic methods for preventing us from crawling out the gate at the Garden of Eden. We’re such wonderful mechanics, maybe we can lock that gate, with us inside.

It is springtime here in Paradise. There is hope in the air!

If I talk about the Loud family now, will all of you know who I mean? I don’t mean everybody’s noisy neighbors, I mean a family of prosperous human beings in California, whose last name is Loud. They were the willing subjects last year of a television documentary. Seemingly invisible cameramen and sound men were able to record for all time even the most disappointing and embarrassing moments in their lives.

Most viewers, and the Louds themselves, claimed to be mystified by the tin-horn tragedies and un-funny comedies thus immortalized. I suggest to you that the Louds were healthy Earthlings who had everything but a religion in which they could believe. There was nothing to tell them what they should want, what they should shun, what they should do next. Socrates told us that the unexamined life wasn’t worth living. The Louds demonstrated that the morally unstructured life is a clunker, too.

Christianity could not nourish the Louds. Neither could Buddhism or the profit motive of participation in the arts, or any other nostrum on America’s spiritual smorgasbord. So the Louds were dying before our eyes.

If my analysis is correct, then we have a formula for more such successful TV shows. Each show can feature an otherwise healthy family, from which a single life-sustaining element has been withheld. We might begin with the Watson family, which has everything but water. But no family could survive an entire television season without water, so we had better give the Watsons a diet absolutely devoid of B vitamin complex, instead.

We wouldn’t tell the audience or the critics or the Watsons what was really wrong with the Watsons. We would pretend to be as puzzled as anybody about why they weren’t happier with their quadraphonic sound system and their tap dancing lessons and their Pontiac Ventura and all. We would take part in symposia with ministers and sociologists, and so forth, reaching no firm conclusions – while the Watsons slowly die of beri-beri.

A microscopic quantity of vitamins could save the Watsons. But a ton of Billy Grahams couldn’t save the Louds. They know too much.

Now is as good a time as any to mention White House Prayer Breakfasts, I guess. I think we all know now that religion of that sort is about as nourishing to the human spirit as potassium cyanide. We have been experimenting with it. Every guinea pig died. We are up to our necks in dead guinea pigs.

The lethal ingredient in those breakfasts wasn’t prayer. And it wasn’t the eggs or the orange juice or the hominy grits. It was a virulent new strain of hypocrisy which did everyone in.

Talk about typhoid Mary!

If I have offended anyone here by talking of the need of a new religion, I apologize. I am willing to drop the word religion, and substitute three other words for it. Three other words are heartfelt moral code. We sure need such a thing, and it should be simple enough and reasonable enough for anyone to understand. The trouble with so many of the moral codes we have inherited is that they are subject to so many interpretations. We require specialists, historians and archaeologists and linguists and so on, to tell us where this or that idea may have come from, to suggest what this or that statement might actually mean. This is good news for hypocrites, who enjoy feeling pious, no matter what they do.

If we were to try to grow recent strains of hypocrisy in the laboratory, what would we grow them in? I think they would grow like Jack’s beanstalk in an homogenized mulch of ancient moral codes.

It may be that moral simplicity is not possible in modern times. It may be that simplicity and clarity can come only from a new Messiah, who may never come. We can talk about portents, if you like. I like a good portent as much as anyone. What might be the meaning of the Comet Kahoutek, which was to make us look upward, to impress us with the paltriness of our troubles, to cleanse our souls with cosmic awe. Kahoutek was a fizzle, and what might this fizzle mean?

I take it to mean that we can expect no spectacular miracles from the heavens, that the problems of ordinary human beings will have to be solved by ordinary human beings. The message of Kahoutek is: “Help is not on the way. Repeat: help is not on the way.”

What about visitors from other planets, who are supposed to be so smart? A lot of people believe that they have already been here, and that they taught us how to build pyramids. One that that even the Egyptians can agree on, I think, is that we don’t need any more pyramids.

As an ordinary person, appalled as I am by the speed with which we are wrecking our topsoil, our drinking water, and our atmosphere, I will suggest an idea about good and evil which might fit into a modern and simple moral code. Evil disgusts us. Good fills us with joy and brings a sparkle to our eyes. That much remains the same. Might we not go farther, though, and say that anything which wounds the planet is evil, and anything which preserves it or heals it is good. Some of you are eager to tell me what is wrong with this, I’m sure, even though it might help to guarantee that your grandchildren had a hospitable planet to live on.

Let me be the first to say that the idea is sappy, whatever that means. I think it has something to do with being concerned about grandchildren, and the hell with them. But the worst thing about my moral code is that it invites people to have the fun of being glamorously wicked at first, which many of us feel is sexy, and then becoming almost swooningly virtuous at the end. This comes close to being the biography of Saint Augustine, and of several other famous holy men.

On a larger scale, entire nations love to blow the hell out of other nations, and then to come like angels to pass out glass eyes and artificial limbs and Hershey bars and all that, to rebuild everything, to get everything going again.

We would have to understand from the first the scientific fact that any wound we inflict on the life support systems of this planet is likely to be quite permanent. So anyone who wounded the planet, and then pretended to heal it, would simply be another hypocrite. He would remain quite permanently an evil and therefore disgusting human being.

I went to a Unitarian church for a while, and it might show. The minister said one Easter Sunday that, if we listened closely to the bell on our church, we would hear that it was singing, over and over again, “No hell, no hell, no hell.” No matter what we did in life, he said, we wouldn’t burn throughout eternity in hell. We wouldn’t even fry for ten or fifteen minutes. He was just guessing, of course.

Jimmy Breslin, on the other hand, told me one time that he sort of hankered to get back into Catholicism, because he thought there were a lot of people who deserved to roast in hell. Maybe so.

At any rate, I don’t think anybody ever dreaded hell as much as most of us dread the contempt of our fellow men. Under our new and heartfelt moral code, we might be able to horrify would-be evildoers with just that: the contempt of their fellow men.

For that contempt to be effective, though, we would need cohesive communities, which are about as common as bald eagles these days. And it is curious that such communities should be so rare, since human beings are genetically such gregarious creatures. They need plenty of like-minded friends and relatives almost as much as they need B complex vitamins and a heart-felt moral code.

I know Sargent Shriver slightly. When he was campaigning for Vice President, he asked me if I had any ideas. You remember there was plenty of money around, but, as far as ideas went, both parties were in a state of destitution. So I told him, and I am afraid he didn’t listen, that the number one American killer wasn’t cardio-vascular disease, but loneliness. I told him that he and McGovern could swamp the Republicans if they would promise to cure that disease. I even gave him a slogan to put on buttons and flags and billboards: “Lonesome no more!”

The rest is history.

I was in Biafra several years ago, at the bitter end of the Nigerian Civil War. The Biafrans had nothing to eat, you’ll remember. They were blockaded, so no food got in. They had almost nothing to fight with, expect for some Mauser rifles which were a good deal older than I was. And still they fought on. They had no recruiting program. There was no scheme for the relief of refugees, and needed none. The government did nothing to look out after the old, the sick, either. Biafra, for the short time it lasted, could be admired simultaneously by both anarchists and conservatives.

The people could look out for each other, without any help from the central government, because every Biafran was a member of an extended family. He had hundreds of relatives he knew by name and reputation. Some Biafrans had thousands of relatives or more.

Those families took care of their own wounded, their own lunatics, their own refugees. They shared equally whatever they had. The government didn’t have to send a policeman to make sure the food was divided fairly. When the government needed new soldiers, it told each family how many recruits it was expected to send. The family decided then who was to go.

And this admirable scheme was far from being an invention by the Biafrans. They were simply continuing to live as human beings have lived until recently.

I have seen the past, and it works.

We should return to extended families as quickly as we can, and be lonesome no more, lonesome no more.

Some of you will become leaders, although that is now thought to be a grungy destiny. Nobody wants to be Papa any more. If you do have to lead, you may imagine that your mission is to help us find an amazing future. You should consider the possibility that you could serve the people better if you were to lead them intelligently and imaginatively back to some of the more humane and comforting institutions of the past.

It seems certain that you will face plenty of social unrest in the future, and demands will continue to be made for economic justice. You will be very shrewd leaders indeed if you recognize that the people are in fact crying out not so much for money as for relief from loneliness.

Let me beguile you just a little bit more about extended families. Let us talk about divorce, and that fact that one out of every three of us here has been or will be divorced. When we do it, we will very likely wrangle and wail and weep formlessly about money and sex, about treachery, about outgrowing one another, about how close love is to hate, and so on. Nobody ever gets anywhere near close to the truth, which is this: the nuclear family doesn’t provide nearly enough companionship.

I am going to write a play about the breakup of a marriage, and at the end of the play I am going to have a character say what people should say to each other in real life at the end of a marriage: “I’m sorry. You, being human, need a hundred different affectionate and like-minded companions. I’m only one person. I’ve tried, but I could never be a hundred people to you. You’ve tried, but you could never be a hundred people to me. Too bad. Goodbye.”

Let’s talk about the incompatibility between parents and children, which happens often merely because of genetic rotten luck. In a nuclear family, children and parents can be locked in hellish close combat for twenty-one years and more. In an extended family, a child has scores of other homes to go to in search of love and understanding. He need not stay home and torture his parents, and he need not starve for love.

In an extended family, anybody can bug out of his own house for months, and still be among relatives. Nobody has to go on a hopeless quest for friendly strangers, which is what most Americans have to do.

Massage parlors come to mind – bus stations and bars.

You graduates here are leaving an artificial extended family now. Even if you hated it here, you will find a nuclear family to be a very poor substitute for what you had here. As for those of us who have come to praise you for having graduated: we have fled here from loneliness, to be part of an artificial extended family for just a little while.

And what we will all be seeking when we decamp, and for the rest of our lives, will be large, stable communities of like-minded people, which is to say relatives. They no longer exist. The lack of them is not only the main cause, but probably the only cause of our shapeless discontent in the midst of such prosperity.

We thought we could do without tribes and clans. Well, we can’t.

There was a time when I was avid to invent new religions and social orders. It is now penetrated my skull that such schemes will not work without the support of huge gruesome police forces and prison systems, unless they are allowed to invent themselves. The Emperor Constantine did not, after all, invent anything. He had many religions to choose from. He selected Christianity because it seemed to him to be most refreshing.

Hitler and Lenin and some others have also tried to refresh their people with ideas that had been around a while. They chose abominably, as we know. It matters what we choose. And history and the deteriorating physical and moral environments are now telling us what we would rather not hear, what we would rather our children or grandchildren would hear: It is our turn to choose.

At least we do not have to choose between various theories of magic, of ways to manipulate God and the Devil and whatever, which is what our ancestors had to do. We no longer believe that God causes earthquakes and crop failures and plagues when he gets mad at us. We no longer imagine that he can be cooled off by sacrifices and festivals and gifts. I am so glad we don’t have to think up presents for Him anymore. What’s the perfect gift for someone who has everything?

The perfect gift for somebody who has everything, of course, is nothing. Any gifts we have should be given to creatures right on the surface of the planet, it seems to me. If God gets angry about that, we can call in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There’s a very good chance they can calm him down.

The new moral code we choose may already have martyrs. It is difficult to spot such things. One corpse tends to look pretty much like another one – until the historians sort them out with the benefit of hindsight.

We shall see what we shall see.

For two-thirds of my life I have been a pessimist. I am astonished to find myself an optimist now. I feel now that I have been underestimating the intelligence and resourcefulness of man. I honestly thought that we were so stupid that we would continue to tear the planet to pieces, to sell it to each other, to burn it up. I’ve never expected thermo-nuclear war. What seemed certain to me was that we would simply gobble up the planet out of boredom and greed, not in centuries, but in ten or twenty years.

Kilgore Trout wrote a science-fiction story called the Planet Gobblers one time. It was about us, and we were the terrors of the universe. We were sort of inter-planetary termites. We would arrive on a planet, gobble it up, and die. But before we died, we always sent out space ships to start tiny colonies elsewhere. We were a disease, since it was not necessary to inhabit planets with such horrifying destructiveness. It is easy to take good care of a planet.

Our grandchildren will surely think of us as Planet Gobblers. Poorer nations than America think of America as a Planet Gobbler right now. But that is going to change. There is welling up with in us a willingness to say, “No, thank you,” to our factories. We were once maniacs for possessions, imagining that they would somehow moderate or somehow compensate us for our loneliness.

The experiment has been tried in this most affluent nation in all of human history. Possessions help a little, but not as much as the advertisers said they were supposed to, and we are now aware of how permanently the manufacture of some of those products hurts the planet.

So there is a willingness to do without them.

There is a willingness to do whatever we need to do in order to have life on the planet go on for a long, long time. I didn’t used to think that. And that willingness has to be a religious enthusiasm, since it celebrates life, since it calls for meaningful sacrifices.

This is bad news for business, as we know it now. It should be thrilling news for persons who love to teach and lead. And thank God we have solid information in the place of superstition! Thank God we are beginning to dream of human communities which are designed to harmonize with what human beings really need and are.

And now I say you have just heard an atheist thank God not once, but twice.

God Bless the class of 1974.

During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a piece of rhinoceros horn would increase potency.  (Another crazy idea of the Middle Ages is these hats we have on today—which is too loose in my case.)  Then a method was discovered for separating the ideas—which was to try one to see if it worked, and if it didn’t work, to eliminate it.  This method became organized, of course, into science.  And it developed very well, so that we are now in the scientific age.  It is such a scientific age, in fact, that we have difficulty in understanding how­ witch doctors could ever have existed, when nothing that they proposed ever really worked—or very little of it did.

But even today I meet lots of people who sooner or later get me into a conversation about UFO’s, or astrology, or some form of mysticism, expanded consciousness, new types of awareness, ESP, and so forth.  And I’ve concluded that it’s not a scientific world. 

Most people believe so many wonderful things that I decided to investigate why they did.  And what has been referred to as my curiosity for investigation has landed me in a difficulty where I found so much junk to talk about that I can’t do it in this talk.  I’m overwhelmed.  First I started out by investigating various ideas of mysticism, and mystic experiences.  I went into isolation tanks (they’re dark and quiet and you float in Epsom salts) and got many hours of hallucinations, so I know something about that.  Then I went to Esalen, which is a hotbed of this kind of thought (it’s a wonderful place; you should go visit there). Then I became overwhelmed. I didn’t realize how much there was.

I was sitting, for example, in a hot bath and there’s another guy and a girl in the bath.  He says to the girl, “I’m learning massage and I wonder if I could practice on you?”  She says OK, so she gets up on a table and he starts off on her foot—working on her big toe and pushing it around.  Then he turns to what is apparently his instructor, and says, “I feel a kind of dent.  Is that the pituitary?”  And she says, “No, that’s not the way it feels.” I say, “You’re a hell of a long way from the pituitary, man.”  And they both looked at me—I had blown my cover, you see—and she said, “It’s reflexology.”  So I closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating. 

That’s just an example of the kind of things that overwhelm me.  I also looked into extrasensory perception and PSI phenomena, and the latest craze there was Uri Geller, a man who is supposed to be able to bend keys by rubbing them with his finger.  So I went to his hotel room, on his invitation, to see a demonstration of both mind reading and bending keys.  He didn’t do any mind reading that succeeded; nobody can read my mind, I guess.  And my boy held a key and Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened.  Then he told us it works better under water, and so you can picture all of us standing in the bathroom with the water turned on and the key under it, and him rubbing the key with his finger.  Nothing happened.  So I was unable to investigate that phenomenon.

But then I began to think, what else is there that we believe?  (And I thought then about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have been to check on them by noticing that nothing really worked.)  So I found things that even more people believe, such as that we have some knowledge of how to educate.  There are big schools of reading methods and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice, you’ll see the reading scores keep going down—or hardly going up—in spite of the fact that we continually use these same people to improve the methods.  There’s a witch doctor remedy that doesn’t work.  It ought to be looked into: how do they know that their method should work?  Another example is how to treat criminals.  We obviously have made no progress—lots of theory, but no progress—in decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to handle criminals.

Yet these things are said to be scientific.  We study them.  And I think ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience.  A teacher who has some good idea of how to teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it some other way—or is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her method is not necessarily a good one.  Or a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or another, feels guilty for the rest of her life because she didn’t do “the right thing,” according to the experts.

So we really ought to look into theories that don’t work, and science that isn’t science.

I tried to find a principle for discovering more of these kinds of things, and came up with the following system.  Any time you find yourself in a conversation at a cocktail party—in which you do not feel uncomfortable that the hostess might come around and say, “Why are you fellows talking shop?’’ or that your wife will come around and say, “Why are you flirting again?”—then you can be sure you are talking about something about which nobody knows anything.

Using this method, I discovered a few more topics that I had forgotten—among them the efficacy of various forms of psychotherapy.  So I began to investigate through the library, and so on, and I have so much to tell you that I can’t do it at all.  I will have to limit myself to just a few little things.  I’ll concentrate on the things more people believe in.  Maybe I will give a series of speeches next year on all these subjects.  It will take a long time.

I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call Cargo Cult Science.  In the South Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people.  During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now.  So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he’s the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land.  They’re doing everything right.  The form is perfect.  It looks exactly the way it looked before.  But it doesn’t work.  No airplanes land.  So I call these things Cargo Cult Science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land.

Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they’re missing.  But it would he just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea Islanders how they have to arrange things so that they get some wealth in their system.  It is not something simple like telling them how to improve the shapes of the earphones.  But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in Cargo Cult Science.  That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school—we never explicitly say what this is, but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation.  It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.  It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them.  You must do the best you can—if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it.  If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it.  There is also a more subtle problem.  When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.

The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example, with advertising.  Last night I heard that Wesson Oil doesn’t soak through food.  Well, that’s true.  It’s not dishonest; but the thing I’m talking about is not just a matter of not being dishonest, it’s a matter of scientific integrity, which is another level.  The fact that should be added to that advertising statement is that no oils soak through food, if operated at a certain temperature.  If operated at another temperature, they all will—including Wesson Oil.  So it’s the implication which has been conveyed, not the fact, which is true, and the difference is what we have to deal with.

We’ve learned from experience that the truth will out.  Other experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong or right.  Nature’s phenomena will agree or they’ll disagree with your theory.  And, although you may gain some temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven’t tried to be very careful in this kind of work.  And it’s this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in Cargo Cult Science.

A great deal of their difficulty is, of course, the difficulty of the subject and the inapplicability of the scientific method to the subject.  Nevertheless, it should be remarked that this is not the only difficulty.  That’s why the planes don’t land—but they don’t land.

We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves.  One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right.  It’s a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air.  It’s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan.  If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan’s, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.

Why didn’t they discover that the new number was higher right away?  It’s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it’s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan’s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong.  When they got a number closer to Millikan’s value they didn’t look so hard.  And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.  We’ve learned those tricks nowadays, and now we don’t have that kind of a disease.

But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves—of having utter scientific integrity—is, I’m sorry to say, something that we haven’t specifically included in any particular course that I know of.  We just hope you’ve caught on by osmosis.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.  So you have to be very careful about that.  After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists.  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that. 

I would like to add something that’s not essential to the science, but something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the layman when you’re talking as a scientist. I’m not trying to tell you what to do about cheating on your wife, or fooling your girlfriend, or something like that, when you’re not trying to be a scientist, but just trying to be an ordinary human being.  We’ll leave those problems up to you and your rabbi.  I’m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist.  And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.

For example, I was a little surprised when I was talking to a friend who was going to go on the radio.  He does work on cosmology and astronomy, and he wondered how he would explain what the applications of this work were.  “Well,” I said, “there aren’t any.”  He said, “Yes, but then we won’t get support for more research of this kind.”  I think that’s kind of dishonest.  If you’re representing yourself as a scientist, then you should explain to the layman what you’re doing—and if they don’t want to support you under those circumstances, then that’s their decision.

One example of the principle is this: If you’ve made up your mind to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out.  If we only publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good.  We must publish both kinds of result.  For example—let’s take advertising again—suppose some particular cigarette has some particular property, like low nicotine.  It’s published widely by the company that this means it is good for you—they don’t say, for instance, that the tars are a different proportion, or that something else is the matter with the cigarette.  In other words, publication probability depends upon the answer.  That should not be done.

I say that’s also important in giving certain types of government advice. Supposing a senator asked you for advice about whether drilling a hole should be done in his state; and you decide it would he better in some other state.  If you don’t publish such a result, it seems to me you’re not giving scientific advice.  You’re being used.  If your answer happens to come out in the direction the government or the politicians like, they can use it as an argument in their favor; if it comes out the other way, they don’t publish it at all.  That’s not giving scientific advice.

Other kinds of errors are more characteristic of poor science.  When I was at Cornell.  I often talked to the people in the psychology department.  One of the students told me she wanted to do an experiment that went something like this—I don’t remember it in detail, but it had been found by others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A.  She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do, A.  So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A. 

I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person—to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A—and then change to Y and see if A changed.  Then she would know that the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control.

She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor.  And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time.  This was in about 1935 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the conditions and see what happens.

Nowadays there’s a certain danger of the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics.  I was shocked to hear of an experiment done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium.  In order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen to light hydrogen he had to use data from someone else’s experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on different apparatus.  When asked he said it was because he couldn’t get time on the program (because there’s so little time and it’s such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldn’t be any new result.  And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are destroying—possibly—the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of the thing.  It is often hard for the experimenters there to complete their work as their scientific integrity demands.

All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however.  For example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on—with little clear result.  But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one.  He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was.  He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off.  No.  The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.

The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before?  Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors.  So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same.  Still the rats could tell.  Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run.  Still the rats could tell.  Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person.  So he covered the corridor, and, still the rats could tell.

He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it.  And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand.  So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door.  If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.

Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-Number-l experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat is really using—not what you think it’s using.  And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.

I looked into the subsequent history of this research.  The subsequent experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young.  They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful.  They just went right on running rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn’t discover anything about the rats.  In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats.  But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic of Cargo Cult Science.

Another example is the ESP experiments of Mr. Rhine, and other people.  As various people have made criticisms—and they themselves have made criticisms of their own experiments—they improve the techniques so that the effects are smaller, and smaller, and smaller until they gradually disappear.  All the parapsychologists are looking for some experiment that can be repeated—that you can do again and get the same effect—statistically, even.  They run a million rats—no, it’s people this time—they do a lot of things and get a certain statistical effect.  Next time they try it they don’t get it any more.  And now you find a man saying that it is an irrelevant demand to expect a repeatable experiment.  This is science?

This man also speaks about a new institution, in a talk in which he was resigning as Director of the Institute of Parapsychology.  And, in telling people what to do next, he says that one of the things they have to do is be sure they only train students who have shown their ability to get PSI results to an acceptable extent—not to waste their time on those ambitious and interested students who get only chance results.  It is very dangerous to have such a policy in teaching—to teach students only how to get certain results, rather than how to do an experiment with scientific integrity.

So I wish to you—I have no more time, so I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity.  May you have that freedom.  May I also give you one last bit of advice: Never say that you’ll give a talk unless you know clearly what you’re going to talk about and more or less what you’re going to say.

President Breneman, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, the members of the Class of 1988. First of all I have to say Don, that whatever benefit I derived in my ego from that citation that you read was at the cost of severe damage to your credibility to your colleagues here, but I thank you for that.

For those of you who were here two years ago, I am very tempted to say that I bring greetings from my absent colleague, Henry Fairley. He is working on his transportation arrangements and confidently expects to join one of these commencements. For those of you who were not here, let me tell you what an act of charity it is for Kalamazoo College to invite another journalist to be a commencement speaker after Mr. Fairley did one of the classic no shows, demonstrating once again that journalists are basically pretty irresponsible people.

I want to add my personal word of congratulations to you graduates of the Class of 1988, to your families, your friends, your faculty members, and to all of those who have begged and borrowed and coaxed and coached to get you to this proud moment. It is a proud moment and I'm proud that you invited me to be a part of it. I am also cognizant of how modest my part is. It's ten years now since I gave my first commencement talk. On that occasion I went to a wise and experienced Washington figure who had probably done one hundred or two hundred commencement addresses. I confessed my nervousness and asked for his advice. He said, in that wonderfully measured pace that I cannot imitate, but which his legal clients pay dearly to hear, "David, I can understand your trepidation, but it is wholly unnecessary. You may say anything you wish with the absolute security that no one will remember a word of it. They are not there to hear you. So I advise you to keep your remarks brief." My experience has confirmed his wisdom and I intend to live up to his advice.

I have very pleasant memories of the week that I spent on this campus thirteen years ago under the auspices of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, and I don't want to foul up or delay today's celebrations. My other reason for being brief, frankly, is that I have come to you fresh from the Presidential primary campaign trail and I cannot stand to listen to another long speech, let alone deliver one. I thought I could probably recycle some wisdom I have heard from those 15 Presidential candidates in the last year, if only I could decide which of them I wanted to steal from. So I thought about what I had learned at their feet, and I thought and I thought and I decided that campaign speeches really aren't that much different from commencement addresses or Chinese food. A half hour later you can't find an idea that you'll stick with. I have no great wisdom to impart. I will just express a few wishes based on the campaign that I've seen. I hope throughout your lives, you are blessed with the originality of a Joe Biden, the unfailing good humor of a Bob Dole, the towering stature of a Michael Dukakis, the ironclad independence of a George Bush, and for those of you who may need it, the discretion of a Gary Hart.

To be a bit more serious, there are a few hopes that I actually do have for you. I hope you'll have the guts to take some chances. After a lifetime of covering politicians, I have not become cynical largely because I continue to admire their willingness to put themselves on the line. Of course, they have big egos, because ambition is the energy that fuels our competitive political system, just as it does our economy. But it takes guts to submit yourself to the kind of very public judgment that an election involves. To enter a contest like the Presidential race where you know in advance that 14 of the 15 entrants are doomed to be losers, or at the very least run the hazard of the worse fate of winding up as vice president.

In a modest way, I suppose I take a chance every day of my life as a journalist, because I know in advance that any story to which I sign my name has to look ridiculous in the eyes of those people who know much more than I can possibly know about what is really going on. It's only because some of us have the folly to go into print with our partial information and with our hasty, ill considered judgement, that we can start the process of elaboration, correction, explanation, and amendment, which eventually may give our readers a fairly realistic impression of what is taking place.

So, I hope you'll take some risks, even on the choice of a career. Don't feel that you've got to get on the fast track to success right this minute to meet your family's expectations or to start repaying your student loans. Indulge your instincts a bit. Try something just because it feels right to you. Mistakes in your 20's are not irreparable; they're part of your education and probably the most valuable part. Sometimes they don't tum out to be mistakes. It was greatly to the dismay of my parents that I tried newspaper work when I got out of the army 35 years ago. That is not what they had in mind for me at all. I told them and I really believed that it was something I needed to get out of my system before I grew up and looked for a real job. Well, its taken longer than I expected and I've loved every wasted minute of it.

My second hope would be that you set high standards for yourselves. They have to be your standards. They can't be somebody else's or they won't mean anything to you. I believe in apprenticeship, at least for reporters, in learning the craft on the job. And the only bit of advice that I give to young people that come by the Post is to promise that they will not apprentice themselves at a paper whose product they do not respect. And I 'd say the same thing to you. Never work below your own level, never work for people whose behavior suggests that they are ready to accept second best. Probably the single most meaningful line that I heard from any of the candidates this year was the one that Jesse Jackson uttered every time he was on a college campus or in a high school gym or auditorium.

He would say, "You have not earned the right to do less than your best." Think about that statement. You have not earned the right to do less than your best. The notion that rights are something that have to be earned, not given, is itself controversial. We speak of inalienable rights, of rights deriving from the creator, or from the law of nature. Whatever form it may take, do not delude yourselves on that point. Anyone of us may feel entitled to say, "Look I'm lucky, I admit it. I was born into a free and prosperous and peaceful country with advantages that few others enjoy. I've had four years at a top-notch college with people I really like, (or in my case 21 years on a terrific paper covering the stories I really wanted to cover). I'm sorry everybody else doesn't get the same breaks, but by gosh since they've come my way, I'm sure going to enjoy them."

Can we enjoy them? Absolutely. We'd be fools not to. Can we forget that we have not earned the right to slack off because of those breaks? Absolutely not. We cannot assert the right to do less than our best with the opportunities we have been given without demeaning those who gave them to us and without reducing the chance that those who come after us will have fewer such opportunities in their lives. Why do I have the opportunity to do a job I love at the Washington Post? Well, it's the happy convergence of a hundred different accidents. I'll mention just a couple. I have that chance because an entrepreneur named Eugene Meyer had the wisdom and the guts to buy a failing newspaper in the depths of the Depression and keep that newspaper alive; because his daughter, Katherine Graham, reacted to the suicide death of her publisher husband, not by going to pieces, not by turning over the responsibility to others for running her father's newspaper, but by stepping up to that challenge herself and telling her editors she wanted it to be the best paper it could be. I also had that opportunity because my father, who was an immigrant from Poland, learned enough of the English language to work his way through dental school; because he worked in his walk-up dental office in an industrial town in Illinois from breakfast to dinner, 6 days a week, and on five nights went back to that office after dinner to wait to see if other patients might come in; because when those patients did not have money to pay for dentistry, as was often the case during the Depression, he worked out barter deals with them and kept his family in food and clothing that way. Those are the sum of the reasons I have not earned the right to do less than my best.

I expect that with a moment's thought each of you could quickly identify the circumstances in your own life which have made it possible for you to reach this moment of achievement. It's not only permissible, it's desirable for you to ponder those circumstances, to acknowledge the depths that you owe to others whose sacrifices you would demean if you permitted yourself to do less than your best. Frankly, your time will be much better spent thinking on that subject then in listening to the words

I have to say now in concluding this talk.

It's traditional in commencement speeches to quote an authority. My authority is the man who was Chancellor of the University of Chicago when my wife and I graduated, approximately one century ago. His name was Robert Maynard Hutchins. He did not waste his words on us when we graduated, but on another occasion when we might remember, he said something that struck me so forcibly that for years I carried a transcript of it around in my wallet. Hutchins asked,"How is the educated man or woman to show the fruits of his education in times like these?" He said he must cling fast to his faith in freedom and insist that freedom is the chief glory of mankind. He must not commit injustice or acquiesce when he sees it done by others. He must assert at whatever cost that any threat to freedom is an effort to repress the human spirit itself. After 35 years in journalism, a trade which exists only where freedom prevails, I've heard no better definition of the special responsibility of those who, like you, have received the blessings of a liberal education. 

This is a great time to be graduating. You come out into a world where the scent of freedom has spread literally from pole to pole. Where people in remote villages of China, South Africa, of Mexico and Guatemala, and Nicaragua, and of the Soviet Union, and of a hundred other countries, have caught a glimpse of the glories that we know freedom brings. You and your country can be an example, can be an inspiration and a direct source of assistance to those millions. I hope you'll cherish that gift of freedom and help extend it to others who are reaching out for it. Take some chances. Set high standards for yourselves and if you recall any of these superfluous words, remember this: none of us has earned the right to do less than our best. 

Thank you. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Ladd. Dr. Alexander, my good friend Congressman Ralph Metcalfe, Reverend Martin, distinguished graduates--which I am now proud partner with you--your honored parents and friends, ladies and gentlemen:

I am distinctly honored by the action taken by Dr. Alexander, and I will forever remember the opportunity to be an associate with all of you in the class of July 1975, and I thank you very much.

It is perfectly obvious that I am delighted with your invitation and the opportunity to be here at the commencement exercises of beautiful Chicago University. You know, that is what I admire so much about Dr. Alexander. He not only tells it like it is but also like it better be.

Even during this very brief visit with all of you today, I can see that this graduating class has, excluding myself, talent, vision, ambition, and a sense of humor as well.

I asked one of the graduating students here today, "What inspired your school symbol, that symbol you have of a black hand and a white hand clasped together. Does it symbolize the brotherhood of learning?" He said, "No, Mr. President. The clasped hands have an entirely different meaning. After a big rainstorm, that is a black student and a white student helping each other to get from the university center to their classes."

I was so deeply moved by the more than 5,000 signatures on the petition inviting me that no rainstorm could have kept me away. I was impressed not only by the great number of signatures but also by the Chicago State University success story.

CSU serves the urban needs of a great city. Not long ago, CSU came under heavy attack, but you effectively answered the challenge. Today, CSU is graduating a first-rate and hopeful class of 1975. You have overcome. You can today share a justifiable pride; so can the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, and the entire United States. You have proved the critics wrong.

I know of the sacrifices of your husbands and wives, your parents, your grandparents, yes, even your great grandparents. Some of your guests here today were denied even the opportunity to complete high school, but none can stand taller in American achievement than they do for the inspiring and encouragement that they have given to today's graduates.

To those relatives who never had a chance to attend an institution of higher learning, I say: You have learned the greatest history lesson that the United States of America can teach. You have learned to nourish hope, to sustain belief in a better life for the next generation, to work toward that goal, and now, to experience the proof that the American dream is possible for all.

To the graduates, I say: You have made your loved ones proud; you have made Chicago State University proud. You have made me proud to be President of a nation where graduates like you strive against heavy odds for self-betterment, for equal opportunity, for constructive change, and for excellence; where graduates build on abilities rather than cop out on disabilities; where graduates believe in themselves and in the contribution they can make to their community; and where graduates provide a living demonstration of how we are going to turn around the problems of our great cities.

Chicago State University is a showcase of what can be done by people with determination. You have shown how white and black hands can unite to build a multiracial institution. You have shown academic achievement. And you have responded to the real needs of the community that you serve.

Most of today's graduates had to work full or part time on outside jobs, and if I might, I would like to share a personal experience. As a freshman at the University of Michigan, I worked as a busboy in the nurses' cafeteria at the university hospital. I also waited on tables in the interns' dining room. I will say, parenthetically, I liked the first job better.

But let me add very quickly that even during the Great Depression it was much easier for me. I was not the victim of racial prejudice nor of a deprived environment. So, I cannot honestly say that my experiences were the same as that of those who are struggling today in Chicago and elsewhere in an effort to make it. But I do say that my own personal experience leads me to care about and to identify with every upward-bound individual in this great Nation.

I defy anyone to put down the greatest fraternity of them all--the college graduates who learned something about life by dirtying their hands.

I am deeply concerned about the unemployment of this recession and those now employed beneath the level of their capacities. A nation that deprives anyone of equal opportunity is itself deprived. A nation that cannot create the conditions for human dignity for all is itself lacking a measure of humanity and dignity.

The dignity of the individual is based ultimately on a sense of pride. It does not come from government programs that take over the individual's life and reduce the person to a case file and a claim number. Real aid to the individual is aid that helps the individual to help himself or herself. Federal assistance that helps people achieve higher education and higher qualification is fully justified, because that is the aim and that is the objective.

I am told that one of your graduates here today receiving a degree in education is a 45-year-old woman who worked as a teacher's aide. She aspired to teach. With nine children--one severely handicapped--it was obviously not easy. But her perseverance is typical of this entire graduating class. So is the spirit of your Vietnam veterans and others who caught up to win degrees today.

The Federal Government can provide financial aid to education, but it cannot give individuals the determination that you have displayed in earning your degrees.

As President, I am deeply concerned about the attitude of government toward individuals. But I am also concerned about the attitude of individuals toward the national community and toward themselves in terms of personal self-respect.

I cannot and I do not say that we are all in the same boat. Some people, unfortunately, are outside the boat, so to speak, struggling in stormy waters. We, the fortunate, are in the boat and can throw out--for illustrative purposes, I say--a life preserver. We can and we will help. But those in the water must not just hang on indefinitely to their life preservers, but must swim toward rescue.

Real assistance is to help people to help themselves. We can't do everything for everybody, but there is room for all who try to make it. The only soul really lost is the one who gives up without trying.

Many of the problems, for example, of cities remain unsolved. And I should say with great emphasis, I am dedicated to turning around the trend of deterioration and despair, of crime and unemployment, of pollution and bad housing, and of drugs and premature death. But I am also dedicated to the conviction that local problems must, in the final analysis, be solved by local people. The Federal Government has helped and will continue to help.

Frankly, that is why I came to Chicago today to meet you. We in Washington can learn a great deal from you. Many of you have overcome a deprived environment and economic limitations. You succeeded because you are rich in human capacities and have the love of families who care. This auditorium is filled with individual success stories. I don't see any reason whatsoever to worry about the class of 1975 at CSU.

But I am concerned about the future of some other young Americans who are today neither in school nor working at jobs. Tragically, they are on the streets. Some have lost hope and motivation to the extent that they no longer are even looking for work or education. Some, tragically, have police records.

Society has begun to think of them as records and public enemies rather than as human beings in trouble. Some are sick with addiction to drugs because they are so empty inside, so devoid of hope that they fill themselves with artificial illusions of contentment.

So, I challenge today's graduates to use your new skills to help the people who are not in this hall today. You are uniquely equipped. I challenge the graduates in education to teach young people how to read and how to write. I challenge the graduates in the liberal arts to stimulate the mind and to inspire the spirit. I challenge the graduates in corrections and law enforcement to counsel and to motivate individuals from the path or paths of destruction of themselves and others. I challenge the business and administration graduates to conceive of new jobs that are more interesting, challenging, and rewarding. I challenge all graduates to set an example that gives hope to the millions who have not yet made it.

You have demonstrated by your own achievements and accomplishments that your determination can make a significant difference. You might have been part of the problem, but now you are part of the pride, and I congratulate you.

CSU has shown that a new tradition can emerge from problem areas. Your president, Dr. Alexander, made CSU a school that demands performance of its students. He made CSU a school where you shape up or ship out.

I agree with the CSU philosophy. You kill pride if students are passed merely because they come from disadvantaged backgrounds. That is no favor. It is a disservice. You sacrifice for an education, and consequently, you are entitled to a fair chance to learn. CSU is not a school where the student can coast blithefully through for 4 years and emerge with a degree but without competence.

The pursuit of excellence makes more valid the diplomas you are receiving today. It is a service to the university, to. the students, and to the community. You welcomed the challenge, and you made the grade.

A united America requires opportunities for all citizens and the cooperation of all races and all groups in our society. That is why I draw such encouragement from the achievements of this graduating class, and I am delighted to be a part of it even though I am not sure I earned it. You are the individuals who will provide new energy, new ideas, and new leadership to help resolve the plight of the cities.

If I can go once more to the days when I was going through high school and college, there was a poem by a Victorian Englishman that was a favorite of commencement orators at that time. Frankly, I heard it recited so many times that I think I still may know it by heart.

The last part went something like this, and I quote:

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll;

I am the master of my fate;

I am the captain of my soul.

Those sentiments served my generation, but maybe they sound a little old-fashioned today. I don't know whether that is true or untrue, but I do know this: America is a far better place today than it was when I graduated from college 40 years ago. Because of you, and because of your determination, I do believe in a better tomorrow for all Americans.

Thank you.

For this convocation, I planned to separate my remarks into two parts: some thoughts about you, the women students here, and some thoughts about us who teach in a women's college. But ultimately those two parts are indivisible. If university education means anything beyond the processing of human beings into expected roles, through credit hours, tests, and grades (and I believe that in a women's college especially it might mean much more), it implies an ethical and intellectual contract between teacher and student. This contract must remain intuitive, dynamic, unwritten; but we must turn to it again and again if learning is to be reclaimed from the depersonalizing and cheapening pressures of the present-day academic scene.

The first thing I want to say to you who are students, is that you cannot afford to think of being here to receive an education: you will do much better to think of being here to claim one. One of the dictionary definitions of the verb "to claim" is: to take as the rightful owner; to assert in the face of possible contradiction. "To receive" is to come into possession of: to act as receptacle or container for; to accept as authoritative or true. The difference is that between acting and being acted-upon, and for women it can literally mean the difference between life and death.

One of the devastating weaknesses of university learning, of the store of knowledge and opinion that has been handed down through academic training, has been its almost total erasure of women's experience and thought from the curriculum, and its exclusion of women as members of the academic community. Today, with increasing numbers of women students in nearly every  branch of higher learning, we still see very few women in the upper levels of faculty and administration in most institutions. Douglass College itself is a women's college in a university administered overwhelmingly men, who in turn are answerable to the state legislature, again composed predominantly of men. But the most, significant fact for you is that what you learn here, the very texts you read, the lectures you hear, the way your studies are divided into categories and fragmented one from the other -- all this reflects, to a very large degree, neither objective reality, nor an accurate picture of the past, nor a group of rigorously tested observations about human behavior. What you can learn here (and I mean not only at Douglass but any college in any university) is how men have perceived and organized their experience, their history, their ideas of social relationships, good and evil, sickness and health, etc. When you read or hear about "great issues," "major texts," "the mainstream of Western thought," you are hearing about what men, above all white men, in their male subjectivity, have decided is important.

Black and other minority peoples have for some time recognized that their racial and ethnic experience was not accounted for in the studies broadly labeled human: and that even the sciences can be racist. For many reasons, it has been more difficult for women to comprehend our exclusion, and to realize that even the sciences can be sexist. For one thing, it is only within the last hundred years that higher education has grudgingly been opened up to women at all, even to white, middle-class women. And many of us have found ourselves poring eagerly over books with title like: The Descent of Man: Man and His Symbols: Irrational Man: The Phenomenon of Man: The Future of Man: Man and the Machine: From Man to Man: May Man Prevail?: Man, Science and Society: or One Dimensional Man --books pretending to describe a "human" reality that does not include over one-half the human species.

Less than a decade ago, with the rebirth of a feminist movement in this country, women students and teachers in a number of universities began to demand and set up women's studies courses -- to claim a women-directed education. And, despite the inevitable accusations of "unscholarly," "group therapy," "faddism," etc., despite backlash and budget cuts, woman's studies are still growing, offering to more and more women a new intellectual grasp on their lives, new understanding of our history, a fresh vision of the human experience, and also a critical basis for evaluating what they hear and read in other courses, and in the society at large.

But my talk is not really about women's studies, much as I believe in their scholarly, scientific, and human necessity. While I think that any Douglass student has everything to gain by investigating and enrolling in women's studies courses, I want to suggest that there is a more essential experience that you owe yourselves, one which courses in women's studies can greatly enrich, but which finally depends on you in all your interactions with yourself and your world. This is the experience of taking responsibility toward yourselves. Our upbringing as women has so often told us that this should come second to our relationships and responsibilities to other people. We have been offered ethical models of the self-denying wife and mother; intellectual models of the brilliant but slapdash dilettante who never commits herself to anything the whole way, or the intelligent woman who denies her intelligence in order to seem more "feminine," or who sits in passive silence even when she disagrees inwardly with everything that is being said around her.

Responsibility to yourself means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and naming for you; it means learning to respect and use your own brains and instincts; hence, grappling with hard work. It means that you do not treat your body as a commodity with which to purchase superficial intimacy or economic security; for our bodies to be treated as objects, our  minds are in mortal danger. It means insisting that those to whom you give your friendship and love are able to respect your mind. It means being able to say, with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre: "I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all the extraneous delights should be withheld or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give."

Responsibility to yourself means that you don't fall for shallow and easy solutions-- predigested books and ideas, weekend encounters guaranteed to change your life, taking "gut" courses instead of ones you know will challenge you, bluffing at school and life instead of doing solid work, marrying early as an escape from real decisions, getting pregnant as an evasion of already existing problems. It means that you refuse to sell your talents and aspirations short, simply to avoid conflict and confrontation. And this, in turn, means resisting the forces in society which say that women should be nice, play safe, have low professional expectations, drown in love and forget about work, live through others, and stay in the places assigned to us. It means that we insist on a life of meaningful work, insist that work be as meaningful as love and friendship in our lives. It means, therefore, the courage to be "different"; not to be continuously available to others when we need time for ourselves and our work; to be able to demand of others--parents, friends, roommates, teachers, lovers, husbands, children--that they respect our sense of purpose and our integrity as persons. Women everywhere are finding the courage to do this, more and more, and we are finding that courage both in our study of women in the past who possessed it, and in each other as we look to other women for comradeship, community, and challenge. The difference between a life lived actively, and a life of passive drifting and dispersal of energies, is an immense difference. Once we begin to feel committed to our lives, responsible to ourselves, we can never again be satisfied with the old, passive way.

Now comes the second part of the contract. I believe that in a women's college you have the right to expect your faculty to take you seriously. The education of women has been a matter of debate for centuries, and old, negative attitudes about women's role, women's ability to think and take leadership, are still rife both in and outside the university. Many male professors (and I don't mean only at Douglass) still feel that teaching in a women's college is a second-rate career. Many tend to eroticize their women students--to treat them as sexual objects--instead of demanding the best of their minds. (At Yale a legal suit [Alexander v. Yale] has been brought against the university by a group of women students demanding a stated policy against sexual advances toward female students by male professors.) Many teachers, both men and women, trained in the male-centered tradition, are still handing the ideas and texts of that tradition on to students without teaching them to criticize its antiwoman attitudes, it's omission of women as part of the species. Too often, all of us fail to teach the most important thing, which is that clear thinking, active discussion, and excellent writing are all necessary for intellectual freedom, and that these require hard work. Sometimes, perhaps in discouragement with a culture which is both antiintellectual and antiwoman, we may resign ourselves to low expectations for our students before we have given them half a chance to become more thoughtful, expressive human beings. We need to take to heart the words of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a poet, a thinking woman, and a feminist, who wrote in 1845 of her impatience with studies which cultivate a "passive recipiency" in the mind, and asserted that "women want to be made to think actively: their apprehension is quicker than that of men, but their defect lies for the most part in the logical faculty and in the higher mental activities." Note that she implies a defect which can be remedied by intellectual training; not an inborn lack ability.

I have said that the contract on the student's part involves that you demand to be taken seriously so that you can also go on taking yourself seriously. This means seeking out criticism, recognizing that the most affirming thing anyone can do for you is demand that you push yourself further, show you the range of what you can do. It means rejecting attitudes of "take-iteasy," "why-be-so-serious," "why-worry-you'll-probably-get-married-anyway." It means assuming your share of responsibility for what happens in the classroom, because that affects the quality of your daily life here. It means that the student sees herself engaged with her teachers in active, ongoing struggle for a real education. But for her to do this, her teachers must be committed to belief that women's minds and experience are intrinsically valuable and indispensable to any civilization worthy the name: that there is no more exhilarating and intellectually fertile place in the academic world today than a women's college -- if both students and teachers in large enough numbers are trying to fulfill this contract. The contract is really a pledge of mutual seriousness about women, about language, ideas, method, and values. It is our shared commitment toward a world in which the inborn potentialities of so many women's minds will not longer be wasted, raveled-away, paralyzed, or denied.

My uncle ordered popovers
from the restaurant’s bill of fare.
And, when they were served,
he regarded them
with a penetrating stare
Then he spoke great Words of Wisdom
as he sat there on that chair:
“To eat these things,”
said my uncle,
“you must exercise great care.
You may swallow down what’s solid
BUT
you must spit out the air!”

And
as you partake of the world’s bill of fare,
that’s darned good advice to follow.
Do a lot of spitting out the hot air.
And be careful what you swallow.

I am sincerely happy to be here on the occasion of the 327th commencement of this old and most prestigious university. My congratulations and very best wishes to all of today's graduates.

Harvard's motto is "VERITAS." Many of you have already found out, and others will find out in the course of their lives, that truth eludes us if we do not concentrate our attention totally on it's pursuit. But even while it eludes us, the illusion of knowing it still lingers and leads to many misunderstandings. Also, truth seldom is pleasant; it is almost invariably bitter. There is some bitterness in my today's speech too, but I want to stress that it comes not from an adversary, but from a friend.

Three years ago in the United States I said certain things which at that time appeared unacceptable. Today, however, many people agree with what I then said.

The split in today's world is perceptible even to a hasty glance. Any of our contemporaries readily identifies two world powers, each of them already capable of entirely destroying the other. However, understanding of the split often is limited to this political conception: that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces. The truth is that the split is a much [more] profound [one] and a more alienating one, that the rifts are more than one can see at first glance. This deep manifold split bears the danger of manifold disaster for all of us, in accordance with the ancient truth that a kingdom -- in this case, our Earth -- divided against itself cannot stand.

There is the concept of "Third World": thus, we already have three worlds. Undoubtedly, however, the number is even greater; we are just too far away to see. Any ancient and deeply rooted, autonomous culture, especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earth's surface, constitutes an autonomous world, full of riddles and surprises to Western thinking. As a minimum, we must include in this category China, India, the Muslim world, and Africa, if indeed we accept the approximation of viewing the latter two as compact units.

For one thousand years Russia belonged to such a category, although Western thinking systematically committed the mistake of denying its autonomous character and therefore never understood it, just as today the West does not understand Russia in Communist captivity. It may be that in past years Japan has increasingly become a distant part of the West. I am no judge here. But as to Israel, for instance, it seems to me that it's been the part from the western world, in that its state system is fundamentally linked to religion.

How short a time ago, relatively, the small, new European world was easily seizing colonies everywhere, not only without anticipating any real resistance, but also usually despising any possible values in the conquered people's approach to life. On the face of it, it was an overwhelming success. There were no geographic frontiers [limits] to it. Western society expanded in a triumph of human independence and power. And all of a sudden in the 20th century came the discovery of its fragility and friability.

We now see that the conquests proved to be short lived and precarious -- and this, in turn, points to defects in the Western view of the world which led to these conquests. Relations with the former colonial world now have turned into their opposite and the Western world often goes to extremes of subservience, but it is difficult yet to estimate the total size of the bill which former colonial countries will present to the West and it is difficult to predict whether the surrender not only of its last colonies, but of everything it owns, will be sufficient for the West to foot the bill.

But the blindness of superiority continues in spite of all and upholds the belief that the vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day Western systems, which in theory are the best and in practice the most attractive. There is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented (by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity and incomprehension) from taking the way of Western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the Western way of life. Countries are judged on the merit of their progress in this direction.

However, it is a conception which develops out of Western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds, out of the mistake of measuring them all with a Western yardstick. The real picture of our planet's development is quite different and which about our divided world gave birth to the theory of convergence between leading Western countries and the Soviet Union. It is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity. Neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence. Besides, convergence inevitably means acceptance of the other side's defects, too, and this is hardly desirable.

If I were today addressing an audience in my country, examining the overall pattern of the world's rifts, I would have concentrated on the East's calamities. But since my forced exile in the West has now lasted four years and since my audience is a Western one, I think it may be of greater interest to concentrate on certain aspects of the West, in our days, such as I see them.

A decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the West in our days. The Western world has lost its civil courage, both as a whole and separately, in each country, each government, each political party, and, of course, in the United Nations. Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite, causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society. Of course, there are many courageous individuals, but they have no determining influence on public life.

Political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression, passivity, and perplexity in their actions and in their statements, and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic, reasonable, as well as intellectually and even morally worn it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice. And decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and with countries not supported by anyone, or with currents which cannot offer any resistance. But they get tongue-tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces, with aggressors and international terrorists.

Should one point out that from ancient times declining courage has been considered the beginning of the end?

When the modern Western states were created, the principle was proclaimed that governments are meant to serve man and man lives to be free and to pursue happiness. See, for example, the American Declaration of Independence. Now, at last, during past decades technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations: the welfare state.

Every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the achievement of happiness -- in the morally inferior sense of the word which has come into being during those same decades. In the process, however, one psychological detail has been overlooked: the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to attain them imprint many Western faces with worry and even depression, though it is customary to conceal such feelings. Active and tense competition fills all human thoughts without opening a way to free spiritual development.

The individual's independence from many types of state pressure has been guaranteed. The majority of people have been granted well-being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about. It has become possible to raise young people according to these ideals, leaving them to physical splendor, happiness, possession of material goods, money, and leisure, to an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment. So who should now renounce all this? Why? And for what should one risk one's precious life in defense of common values and particularly in such nebulous cases when the security of one's nation must be defended in a distant country? Even biology knows that habitual, extreme safety and well-being are not advantageous for a living organism. Today, well-being in the life of Western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask.

Western society has given itself the organization best suited to its purposes based, I would say, one the letter of the law. The limits of human rights and righteousness are determined by a system of laws; such limits are very broad. People in the West have acquired considerable skill in interpreting and manipulating law. Any conflict is solved according to the letter of the law and this is considered to be the supreme solution. If one is right from a legal point of view, nothing more is required. Nobody will mention that one could still not be entirely right, and urge self-restraint, a willingness to renounce such legal rights, sacrifice and selfless risk. It would sound simply absurd. One almost never sees voluntary self-restraint. Everybody operates at the extreme limit of those legal frames.

I have spent all my life under a Communist regime and I will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed. But a society with no other scale than the legal one is not quite worthy of man either. A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities. The letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society. Whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations, there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity, paralyzing man's noblest impulses. And it will be simply impossible to stand through the trials of this threatening century with only the support of a legalistic structure.

In today's Western society the inequality has been revealed [in] freedom for good deeds and freedom for evil deeds. A statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has to move cautiously and even timidly. There are thousands of hasty and irresponsible critics around him; parliament and the press keep rebuffing him. As he moves ahead, he has to prove that each single step of his is well-founded and absolutely flawless. Actually, an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself. From the very beginning, dozens of traps will be set out for him. Thus, mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of restrictions imposed by democracy.

It is feasible and easy everywhere to undermine administrative power and in fact it has been drastically weakened in all Western countries. The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals. It's time, in the West -- It is time, in the West, to defend not so much human rights as human obligations.

Destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space. Society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence, such as, for example, misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people, such as motion pictures full of pornography, crime, and horror. It is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counterbalanced by the young people's right not to look or not to accept. Life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil.

And what shall we say criminality as such? Legal frames, especially in the United States, are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes. The culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of thousands of public defenders. When a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism, public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorist's civil rights. There are many such cases.

Such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually, but it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature. The world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems, which must be corrected. Strangely enough, though the best social conditions have been achieved in the West, there still is criminality and there even is considerably more of it than in the pauper and lawless Soviet society.

The press too, of course, enjoys the widest freedom. (I shall be using the word press to include all media.) But what sort of use does it make of this freedom?

Here again, the main concern is not to infringe the letter of the law. There is no true moral responsibility for deformation or disproportion. What sort of responsibility does a journalist or a newspaper have to his readers, or to his history -- or to history? If they have misled public opinion or the government by inaccurate information or wrong conclusions, do we know of any cases of public recognition and rectification of such mistakes by the same journalist or the same newspaper? It hardly ever happens because it would damage sales. A nation may be the victim of such a mistake, but the journalist usually always gets away with it. One may -- One may safely assume that he will start writing the opposite with renewed self-assurance.

Because instant and credible information has to be given, it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork, rumors, and suppositions to fill in the voids, and none -- and none of them will ever be rectified; they will stay on in the readers' memories. How many hasty, immature, superficial, and misleading judgments are expressed every day, confusing readers, without any verification. The press -- The press can both simulate public opinion and miseducate it. Thus, we may see terrorists described as heroes, or secret matters  pertaining to one's nation's defense publicly revealed, or we may witness shameless intrusion on the privacy of well-known people under the slogan: "Everyone is entitled to know everything." But this is a false slogan, characteristic of a false era. People also have the right not to know and it's a much more valuable one. The right not to have their divine souls [stuffed with gossip, nonsense, vain talk.] A person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information.

Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic disease of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press. Such as it is, however, the press has become the greatest power within the Western countries, more powerful than the legislative power, the executive, and the judiciary. And one would then like to ask: By what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible? In the communist East a journalist is frankly appointed as a state official. But who has granted Western journalists their power, for how long a time, and with what prerogatives?

There is yet another surprise for someone coming from the East, where the press is rigorously unified. One gradually discovers a common trend of preferences within the Western press as a whole. It is a fashion; there are generally accepted patterns of judgment; there may be common corporate interests, the sum effect being not competition but unification. Enormous freedom exists for the press, but not for the readership because newspaper[s] mostly develop stress and emphasis to those opinions which do not too openly contradict their own and the general trend.

Without any censorship, in the West fashionable trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable; nothing is forbidden, but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges. Legally your researchers are free, but they are conditioned by the fashion of the day. There is no open violence such as in the East; however, a selection dictated by fashion and the need to match mass standards frequently prevent independent-minded people giving their contribution to public life. There is a dangerous tendency to flock together and shut off successful development. I have received letters in America from highly intelligent persons, maybe a teacher in a faraway small college who could do much for the renewal and salvation of his country, but his country cannot hear him because the media are not interested in him. This gives birth to strong mass prejudices, to blindness, which is most dangerous in our dynamic era. There is, for instance, a self-deluding interpretation of the contemporary world situation. It works as a sort of a petrified armor around people's minds. Human voices from 17 countries of Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia cannot pierce it. It will only be broken by the pitiless crowbar of events.

I have mentioned a few traits of Western life which surprise and shock a new arrival to this world. The purpose and scope of this speech will not allow me to continue such a review, to look into the influence of these Western characteristics on important aspects of a nation's life, such as elementary education, advanced education in the humanities and art.

It is almost universally recognized that the West shows all the world a way to successful economic development, even though in the past years it has been strongly disturbed by chaotic inflation. However, many people living in the West are dissatisfied with their own society. They despise it or accuse it of not being up to the level of maturity attained by mankind. A number of such critics turn to socialism, which is a false and dangerous current.

I hope that no one present will suspect me of offering my personal criticism of the Western system to present socialism as an alternative. Having experienced -- Having experienced applied socialism in a country where the alternative has been realized, I certainly will not speak for it. The well-known Soviet mathematician Shafarevich, a member of the Soviet Academy of Science, has written a brilliant book under the title Socialism; it is a profound analysis showing that socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into death. Shafarevich's book was published in France -- Shafarevich's book was published in France almost two years ago and so far no one has been found to refute it. It will shortly be published in the United States.

But should someone ask me whether I would indicate the West such as it is today as a model to my country, frankly I would have to answer negatively. No, I could not recommend your society in its present state as an ideal for the transformation of ours. Through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the Western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive. Even those characteristics of your life which I have just mentioned are extremely saddening.

A fact which cannot be disputed is the weakening of human beings in the West while in the East they are becoming firmer and stronger -- 60 years for our people and 30 years for the people of Eastern Europe. During that time we have been through a spiritual training far in advance of Western experience. Life's complexity and mortal weight have produced stronger, deeper, and more interesting characters than those generally [produced] by standardized Western well-being.

Therefore, if our society were to be transformed into yours, it would mean an improvement in certain aspects, but also a change for the worse on some particularly significant scores. It is true, no doubt, that a society cannot remain in an abyss of lawlessness, as is the case in our country. But it is also demeaning for it to elect such mechanical legalistic smoothness as you have. After the suffering of many years of violence and oppression, the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits, introduced by the revolting invasion of publicity, by TV stupor, and by intolerable music.

There are meaningful warnings which history gives a threatened or perishing society. Such are, for instance, the decadence of art, or a lack of great statesmen. There are open and evident warnings, too. The center of your democracy and of your culture is left without electric power for a few hours only, and all of a sudden crowds of American citizens start looting and creating havoc. The smooth surface film must be very thin, then, the social system quite unstable and unhealthy.

But the fight for our planet, physical and spiritual, a fight of cosmic proportions, is not a vague matter of the future; it has already started. The forces of Evil have begun their offensive; you can feel their pressure, and yet your screens and publications are full of prescribed smiles and raised glasses. What is the joy about?

Very well known representatives of your society, such as George Kennan, say: We cannot apply moral criteria to politics. Thus, we mix good and evil, right and wrong, and make space for the absolute triumph of absolute Evil in the world. On the contrary, only moral criteria can help the West against communism's well planned world strategy. There are no other criteria. Practical or occasional considerations of any kind will inevitably be swept away by strategy. After a certain level of the problem has been reached, legalistic thinking induces paralysis; it prevents one from seeing the size and meaning of events.

In spite of the abundance of information, or maybe because of it, the West has difficulties in understanding reality such as it is. There have been naive predictions by some American experts who believed that Angola would become the Soviet Union's Vietnam or that Cuban expeditions in Africa would best be stopped by special U.S. courtesy to Cuba. Kennan's advice to his own country -- to begin unilateral disarmament -- belongs to the same category. If you only knew how the youngest of the Kremlin officials laugh at your political wizards. As to Fidel Castro, he frankly scorns the United States, sending his troops to distant adventures from his country right next to yours.

However, the most cruel mistake occurred with the failure to understand the Vietnam war. Some people sincerely wanted all wars to stop just as soon as possible; others believed that there should be room for national, or communist, self-determination in Vietnam, or in Cambodia, as we see today with particular clarity. But members of the U.S. anti-war movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there? Do they understand their responsibility today? Or do they prefer not to hear?

The American Intelligentsia lost its nerve and as a consequence thereof danger has come much closer to the United States. But there is no awareness of this. Your shortsighted politicians who signed the hasty Vietnam capitulation seemingly gave America a carefree breathing pause; however, a hundredfold Vietnam now looms over you. That small Vietnam had been a warning and an occasion to mobilize the nation's courage. But if a full-fledged America suffered a real defeat from a small communist half-country, how can the West hope to stand firm in the future?

I have had occasion already to say that in the 20th century Western democracy has not won any major war without help and protection from a powerful continental ally whose philosophy and ideology it did not question. In World War II against Hitler, instead of winning that war with its own forces, which would certainly have been sufficient, Western democracy grew and cultivated another enemy who would prove worse, as Hitler never had so many resources and so many people, nor did he offer any attractive ideas, or have a large number of supporters in the West as the Soviet Union. At present, some Western voices already have spoken of obtaining protection from a third power against aggression in the next world conflict, if there is one. In this case the shield would be China. But I would not wish such an outcome to any country in the world. First of all, it is again a doomed alliance with Evil; also, it would grant the United States a respite, but when at a later date China with its billion people would turn around armed with American weapons, America itself would fall prey to a genocide similar to the in Cambodia in our days.

And yet -- no weapons, no matter how powerful, can help the West until it overcomes its loss of willpower. In a state of psychological weakness, weapons become a burden for the capitulating side. To defend oneself, one must also be ready to die; there is little such readiness in a society raised in the cult of material well-being. Nothing is left, then, but concessions, attempts to gain time, and betrayal. Thus at the shameful Belgrade conference free Western diplomats in their weakness surrendered the line where enslaved members of Helsinki Watchgroups are sacrificing their lives.

Western thinking has become conservative: the world situation should stay as it is at any cost; there should be no changes. This debilitating dream of a status quo is the symptom of a society which has come to the end of its development. But one must be blind in order not to see that oceans no longer belong to the West, while land under its domination keeps shrinking. The two so-called world wars (they were by far not on a world scale, not yet) have meant internal self-destruction of the small, progressive West which has thus prepared its own end. The next war (which does not have to be an atomic one and I do not believe it will) may well bury Western civilization forever.

Facing such a danger, with such splendid historical values in your past, at such a high level of realization of freedom and of devotion to freedom, how is it possible to lose to such an extent the will to defend oneself?

How has this unfavorable relation of forces come about? How did the West decline from its triumphal march to its present sickness? Have there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its development? It does not seem so. The West kept advancing socially in accordance with its proclaimed intentions, with the help of brilliant technological progress. And all of a sudden it found itself in its present state of weakness.

This means that the mistake must be at the root, at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries. I refer to the prevailing Western view of the world which was first born during the Renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the Enlightenment. It became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy: the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him. It could also be called anthropocentricity, with man seen as the center of everything that exists.

The turn introduced by the Renaissance evidently was inevitable historically. The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion, becoming an intolerable despotic repression of man's physical nature in favor of the spiritual one. Then, however, we turned our backs upon the Spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal. This new way of thinking, which had imposed on us its guidance, did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth. It based modern Western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs. Everything beyond physical well-being and accumulation of material goods, all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature, were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems, as if human life did not have any superior sense. That provided access for evil, of which in our days there is a free and constant flow. Merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones.

However, in early democracies, as in the American democracy at the time of its birth, all individual human rights were granted because man is God's creature. That is, freedom was given to the individual conditionally, in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility. Such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years. Two hundred or even fifty years ago, it would have seemed quite impossible, in America, that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims. Subsequently, however, all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the West; a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of Christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice. State systems were -- State systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic. The West ended up by truly enforcing human rights, sometimes even excessively, but man's sense of responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer. In the past decades, the legalistically selfish aspect of Western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse. All the glorified technological achievements of Progress, including the conquest of outer space, do not redeem the 20th century's moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the 19th Century.

As humanism in its development became more and more materialistic, it made itself increasingly accessible to speculation and manipulation by socialism and then by communism. So that Karl Marx was able to say that "communism is naturalized humanism."

This statement turned out not to be entirely senseless. One does see the same stones in the foundations of a despiritualized humanism and of any type of socialism: endless materialism; freedom from religion and religious responsibility, which under communist regimes reach the stage of anti-religious dictatorships; concentration on social structures with a seemingly scientific approach. This is typical of the Enlightenment in the 18th Century and of Marxism. Not by coincidence all of communism's meaningless pledges and oaths are about Man, with a capital M, and his earthly happiness. At first glance it seems an ugly parallel: common traits in the thinking and way of life of today's West and today's East? But such is the logic of materialistic development.

The interrelationship is such, too, that the current of materialism which is most to the left always ends up by being stronger, more attractive, and victorious, because it is more consistent. Humanism without its Christian heritage cannot resist such competition. We watch this process in the past centuries and especially in the past decades, on a world scale as the situation becomes increasingly dramatic. Liberalism was inevitably displaced by radicalism; radicalism had to surrender to socialism; and socialism could never resist communism. The communist regime in the East could stand and grow due to the enthusiastic support from an enormous number of Western intellectuals who felt a kinship and refused to see communism's crimes. And when they no longer could do so, they tried to justify them. In our Eastern countries, communism has suffered a complete ideological defeat; it is zero and less than zero. But Western intellectuals still look at it with interest and with empathy, and this is precisely what makes it so immensely difficult for the West to withstand the East.

I am not examining here the case of a world war disaster and the changes which it would produce in society. As long as we wake up every morning under a peaceful sun, we have to lead an everyday life. There is a disaster, however, which has already been under way for quite some time. I am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness.

To such consciousness, man is the touchstone in judging everything on earth -- imperfect man, who is never free of pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other defects. We are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life. In the East, it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party. In the West, commercial interests suffocate it. This is the real crisis. The split in the world is less terrible -- The split in the world is less terrible than the similarity of the disease plaguing its main sections.

If humanism were right in declaring that man is born only to be happy, he would not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to die, his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature. It cannot be unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life. It cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most of them. It has to be the fulfillment of a permanent, earnest duty so that one's life journey may become an experience of moral growth, so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it. It is imperative to review the table of widespread human values. Its present incorrectness is astounding. It is not possible that assessment of the President's performance be reduced to the question how much money one makes or of unlimited availability of gasoline. Only voluntary, inspired self-restraint can raise man above the world stream of materialism.

It would be retrogression to attach oneself today to the ossified formulas of the Enlightenment. Social dogmatism leaves us completely helpless in front of the trials of our times. Even if we are spared destruction by war, our lives will have to change if we want to save life from self-destruction. We cannot avoid revising the fundamental definitions of human life and human society. Is it true that man is above everything? Is there no Superior Spirit above him? Is it right that man's life and society's activities have to be determined by material expansion in the first place? Is it permissible to promote such expansion to the detriment of our spiritual integrity?

If the world has not come to its end, it has approached a major turn in history, equal in importance to the turn from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. It will exact from us a spiritual upsurge: We shall have to rise to a new height of vision, to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the Middle Ages, but, even more importantly, our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the Modern era.

This ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage. No one on earth has any other way left but -- upward.

Dinner, let us imagine, has reached its second wine. We are exchanging pleasantries: gossip, tittle-tattle, perilously keen remarks. Like a fine sauce, they pique the mind. They pass the time. A thought is peeled and placed upon a plate. A nearby lady lends us a small smile, and there are glances brilliant as the silver. Patiently we listen while another talks, because everyone, our etiquette instructs, must have his chance to speak. We wait. We draw upon the cloth with unused knives. Our goblets turn as slowly as the world.

And on this beautiful ceremonial morning I want to talk to you about talking, that commonest of all our intended activities, for talking is our public link with one another; it is a need; it is an art; it is the chief instrument of all instruction; it is the most personal aspect of our private life. To those who have sponsored our appearance in the world, the first memorable moment to follow our inaugural bawl is the birth of our first word. It is that noise, a sound that is no longer a simple signal, like the greedy squalling of a gull, but a declaration of the incipient presence of mind, that delivers us into the human realm. Before, there was only an organ of energy, intake, and excretion, but now a person has begun. And in no idle, ordinary, or jesting sense, words are what that being will become. It is language which most shows a man, Ben Jonson said: “Speake that I may see thee.” And Emerson certainly supports him: “Man is only half himself,” he said, “the other half is his expression.” Truths like this have been the long companions of our life, and so we often overlook them, as we miss the familiar mole upon our chin, even while powdering the blemish, or running over it with a razor.

Silence is the soul’s invisibility. We can, of course, conceal ourselves behind lies and sophistries, but when we speak, we are present, however careful our disguise. The monster we choose to be on Halloween says something about the monster we are. I have often gone to masquerades as myself, and in that guise no one knew I was there.

Plato thought of the soul as an ardent debating society in which our various interests pled their causes; and there were honest speeches and dishonest ones; there was reason, lucid and open and lovely like the nakedness of the gods,where truth found its youngest friend and nobility its ancient eloquence; and there was also pin-eyed fanaticism, deceit and meanness, a coarseness like sand in cold grease; there was bribery and seduction, flattery, brow-beating and bombast. Little has changed, in that regard, either in our souls or in society since; for the great Greeks were correct: life must be lived according to the right word–the logos they loved–and so the search for it, the mastery of it, the fullest and finest and truest expression of it, the defense of it, became the heart of the educational enterprise.

To an almost measureless degree, to know is to possess words, and all of us know how much words concern us here, at the university, in this context of texts. Adam created the animals and birds by naming them, and we name incessantly, conserving achievements and customs, and countries that no longer exist, in the museum of human memory. But it is not only the books which we pile about us like a building, or the papers we painfully compose, the exams we write, the calculations we come to by means of mystic diagrams, mathematical symbols, astrological charts or other ill- or well-drawn maps of the mind; it is not alone the languages we learn to mispronounce, the lists, the arguments and rhymes, we get by heart; it is not even our tendency to turn what is unwritten into writing with a mere look, so that rocks will suddenly say their age and origin and activity, or what is numb flesh and exposed bone will cry out that cotton candy killed it, or cancer, or canoodling, the letter C like a cut across an artery, the flow of meaning like blood; no, it is not the undeniable importance of these things which leads me to lay such weight upon the word; it is rather our interior self I’m concerned with, and therefore with the language which springs out of the most retiring and inmost parts of us, and is the image of its parent like a child: the words we use to convey our love to another, or to cope with anxiety, for instance; the words which will convince, persuade, which will show us clearly, or make the many one; the words I listen to when I wait out a speech at a dinner party; words which can comfort and assuage, damage and delight, amuse and dismay; but above all, the words which one burns like beacons against the darkness, and which together comprise the society of the silently speaking self; because all these words are but humble echoes of the words the poet uses when she speaks of passion, or the historian when he drives his nails through time, or when the psychoanalyst divines our desires as through tea leaves left at the bottom of our dreams.

Even if the world becomes so visual that words must grow faces to save themselves, and put on smiles made of fragrant paste, and even if we all hunker down in front of films like savages before a divinity, have experience explained to us in terms of experiences which need to be explained, still, we shall not trade portraits of our love affairs, only of ourselves; there is no Polaroid that will develop in moments the state of our soul, or cassette to record our pangs of conscience; so we shall never talk in doodles over dinner, or call up our spirit to its struggle with a little private sit-com or a dreary soap. Even if the world falls silent and we shrink in fear within ourselves; even if words are banished to the Balkans or otherwise driven altogether out of hearing, as though every syllable were subversive (as indeed each is); all the same, when we have withdrawn from any companionship with things and people, when we have collapsed in terror behind our talcumed skins, and we peer suspiciously through the keyholes of our eyes, when we have reached the limit of our dwindle – the last dry seed of the self – then we shall see how greatly correct is the work of Samuel Beckett, because we shall find there, inside that seed, nothing but his featureless cell, nothing but voice, nothing but darkness and talk.
 

How desperately, then, we need to learn it – to talk to ourselves – because we are babies about it. Oh, we have excellent languages for the secrets of nature. Wave packets, black holes, and skeins of genes: we can write precisely and consequentially of these, as well as other extraordinary phenomena; but can we talk even of trifles: for instance, of the way a look sometimes crosses a face like the leap of a frog, so little does it live there, or how the habit of anger raisins the heart, or wet leaves paper a street? Our anatomy texts can skin us without our pain, the cellular urges of trees are no surprise, the skies are driven by winds we cannot see; yet science has passed daily life by like the last bus, and left it to poetry.

It is terribly important to know how a breast is made: how to touch it to make a tingle, or discover a hidden cyst (we find these things written of in books); but isn’t it just as important to be able to put the beauty of a body in words, words we give like a gift to its bearer; to communicate the self to another, and in that way form a community of feeling, of thought about feeling, of belief about thought: an exchange of warmth like breathing, of simple tastes and the touch of the eye, and other sensations shortly to be sought, since there is no place for the utopia of the flesh outside the utopia of talk.

It can’t be helped. We are made of layers of language like a Viennese torte. We are a Freudian dessert. My dinner companion, the lady who lent me her smile, has raised her goblet in a quiet toast. It is as though its rim had touched me, and I try to find words for the feeling, and for the wine which glows like molten rubies in her glass; because if I can do that, I can take away more than a memory which will fade faster than a winter footprint; I can take away an intense and interpreted description, a record as tough to erase as a relief, since without words what can be well and richly remembered? Yesterdays are gone like drying mist. Without our histories, without the conservation which concepts nearly alone make possible, we could not preserve our lives as were the bodies of the pharaohs, the present would soon be as clear of the past as a bright day, and we would be innocent arboreals again.

Of course we could redream the occasion, or pretend to film our feeling, but we’ll need words to label and index our images anyway, and can the photograph contain the rush of color to my face, the warmth which reminds me I also am a glass and have become wine?
 

I remember because I talk. I talk from morning to night, and then I talk on in my sleep. Our talk is so precious to us, we think we punish others when we stop. So I stay at peace because I talk. Tete-a-tetes are talk. Shop is talk. Parties are parades of anecdotes, gossip, opinion, raillery, and reportage. There is sometimes a band and we have to shout. Out of an incredibly complex gabble, how wonderfully clever of me to hear so immediately my own name; yet at my quiet breakfast table, I may be unwilling, and thus unable, to hear a thing my wife says. When wives complain that romance has fled from their marriage, they mean their husbands have grown quiet and unresponsive as moss. Taciturnity – long, lovely word – it is a famous tactic. As soon as two people decide they have nothing more to talk about, everything should be talked out. Silence shields no passion. Only the mechanical flame is sputterless and silent.

Like a good husband, then, I tell my wife what went on through the day – in the car, on the courts, at the office. Well, perhaps I do not tell her allthat went on, perhaps I give her a slightly sanitized account. I tell my friends how I fared in New York, and of the impatient taxi which honked me through the streets. I tell my students the substance of what they should have read. I tell my children how it used to be (it was better), and how I was a hero (of a modest sort, of course) in the Great War, moving from fact to fiction within the space of a single word. I tell my neighbors pleasant lies about the beauty of their lawns and dogs and vandalizing tykes, and in my head I tell the whole world where to get off.

Those who have reputations as great conversationalists are careful never to let anyone else open a mouth. Like Napoleons, they first conquer, then rule, the entire space of speech around them. Jesus preached. Samuel Johnson bullied. Carlyle fulminated. Bucky Fuller drones. Wittgenstein thought painfully aloud. But Socrates talked … hazardously, gayly, amorously, eloquently, religiously … he talked with wit, with passion, with honesty; he asked; he answered; he considered; he debated; he entertained; he made of his mind a boulevard before there was even a France.

I remember – I contain a past – partly because my friends and family allow me to repeat and polish my tales, tall as they sometimes are, like the stalk Jack climbed to encounter the giant. Shouldn’t I be able to learn from history how to chronicle my self? “Every man should be so much an artist,” again Emerson said, “that he could report in conversation what had befallen him.” Words befell Emerson often. He made speeches on occasions like this one, and until his mind changed, he always meant what he said. Frequently his mind changed before he reached any conclusion. In his head his heart turned to look about and saw the other side.
 

Talk, of course, is not always communication. It is often just a buzz, the hum the husband makes when he’s still lit, but the station’s gone off. We can be bores as catastrophic as quakes, causing even the earth to yawn. Talk can be cruel and injurious to a degree which is frightening; the right word wrongly used can strike a man down like a club, turn a heart dark forever, freeze the feelings; nevertheless, while the thief is threatening to take our money or our life, he has yet to do either; and while Sadat and Carter and Begin talk, while talk mediates a strike, or weighs an allegation in the press or in committee, or considers a law in congress or argues a crime in court; while a spouse gripes, or the con man cons, while ideas are explained to a point beyond opacity by the prof; then it’s not yet the dreadful day of the exam, no one has lost their nest egg or filed for divorce, sentence has not been passed, the crime has not yet occurred, the walkout, or the war. It may sound like a balk, a hitch in the motion, a failure to follow through, but many things recommend talk, not least its rich and wandering rhymes.

Our thoughts tend to travel like our shadow in the morning walking west, casting their outline just ahead of us so that we can see and approve, or amend and cancel, what we are about to say. It is the only rehearsal our conversation usually gets; but that is one reason we fall upon cliche as if it were a sofa and not a sword; for we have rehearsed “good morning,” and “how are you?” and “have a nice day,” to the place where the tongue is like a stale bun in the mouth; and we have talked of Tommy’s teeth and our cold car’s stalling treachery, of our slobby dog’s affection and Alice’s asthma and Hazel’s latest honeybunny, who, thank god, is only black and not gay like her last one; we have emptied our empty jars over one another like slapstick comics through so many baggy-panted performances we can now dream of Cannes and complain of Canada with the same breath we use to spit an olive in a napkin, since one can easily do several thoughtless things at once – in fact, one ought; and indeed it is true that prefab conversation frees the mind, yet rarely does the mind have a mind left after these interconnected cliches have conquered it; better to rent rooms to hooligans who will only draw on the walls and break the furniture; for our Gerberized phrases touch nothing; they keep the head hollow by crowding out thought; they fill all the chairs with buttocks like balloons; they are neither fed nor feed; they drift like dust; they refuse to breathe.
 

We forget sometimes that we do live with ourselves – worse luck most likely – as well as within. The head we inhabit is a haunted house. Nevertheless, we often ignore our own voice when it speaks to us: “Remember me,” the spirit says, “I am your holy ghost.” But we are bored by our own baloney. Why otherwise would we fall in love if not to hear that same sweet hokum from another? Still, we should remember that we comprise true Siamese twins, fastened by language and feeling, wed better than any bed; because when we talk to ourselves we divide into the self which is all ear and the self which is all mouth. Yet which one of us is which? Does the same self do most of the talking while a second self soaks it up, or is there a real conversation?

Frequently we put on plays like a producer: one voice belongs to sister, shrill and intrepidly stupid; a nephew has another (he wants a cookie); the boss is next – we’ve cast him as a barnyard bully; and then there is a servant or a spouse, crabby and recalcitrant. All speak as they are spoken through; each runs around in its role like a caged squirrel, while an audience we also invent (patient, visible, too easily pleased) applauds the heroine or the hero because of the way they’ve righted wrongs like an avenging angel, answered every challenge like a Lancelot, every question like Ann Landers, and met every opportunity like a perfect Romeo, every romance like a living doll. If we really love the little comedy we’ve constructed, it’s likely to have a long run.

Does it really matter how richly and honestly and well we speak? What is our attitude toward ourselves; what tone do we tend to take? Consider Hamlet, a character who escapes his circumstances and achieves greatness despite the fact his will wavers or he can’t remember his father’s ghost. He certainly doesn’t bring it off because he has an Oedipus complex (we are all supposed to have that); but because he talks to himself more beautifully than anyone else ever has. Consider his passion, his eloquence, his style, his range: “O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!” he exclaims; “now could I drink hot blood,” he brags; “to be or not to be,” he wonders; “O,” he hopes, “that this too too solid flesh would melt,” and he complains that all occasions do inform against him. For our part, what do we do? do we lick our own hand and play the spaniel? do we whine and wheedle or natter like a ninny? Can we formulate our anger in a righteous phrase, or will we be reduced to swearing like a soldier? All of us are dramatists, but how will we receive our training? Where can we improve upon the puerile theatricals of our parents, if not here among the plays and perils of Pirandello and the dialogues of Plato (among the many glories of the letter “P” – “peachtree” and “pulchritude,” “philosophy” and “friendship”), the operas of Puccini and the follies of the faculty?
 

If we think awareness is like water purling gaily in its stream, we have been listening to the wrong James, for our consciousness is largely composed of slogans and signs, of language of one kind or other: we wake to an alarm; we read the weather by the brightness of a streak on the ceiling, the mood of our lover by the night’s cramp still clenched in her morning body; our trembling tells us we’re hung over; we wipe ourselves with a symbol of softness, push an ad around over our face; the scale rolls up a number which means “overweight,” and the innersoles of our shoes say “hush!” Thus, even if we haven’t uttered a word, we’ve so far spent the morning reading. Signs don’t stream. They may straggle, but they mostly march. Language allies itself with order. Even its fragments suggest syntax, wholeness, regularity, though many of us are ashamed to address ourselves in complete sentences. Rhetorically structured paragraphs seem pretentious to us, as if, to gaze at our image in a mirror, we had first to put on a tux; and this means that everything of real importance, every decision which requires care, thoughtful analysis, emotional distance, and mature judgment, must be talked out with someone else – a consequence we can’t always face, with its attendant arguments, embarrassments, counterclaims, and lies. To think for yourself – not narrowly, but rather as a mind – you must be able to talk to yourself: well, openly, and at length. You must come in from the rain of requests and responses. You must take and employ your time as if it were your life. And that side of you which speaks must be prepared to say anything so long as it is so – is seen so, felt so, thought so – and that side of you which listens must be ready to hear horrors, for much of what is so is horrible – horrible to see, horrible to feel, horrible to consider. But at length, and honestly – that is not enough. To speak well to oneself … to speak well we must go down as far as the bucket can be lowered. Every thought must be thought through from its ultimate cost back to its cheap beginnings; every perception, however profound and distant, must be as clear and easy as the moon; every desire must be recognized as a relative and named as fearlessly as Satan named his angels; finally, every feeling must be felt to its bottom where the bucket rests in the silt and water rises like a tower around it. To talk to ourselves well requires, then, endless rehearsals – rehearsals in which we revise, and the revision of the inner life strikes many people as hypocritical; but to think how to express some passion properly is the only way to be possessed by it, for unformed feelings lack impact, just as unfelt ideas lose weight. So walk around unrewritten, if you like. Live on broken phrases and syllable gristle, telegraphese and film reviews. No one will suspect … until you speak.

There are kinds and forms of this inner speech. Many years ago, when my eldest son was about fourteen, I was gardening alongside the house one midday in mid-May, hidden as it happened between two bushes I was pruning, when Richard came out of the house in a hurry to return to school following lunch, and like a character in a French farce, skulking there, I overheard him talking to himself. “Well, racing fans, it looks … it looks like the question we’ve all been asking is about to be answered, because HERE COMES RICHARD GASS OUT OF THE PITS NOW! He doesn’t appear to be limping from that bad crash he had at the raceway yesterday – what a crash that was! – and he is certainly going straight for his car … what courage! … yes, he is getting into his car … not a hesitation … yes, he is going to be off in a moment for the track … yes –” and then he went, peddling out of my hearing, busily broadcasting his life. 
 
My son’s consciousness, in that moment, was not only thoroughly verbal (although its subject was the Indy 500, then not too many days away, and although he could still see the street he would ride on), it had a form: that given to his language and its referents by the radio sportscaster. Richard’s body was, in effect, on the air; his mind was in the booth “upstairs,” while his feelings were doubtless mixed in with his audience, both at home and in the stands. He was being seen, and heard, and spoken of, at the same time.
 
Later this led me to wonder whether we all didn’t have fashions and forms in which we talked to ourselves; whether some of these might be habits of the most indelible sort, the spelling out of our secret personality; and, finally, whether they might not vitally influence the way we spoke to others, especially in our less formal moments – in bed, at breakfast, at the thirteenth tee. I recognized at once that this was certainly true of me; that although I employed many modes, there was one verbal form which had me completely in its grip the way Baron Munchhausen was held in his own tall tales, or the Piers Plowman poet in his lovely alliteration. If Richard’s was that of the radio broadcast, mine was that of the lecture. I realized that when I woke in the morning, I rose from bed only to ask the world if it had any questions. I was, almost from birth, and so I suppose by “bottom nature,” what Gertrude Stein called Ezra Pound – a village explainer – which, she said, was all right if you were a village, but if not, not; and sooner than sunrise I would be launched on an unvoiced speechification on the art of internal discourse, a lecture I have given many times, though rarely aloud.

I have since asked a number of people, some from very different backgrounds, what shape their internal talk took, and found, first of all, that they agreed to the important presence of these forms, and that one type did tend to dominate the others: it was often broadcasting – never the lecture – though I once encountered a sermon and several prayers; it frequently took place in the courtroom where one was conducting a fearless prosecution or a triumphant defense; it was regularly the repetition of some pattern of parental exchange, a rut full of relatives and preconditioned response; the drama appeared to be popular, as well as works of pornography, though, in this regard, there were more movies shown than words said – a pity, both modes need such improvement; monologues such as Browning might have penned: the vaunt, the threat, the keen, the kvetch, the eulogy for yourself when dead; there was even the bedtime story, the diary, the chronicle, and, of course, the novel, gothic in character, or at least full of intrigue and suspense: Little did William Gass realize when he rose that gentle May morning to thump his chest and touch his toes that he would soon be embarked on an adventure whose endless ramifications would utterly alter his life; otherwise he might not have set out for the supermarket without a list; otherwise he might not have done that extra push-up; he might better have stayed in bed with the bedclothes pulled thickly over his stupidly chattering head.

Yet I should like to suggest (despite the undeniable sappiness of it) that the center of the self, itself, is this secret, obsessive, often silly, nearly continuous voice – the voice that is the surest sign we are alive; and that one fundamental function of language is the communication with this self which it makes feasible; and that, if the university has done its work, you are a bit nearer than you were before to being one of the few fortunates who have made rich and beautiful the great conversation which constitutes our life.

Everywhere here in this Quad, everywhere along the long lines of listening chairs – like a choir before bursting into song – there is the silent murmur of us all, our glad, our scrappy, rude, grand, small talk to ourselves, the unheard hum of our humanity; without which – think of it! – we might not be awake; without which – imagine it! – we might not be alive; since while we speak we live up there above our bodies in the mind, and there is hope as long as we continue to talk; so long as we continue to speak, to search for eloquence even over happiness or sympathy in sorrow, even if all that is left to us is the omitted outcry, Christ’s query, the silent shout: “My God, my God, why have you left me alone?”

I'm here today for a very special reason.

When my daughter, Eve, was small, every dinner conversation would go roughly the same way. I would introduce a fascinating topic. Then I would make some glittering comments and generally attack it from all sides until Eve or one of her sisters would indicate a sufficiently low level of interest to make me grind to a stuttering halt.

Now Eve is graduating college and I've been asked by her class if I would give a little talk. Of course I accepted.This will be the first time in 21 years that she'll listen to one of my speeches all the way through.

As I stand here, I'm probably experiencing what most parents feel today. A desire, a little inner tug, to say something that will count in a special way.

Deep in our hearts we know that the best things said come last. People will talk for hours saying nothing much and then linger at the door with words that come with a rush from the heart. Doorways, it seems, are where the truth is told. We are all gathered at a doorway today. It's the end of something and the beginning of something else. And my guess is there will be a lot of lingering at the door today with the hope that one of us will say something that will somehow express what can't be said in words.

We linger there with our hand on the knob chattering away like Polonius to Laertes. Now remember "neither a borrower nor a lender be"... and don't forget "This above all: To thine own self be true and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man." But the very best things said often slip out completely unheralded and preceded by the words, "Oh, by the way."

I hear that patients will talk to their therapists for an hour, hardly saying anything, and just as they're leaving, turn at the door and say, "Oh, by the way," and in one sentence reveal everything they've been avoiding for 50 minutes.

In real life, when Polonius had finished giving all that fatherly advice to his son, who probably wasn't paying all that much attention anyway, he must have said - just as the boy was stepping into his boat - "Oh, by the way, if you get into any trouble, don't forget you can always call me at the office." As we stand in the doorway today, these are my parting words to my daughter, Eve. I may sound a little like Polonius, Eve, but Polonius and I have something in common - like all fathers, we love to hear ourselves talk. And there are so many things I want to tell you.

The first thing I want to say is don't be scared. With all the giddy excitement you feel - and that I feel with you as you graduate - my guess is you're also feeling a little uncertain today. You're suddenly a grown woman with your whole life in your hands. And you're being flung into a world that's running about as smoothly as a car with square wheels. I want you to know that it's OK to be uncertain. I'm uncertain, too. In a world like this, it's appropriate to be uncertain. You're an adult in a time when the leaders of the world are behaving like children whose demands are not negotiable. Where the central image of our day is a terrorist one: humane concerns inhumanely expressed. And where the only response to this is impotent fury If you weren't a little uncertain, I'd be nervous for you. You've been preparing yourself all these years, but you're not sure for what. You know what you want to do when you leave school, but you're not entirely sure what it will be like - how it will work out. Some of your classmates don't have any idea what they'll do for the rest of their lives. And that's all right, too, because all of you have learned the most important thing that any school could teach you - you've learned to learn.

If you feel a little off balance, it's understandable. Adulthood has come upon you suddenly and you're not all that sure you're ready for it. I think that sometimes I'm not ready for adulthood either - yours or mine.

The day before yesterday you were a baby I was afraid to hold because you seemed so fragile. Yesterday, all I could feel was helplessness when you broke your small, 9-year-old arm. Only this morning you were a teenager. As I get older, the only thing that speeds up is time. But as much as it's true that time is a thief, time also leaves something in exchange. With time comes experience - and however uncertain you may be about the rest of the world, at least about your own work you will be sure.

And that's something else I want to tell you as we stand in this doorway today. Love your work. If you always put your heart into everything you do, you really can't lose.

If your heart is in it, you'll probably succeed, and if it isn't in it, you probably won't succeed. But the reason you can't lose is that whether you wind up making a lot of money or not, you will have had a wonderful time, and no one will ever be able to take that away from you.

I want to tell you everything. I want to squeeze things great and small into this lingering good-bye.

I want to tell you to keep laughing.

I used to be afraid that writing and acting in comedies might be a frivolous occupation, but when I think about all the good that laughing does for people, I get the feeling that making people laugh can be noble work. You have a wonderful laugh. You gurgle when you laugh. Keep gurgling. Be sure to gurgle three times a day for your own well being. There are people who think that the only thing that separates humans from the rest of the animals is their ability to laugh. I'm not so sure anything separates us from the rest of the animals except perhaps our extreme egotism that leads us to think that they're animals and we're not. But I do notice that when people are laughing, they're generally not killing one another. So keep laughing yourself and if you can get other people to join you in your laughter, you may help keep this shaky boat afloat.

I want to tell you things that will see you through. I have this helpless urge to pass on maxims to you. But we live in new times. Strange times. Even the Golden Rule doesn't seem adequate to pass on to a daughter. There should be something added to it. You know how I love amendments. You knew I wanted to amend the Constitution, but you probably didn't know I wanted to amend the Golden Rule as well. Here's my Golden Rule for a tarnished age: Be fair with others but then keep after them until they're fair with you.

It's a complex world. I hope you'll learn to make distinctions. You know how much I love logic. I always felt that the most important parts of my education were learning to reason and learning to use language well. That's why when you were a very little girl, I started trying to give you lessons in logic. I smile when I think that to this day, you can still remember what I passed on to you as the first rule of logic: A thing cannot both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect. (In your head, you're saying that along with me right now, aren't you?) You were kind enough to take a logic course because I had spoken too highly of it, only to find out that they teach symbolic logic now and they never even mention the first rule of logic. But whatever mode you reason in, I hope you'll always make distinctions. A peach is not its fuzz, a toad is not its warts, a person is not his or her crankiness. If we can make distinctions, we can be tolerant, and we can get to the heart of our problems instead of wrestling endlessly with their gross exteriors. And once you make a habit of making distinctions, you'll begin challenging your own assumptions. Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while or the light won't come in. If you challenge your own, you won't be so quick to accept the unchallenged assumptions of others. You'll be a lot less likely to be caught up in bias or prejudice or be influenced by people who ask you to hand over your brains, your soul or your money because they have everything all figured out for you.

I don't have the rhythms or style of Polonius today but I have all his doddering urgency.

I want to tell you to be as smart as you can but to try to remember that it's always better to be wise than to be smart. And don't be upset that it takes a long, long time to find wisdom because nobody knows where wisdom can be found. It tends to break out at unexpected times like a rare virus and mostly people with compassion and understanding are susceptible to it.

The door is inching a little closer toward the latch and I still haven't said it. You'll be gone and I won't have found the words. Let me dig a little deeper.

Let me go back to when I was in college. There were words that had power for me then - maybe they will for you now.

I had forgotten how much this idea meant to me - how much I wrote about it and thought about it.

It was the essence of a philosophy that was very popular at the time and it's one of the most helpful and cheerful ideas I've ever heard.

It's this: Life is absurd and meaningless and full of nothingness. Possibly this doesn't strike you as helpful and cheerful, but I think it is, because it's honest and because it goads you on.

I had a teacher in those days who saw me with a book by Jean Paul Sartre under my arm and he said to me, "Be careful, if you read too much of that you'll start walking around dressed in black, looking wan, doing nothing for the rest of your life." Well, I read the book anyway and as it turned out, I'm tanned and lovely, I'm rich and productive and I'm happy like nobody's business.

Maybe it was my natural optimism at work, but what I saw and warmed to in the existentialist writings was that life is meaningless unless you bring meaning to it; that it is up to us to create our own existence. Unless you do something, unless you make something it's as though you aren't there.

I was very taken at the time by a Catholic existentialist called Gabriel Marcel who spoke about fidelity as essential to existence. Fidelity had a special meaning for him - it meant presence - being there with the people around you. None of this seemed dour to me. Existentialism was supposed to be the philosophy of despair. But not to me - because it faced the cold hard stone you hit when you touch rock bottom and I saw in it a way to bound back up again. No matter how loving or loved we are, it eventually occurs to most of us - that deep, deep down inside there, we're all alone. I'm not telling you this to depress you or to turn your eyes away from the soft flutter of blossoms on a day in spring. But I know that winter's coming and when the moment comes for you to wrestle with that cold loneliness which is every person's private monster, I want you to face the damn thing. I want you to see it for what it is and win.

This spring is the fulfillment of an era in a way. It was news back then when people declared God to be dead, but now Sartre is dead - and in a curious way so is the optimism that spawned his pessimism. The distressing reality is that 25 years ago when I was in college we all talked about nothingness but moved into a world of effort and endeavor. And now no one much talks about nothingness but the world itself, the one you will move into, is filled with it. 

You may not feel it right now, not on a day like this. Maybe it's something that strikes you - not when you graduate college - but only when your child does. But whenever that sense of absurdity hits you, I want you to be ready. It will have a hard time getting hold of you if you're already in motion. You can learn the skills of your profession. You can use those skills and others you have learned here and you can dig into the world and push it into better shape.

For one thing, you can clean the air and water. Some people feel that lead poisoning was a major cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, because the ruling class had their food cooked in expensive pots that were lined with lead. They didn't know any better, but we don't have that excuse. Now almost 2,000 years later a numher of American com-panies have hit upon the incredibly clever idea of getting rid of their industrial waste by putting it into our food. Not directly of course; that would be too expensive. First they put it in the ground - then it goes into the water, and the next thing you know you're eating a sludgeburger. You can do something about that.

Or you can try to make the justice system work, You can bring the day a little closer when the rich and privileged have to live by the same standards as the poor and the outcast.

Or you can try to put an end to organized crime - that happy family whose main objective is to convince us they don't exist while they destroy a whole generation with drugs and suck the life from our economy.

Or you can step gingerly in the path of the lumbering behemoth of nuclear power. And you can ask the simple question: What ever happened to the principle of no radiation without representation?

Or you can keep the tiger of war away from our gates for awhile longer. You can do what you can to keep old men from sending children away to die. They're tuning up for the song of war now.

They're making preparations and trial excursions. They're tickling our anger. They're asking us if we're ready to pour the cream of our youth out onto the ground where it will seep into the earth and disappear forever. Tell them we're not. The time to stop the next war is now - before it starts.

If you want to take absurdity by the neck and shake it till its brains rattle, you can try to find out how it is that people can see one another as less than human. How people can be capable of both nurture and torture. How we can worry and fret about a little girl caught in a mine shaft, spending days and nights getting her out but then burn a village to the ground and destroy all its people with hardly the blink of an eye. When the new draft was proposed a few months ago, some kids raised signs that said "Nothing is worth dying for." I don't agree. I don't feel that nothing is worth dying for, but since I was very young I questioned if anything is worth killing for. If you're interested, you can question that, too, and you can try to find out why people all over the world, of every country, of every class, of every religion have, at one time or another, found it so easy, for reasons large and small, to use other people, to make them suffer and to just plain do away with them.

And while you're doing all of that, there's something else you can do. You can pass on the torch that's been carried from Seneca Falls. Remember that every right you have as a woman was won for you by women fighting hard. Everything else you have is a privilege, not a right. A privilege is given and taken away at the pleasure of those in power. There are little girls being born right now who won't even have the same rights you do when they grow up unless you do something to maintain them and extend the range of equality for women. The soup of civilized life is a nourishing stew but it doesn't keep bubbling on its own. Put something back in the pot as you leave for the people in line behind you.

There are, of course, hundreds of things you can work on, and they're all fairly impossible to achieve, so there's plenty to keep you busy for the rest of your life. I can't promise you this will ever completely reduce that sense of absurdity, but it may get it down to a manageable level. It will allow you once in awhile to take a glorious vacation from nothingness and bask in the feeling that, all in all, things do seem to be moving forward. I can see your brow knitting in that way that I love. That crinkle between your eyebrows that signals your doubt and your skepticism just as it does on the forehead of your mother and your Grandpa Simon. The genetic code is signaling your doubt to me right now. Why - on a day of such excitement and hope should I be talking of nothingness and decay? Because I want you to focus that hope and level that excitement into coherent rays that will strike like a laser at the targets of our discontent.

I want you to be potent; to do good when you can and to hold your wit and your intelligence like a shield against other people's wantonness. And above all, to laugh and enjoy yourself in a life of your own choosing and in a world of your own making. I want you to be strong and aggressive and tough and resilient and full of feeling. I want you to be everything that's you, deep at the center of your being.

I want you to have chutzpah.

Nothing important was ever accomplished without chutzpah. Columbus had chutzpah. The signers of the Declaration of Independence had chutzpah. Don't ever aim your doubt at yourself. Laugh at yourself, but don't doubt yourself. Whenever you wonder about yourself, look up at the stars swirling around in the heavens and just realize how tiny and puny they are. They're supposed to be gigantic explosions and they're just these insignificant little dots. If you step back from things far enough you realize how important and powerful you are. Be bold. Let the strength of your desire give force and moment to your every step. Move with all of yourself. When you embark for strange places don't leave any of yourself safely on shore. They may laugh at you if you don't discover India. Let them laugh. India's already there. You'll come back with a brand new America. Have the nerve to go into unexplored territory. Be brave enough to live life creatively.

The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. It is not the previously known. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. You can't get there by bus, only by hard work and risk and by not quite knowing what you're doing, but what you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover will be yourself.

Well, those are my parting words as today's door closes softly between us. There will be other partings and other last words in our lives so if today's lingering at the threshold didn't quite speak the unspeakable, maybe the next one will.

I'll let you go now

So long, be happy.

Oh, by the way, I love you. 

First, let me say I find it hard to believe that I am here at all; I do not want to acknowledge that it has been 33 years, since I sat where you sit, suffering a relentless sermon from one of my elders, waiting for my certified admission to the world of power, prestige, productivity — challenge, commitment, opportunity — service, stimulation, satisfaction — all the staples in the glossary of graduation speakers. It was a time — 1948 — of national exuberance and benevolence — remember (from your ancient history books) zoot suits and hot rods and the Marshall Plan; but it was also a time of transition — from uneasy friendship to cold war with Russia; from a country that had only a few years before been alive with social and economic inventiveness to one that was becoming increasingly conservative and unpredictable. We were a nation on the brink of McCarthyism. We would be blind for a decade more to the gnawing civil rights problems in our midst. We were all women then, only slowly awakening to our own most profound needs and wants. Most of my class (by the standards of the times) would soon be rated successful: married and family-bound; a few would go on to graduate school and serious professional careers.

In the three decades since then, the core of our adult lives, we have witnessed momentous events; two “limited” wars that tore at our national vitals, an international upheaval in which losers became winners, and winners supplicants, the statement by blacks, Hispanics, women, poor and handicapped persons of what they wanted their lives to be, the rise and decline of antiwar and hippie cultures, flower children, campus and urban riots, the emergence or the New Morality and one-issue politics. We have wrestled with “permanent under cultures,” the links between poverty and crime, urban decay, tides of illegal immigrants and refugees, international terrorism, the curse of narcotics and alcohol, national ennui — and we have not mastered any of them. We have watched the funeral processions of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and monitored the hourly hospital bulletins on President Reagan and the Pope. We have staggered from Keynesian dogma to supply-side economics, from recession to inflation, from oil to natural gas to nuclear power to solar energy, from Doctor Spock’s benevolent permissiveness to Spartan regimes of parental authority, from medicare, social security, guaranteed income, and public housing to accelerated depreciation, tax cuts, cost benefit analyses and deregulation.

The next three decades of your life, I venture, will be just as variable, unstable and unpredictable. The pace of events does not slow; it quickens. The dogmas and givens of today may be rejected when you are thirty-five; the problems you will face then do not exist or are only faintly perceived today. Your economics and sociology, technology, perhaps even your biology may be obsolete.

I would be kidding if I told you I entirely envy you those years ahead. I don’t. They look like “hard times” to me: the myths of our country’s inherent superiority in everything we undertake — from cars to wars — have been exploded; the American dream-trip, rags to riches, looks less splendid, not so much because it can’t be taken, but because the riches themselves are tarnished by inflation, restlessness, rootless ness and shoddy quality control; the causes of the fifties, sixties, and seventies are threadbare, the leaders that stirred the passions of the young have for the most part, been worn down or gunned down. Yours is truly a task of “starting over” — rethinking national and personal goals, reformulating the rules for sharing limited resources; reassessing our delusions that we can do everything and be everywhere on the globe. John Kennedy used to quote the Chinese curse — May you live in interesting times. You will — have no fear. Interesting and frustrating and thrilling and terrifying times. There are those who would face the new problems by’ a return to old ways, ignore the halting — more often than not unsuccessful — efforts of the past thirty years by redefining the problems themselves out of existence; retrenching into a turn-of-the-century world (that never really was) of white clapboard houses, village greens, chicken every Sunday, docile, obedient teenagers in jackets and ties and lace petticoats. Of course there are good things, worth preserving from that earlier time, but there are good things, too, worth preserving out of the decades just past. In the rush to imprint a judgment of failure on all of those years and all of those efforts to do something, I hope that your generation of leaders will be the true conservatives, selectively saving the real gains, acknowledging the signs that progress has been made, doing at least some of the same things, but doing them better.

What my generation saved you were beginnings. The unfinished work is monumental. The complex and explosive debate over how we control, without disabling, our economy, is yet unresolved in the Congress. The poor are still with us, still exploited and neglected; so are battered children, forgotten old people, the homeless, jobless, sick, undernourished, unloved; our prisons get bigger, more crowded, and more inhumane.

Compassion can not be allowed to go out of style.

I must admit that many of us who were a part of efforts to improve the lot of the poor, aged, women, children, the mentally ill and retarded, to make our criminal justice or economic system or our politics a little fairer, now look back and wonder if it was worth it; wonder whether the timid first steps we took, toward racial, sexual and personal equality, juvenile justice, and prison reform, whether the fragile structures we built and now see being ripped down around us, weren’t a gigantic waste of our productive years, better spent at making money to trickle down, or to invest up into the supply-side of the market. That’s part of why I can curb my envy for your youth. Like us, you will make mistakes, you will spend your precious guts on causes that lose appeal, programs that flounder, and processes that backfire, you will misdiagnose and mistreat social ills. Maybe you too will get “burnt out” -- a favorite epithet of my era -- and wonder why, or for what? The pendulum will swing many times during your lifetime — on political parties and ideologies, economic and social theories, art, books, fashion, cults, and each swing will carry with it some part of your life’s blood and energies.

But in the last analysis, that may be what it is really about — being a part of one’s times, not merely living in them. We are not all blessed with the foresight to know what we are doing is right and. good in the long run; we are often wrong; it is only necessary that we not default for lack of trying.

We already know that the activism of the sixties and early seventies will not be the model for effective participation in the eighties: If there is one certain fact we face today it is the nation’s rejection of the political and social techniques of a whole generation; Your job will be to redesign the processes of democracy as you preserve its substance in an era when big money, intrusive media, run-away technology and restrictive ideologies could swiftly overwhelm you. Now is the time for all good skeptics to come to the aid of their country. I would counsel you to doubt that any ideology has all the answers, that any single religious or moral viewpoint has the right to pass judgment on the most intimate thoughts and actions of the rest of us. Humility and caution are not to be confused with weakness; the rhetoric of righteousness and arrogance too often masks the voice of hypocrisy that chants: “Do not look at what we — only listen to what we say.” It’s your country, the only one you’ve got and if you’re going to get out and run it, confront injustice, press for change, you’re going to need patience and toughness and tolerance and most of all durability. There will be times — and they may seem interminable — when you and your deepest convictions will be out of sync with the times — when, as now, talk of compassion, human dignity, personal liberty, privacy, mutual respect and justice may seen unfashionable, even faintly subversive, when the temptation to retreat into your own life, lick your wounds, let them have their way, worse still, to join the groupies who run always with the pack, will seem irresistible. It takes strength and endurance to live through it and keep going; to build and preserve and to survive in bad times as well as good.

And ironically the hazards of success may be as real and more insidious than those of failure. Heady, exciting, romantic policymaking jobs — if they come your way — are short-lived; the drudgery lives on. For every day in the limelight there will be a year in the prosaic, mundane shadows. Washington -- and every other power center — is full of people whose brief period near the summit so dominated their lives that they could never subsequently reconcile themselves to the humbler levels of working reality. And that reality will bear down painfully on your private as well as your public lives. Allow me a sexist diversion. The women among you will forge new patterns of career and motherhood. (I do not want to suggest that men graduates’ lives will be the same as their fathers’, either.) Few will be immune from the frightening pangs of parenthood; the omnipresent feeling that you cannot be both parent and professional; the terror that the world and career will pass you by.

Family and career can interlock for twenty-years — as many years again as you have now lived. It is a tough, frustrating, sometimes destructive time. The price of failure is great in human terms. Our businesses and professions do not yet recognize and credit the relentless demands that life makes on women; they persist in talking about “choices that no one should have to make. For all of you — men and women — no aspect of your lives will be more important than the middle years with your husbands, lovers, children, and the way your careers support or corrode those relationships. Professional life, once the province of workaholic men and the wives and children they neglected or abandoned along the way, now has its counterpart population of women performing the same rite. The novitiate bent over the account books until three a.m. is just as likely a she as a he nowadays. Has she the patience to wait five years to enter the corporate scramble, or lose five rungs on the bureaucratic ladder for the sake of her child? Whether one chooses to stay home for several years or to return to work almost immediately, the amount of time, energy, and emotional commitment children need from their parents, is limitless and all-consuming. The balance that must be struck is different for everyone, but for those who choose to drop out for a while, great patience, tolerance and self-subordination is required. My only words to those of you who choose that course are, it can be done, it has been done, I believe it is worth doing. I know few who consciously made the choice that have not caught up with their peers and — more significantly none who regretted the choice. The time is not wasted — even from a professional view; certainly not from a human point of view. As women enter the mainstream of public and commercial life in increasing numbers they need not clone the working habits and personal traits of men who came before them. There are new career patterns and personal relationships your generation has to forge, to conserve the gains women have made in the last decade without sacrificing the best parts of family life. The wonderful thing is that you can develop and refine the talent of a business-person, a government leader, an international trader, a media personality, a labor leader, a poverty crusader, or a political reformer in almost any milieu, including the kitchen and the nursery. You can build your own career ladders; you need not always climb the ones others have put in place. As you grow older, you will, I think, tend more and more to trust your gut-instincts about what to do with your life. It often means taking risks in favor of your personal over your professional life; going somewhere else when your spouse’s opportunity is golden and yours is only brass. It is harder now than in my time. The stereotype of the successful couple -- one worldly achiever, one loyal housebound supporter — is no longer true. Both partners — now — want to achieve some; both have to support some. Sometimes I think the women’s movement has concentrated too much on its superstars and achievers — by career standards — and not enough on the balances that must be drawn for women between the vital roles they play as wives and mothers and the need and right they have to participate in and contribute to the world around them.

Seldom do we get to pick the parts we play in life — for the most part they are written as we go along. I am convinced that planning one’s career — if indeed it works at all — is an invitation to an uneventful and dull life. The only package we have to offer the world is the combination of ourselves, our skills, our intellect, our sensitivity to people and situations, our deep, core values, our commitment to doing whatever we have to do well and with grace and style. I am not sure where, when, or how one learns to put these qualities together; a truly liberal education at least introduces college students to examples in life and literature of how others have done or tried to do it well. Perhaps you will find — like me — that apart from the sense of wanting to do, to be, to accomplish — you bring away from Connecticut a taste for, good fiction, good art and theatre and movies. It is often only the single splendid insight from an absorbing novel, a fine film, an inspired painting, an heroic sculpture that leads us through the tedious morass of details that fill our days to the essence of what we want our lives to be about. But the most valuable legacy college can leave you Is an appetite and appreciation of language. Clarity, lucidity, precision with words is the most elusive of talents. Words inform, inspire, mislead and sometimes destroy. They are the most essential tool of humanity. Words plan, build, preserve, and often demolish civilizations, industries, empires, governments, and relationships. If you carry one lesson from college to life, let it be the knowledge that what you say is the expression of what you mean, what you intend to provoke in others, what you want to realize. I do not think it is happenstance that freedom of speech is the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; it is the stuff of which revolutions and nations and civilizations are made. But that basic freedom carries basic responsibilities. Select carefully your own words — they tell the world who you are, what you are, what you know, whether you are swift or slow, knowledgeable or uninformed, careful or loose, credible or flaky, trustworthy or threatening. In most careers and jobs — from answering telephones, to running a corporation, your use of words is as important as the fund of substantive knowledge they describe.

As a practicing lawyer, I worked mainly to define the civil rights of citizens in the grip of poverty and disadvantage; as a judge 90 percent of my time is spent defining the economic rights of citizens in the regulatory grip of departments and agencies of government. Language was the bridge.

Whatever course you choose, get used to loneliness. No one who stands for anything can expect steadily to be swarmed by admirers. The whole world doesn’t love you, no matter how lovable you are — so make alienation worthwhile. We move from scene to scene, the cast of characters constantly changes, and no one — even those closest to us — ever fully understands or empathizes with our motives and our fears, our inspirations and our demons. Approbation is a will-of-the-wisp -- don’t court it abjectly. Be your own toughest critic; know your own strength but ruthlessly -- if privately -- recognize your own weaknesses. Don’t let the other fellow define your limits; set them yourself. I think I have sermonized enough. Throughout life, I know you will find much strength and much pleasure in the memory of these years you conclude today. 

Robert Frost once wrote:
Don’t join too many gangs. Join few if any.
Join the United States and join the family —
But not much in between unless a college.

You will remember; the first serious personal relationships you found in this College; the first intellectual thrill; the first time you were recognized for your writing, your reasoning or your creativity; the first time you drove yourself beyond your limits — physical, intellectual, or emotional — to accomplish something; the first time you sensed power from something you did; the first time you realized you had not met your own newly found standards. These will be with you thirty years later. You will remember the professor who permanently touched your personality and sensibilities. Mine was a government professor named Miss Dilley who demanded more than any 18 year old had to give, and rewarded her diligent failures; an English teacher names Mr. Smyser who opened a whole new world of literary realism to a small town girl from Torrington, Connecticut; a history teacher named Mr. Haynes who made medieval history a preview of the bizarre events of 1948—1981.

If the prospects beyond 1981 seem depressing, then let them be challenging and exciting as well. When those in power speak over-confidently, do not be cowed. The burden and joy of a liberal arts education is the realization that you can control so much of your own lives. Don’t let others tell you how to vote, how to behave, how to govern your most intimate relationships, or what to feel, what to fear -- on what basis to judge people -- what to revere and what to dread. Diversity — tolerance — above all doubt — carry these into the rest of your lives. At the point when you stop being irritated, idiosyncratic, irascible, idealistic, at the point when you are content listlessly to accept and conform, you have lost control. That is really the heart of the matter, and basically all an aging member of the class of 1948 has to say to the fledgling class of 1981.

One of you will probably be up here on this same platform in 2001, self-consciously applauding or apologizing for your generation’s triumphs and tragedies. To that person and to your whole class I wish good luck — good fortune — good times — and Godspeed.

Let us ask our Lady to be with us, so that we can thank God for the beautiful gifts that He has given to all of us, in giving us hearts to love her, and Jesus above all, to follow, and to be His own.  Mary, Mother of Jesus, give us your love, your heart, so beautiful, so pure, so immaculate, your heart so full of love and humility, that we may be able to love Jesus as you loved Him, and serve Him in the distressing disguise of the poor.

It is a wonderful day for our young people, today, to be sent.  Jesus on this day sent the Holy Spirit among His apostles, and He gave them the wonderful word, “Go.”  “Go and preach the good news.”  Go and preach the news that God is Love, and that God loves you.  And today you are being sent, and it is such a beautiful day today, the Feast of Love, the Feast that we have learned that He loves us.  And Jesus has kept His promise.  “When I go, it is good for you that I go, because I will send the Spirit.”  And that goodness has been prepared today.  And for you, who have received your graduation, not for you only, you have received something beautiful so that you make your life something beautiful for God.  You have received many things to guide you, protect you, to lead you in the right paths.  Remember that it has been given to you, not to keep, but to share.  The greatest grace:  share gift.  Jesus has told us what to do.  “Love one another as I have loved you.”  Nothing more and nothing less.  He expects us to do, to love as He loved.  And He said also that “by this love for one another, they will know that you are mine, that you are my disciples.”  Because we read in the Scriptures that God proclaimed His love for us when He said: “I called you by your name.  You are mine.  Water will not drown you.  Fire will not burn you.  I will give up nations for you.  You are precious to me.  I love you.  I love you so much.  I curl you up in the palm of my hand.  Even if mother could forget her child, I will not forget you.  I have curled you in the palm of my hand.”

And so you young people, who are going out today with the conviction that He loves you, that you are somebody very precious for Himself, that you are a child of God.  And therefore, love others as He loves you.  And how do we love God?  How do you love God?  How do you share His love with others?  Again Jesus has explained, “Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it to me.”  To the hungry, to the naked, to the homeless, to the unwanted, to the unloved, to the sick, to they dying – “You do it to me.”  And it is so beautiful to think that we can love God tenderly, lovingly, intimately, personally.  How?  By loving, by loving others.  And where does this love begin?  In our own home.  And if you really, if you really want to love, as Jesus has loved us, we need to pray, for prayer gives us a clean heart, and a clean heart can see God.  And how do we pray?  God speaks in the silence of the heart.  Listen, as the beginning of prayer.  In the silence of the heart, God speaks, and we listen, and then, from the fullness of our hearts, we speak.  And that listening and that speaking is prayer.  And if it, if we pray like that, then our hearts are clean, and if our hearts are clean, we will see one another, we will, in one another, we will see the face of God.  Jesus said:  “Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.”  And so, that, that love for one another cleanses the heart.  It is a wonderful and beautiful gift of God for us, and cared by you young people.

You are going out.  You will meet suffering.  You will meet humiliation.  You will meet sorrow.  You will meet joy.  You will meet success.  You will be wanted.  You will be unwanted.  You will be loved.  You will not be loved.  All that is part of Jesus’ fate.  “Pick up the cross and follow me.”  “And follow me.”  We don’t have to go ahead of Him.  And to be able to do that, He has made Himself bread of life, to give us life, to satisfy our hunger for God.  And then He makes himself the hungry One, so that you and I can satisfy His hunger for our love.  So it is wonderful when we come to know that Love.  Again I say, love begins at home.  The family that prays together, stays together.  And if you stay together, you will love one another as Jesus loves each one of us.

For a young man to really love a young woman, and a young woman to love, to love a young man, is beautiful.  It is a gift of God.  But, love with a clean heart.  Love each other with a virgin love.  Love each other by keeping a virgin and pure body and soul, so that on the day you get married, as the Scripture says:  “Husband and wife will cleave to each other, and they become one.”  So that on that day of cleaving, you can give each other a virgin heart, a virgin body, a virgin soul.  This is that the gift of God for you.  And if a mistake is made, do not destroy the child.  Do not kill the child.  The child is needed, created the image of God.  Both of you accept the child.  Accept, and take care of that child.  It is a child of God.  It is God’s own creation, beautiful creation.  Like today, we hear so much of abortion, of the killing, of murdering, of destruction.  Today they will destroy the fetus in abortion.  And so let us make one resolution that, in this beautiful city, we will not allow a single man, a single woman, a single child, born or unborn, be unwanted, unloved, uncared.  Why?  Because they are Jesus in the distressing disguise.

And if Jesus comes in your life, and wants you then to follow Him, as a priest or as a religious, have the courage to say:  “Yes,” for He loves you tenderly.  He is offering you His lifelong, faithful, personal friendship, in tenderness and love, so that you can be His own priest or His own spouse.  Because gift from heaven, gift from God, that for you and for me He has always prepared, that you may be able to be only all for Him.

Love the poor.  Do you know the poor of your place, of your city?  Find them.  Maybe they are right in your own family.  The poor are the gift of God for us.  They are great people.  They are very lovable people.  I remember one day I picked up a man from an open drain.  His body was full of maggots.  And I brought him to our home.  What did he say?  He did not curse.  He didn’t blame.  He did not scream.  He just said beautifully:  “I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to die like an angel, loved and cared.”  After three hours – it took us three hours to clean him – and after three hours, he just – such a beautiful smile on his face – and he just went home to God.  For death is nothing but going home to God.  And that man, who had lived in the open drain, surrounded with dirt and worms and so on, he went home to God with a big smile.

And here, right here, in your own country, you must remember, there must be the lonely, the unwanted.  What do you call them?  “Shut-ins.”  Do you know where they are?  What do you do for them?  Maybe you are not able to do now.  But now that you are finished, try to remember that they are lonely people.  Hunger is not only for a piece of bread.  Hunger is for love.  Hunger is for the Word of God.  I remember when we went to Mexico, opened a house, and the people where the Sisters were.  We were among the poorest of the poor, and we could see that they didn’t have many things.  And yet, nobody asked us for anything.  They said:  “Teach us the Word of God,” and were hungry for the Word of God.  Nakedness is not only for a piece of cloth.  Nakedness is that for the human dignity, for that respect.  Homelessness is not only for a home made of bricks.  Homelessness is that being rejected, unwanted, unloved, uncared, having forgotten what is human love, what is human touch.  I’ll never forget one day I met a man in one of those big cities, and I just went close to him, and I shook his hand, and he took hold of my hand for a long time.  “For so many years … I feel the warmth of a human hand.”  After so many years, it meant such a lot to him, with such a beautiful smile on his face.  Why?  Because after so many years, there was somebody who cared.  So let us try to find, ask, ask Our Lady for she, when she missed Jesus, she went in haste to look for Him.  And so, begging, let us ask her to go with us so that we will be able, with her, to find Jesus in the distressing disguise, and bring Him home, bring Him back to our own love, to our own heart, and do to them what we really believe we are doing to Jesus.  That this is a conviction.  Jesus has said:  “Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do unto me.  I was hungry, you gave me to eat.  I was naked, you clothed me.  I was homeless, you took me in.”

My prayer for you is that you grow in the likeness of Christ, to love for each other.  And you pray for us, pray for our Sisters and Brothers, that we really, really realize that we are not social workers.  We may be doing social work, but we are not social workers.  But we are real contemplatives in the heart of the world, because we are twenty-four hours with Jesus in the hungry, in the naked, in the sick, in the homeless.

May God bless you and keep you.  And today when you leave this place with something beautiful in your hands, make sure that you make your life really something beautiful for God.  God bless you!


I am of course overjoyed to be here today in the role of ceremonial object. There is more than the usual amount of satisfaction in receiving an honorary degree from the university that helped to form one’s erstwhile callow and ignorant mind into the thing of dubious splendor that it is today; whose professors put up with so many overdue term papers, and struggled to read one’s handwriting, of which ‘interesting’ is the best that has been said; at which one failed to learn Anglo-Saxon and somehow missed Bibliography entirely, a severe error which I trust no one present here today has committed; and at which one underwent excruciating agonies not only of soul but of body, later traced to having drunk too much coffee in the bowels of Wymilwood.

It is to Victoria College that I can attribute the fact that Bell Canada, Oxford University Press and McClelland and Stewart all failed to hire me in the summer of ‘63, on the grounds that I was a) overqualified and b) couldn’t type, thus producing in me that state of joblessness, angst and cosmic depression which everyone knows is indispensable for novelists and poets, although nobody has ever claimed the same for geologists, dentists or chartered accountants. It is also due to Victoria College, incarnated in the person of Northrop Frye, that I didn’t run away to England to become a waitress, live in a garret, write masterpieces and get tuberculosis. He thought I might have more spare time for creation if I ran away to Boston, lived in a stupor, wrote footnotes and got anxiety attacks, that is, if I went to Graduate School, and he was right. So, for all the benefits conferred upon me by my Alma Mater, where they taught me that the truth would make me free but failed to warn me of the kind of trouble I’d get into by trying to tell it - I remain duly grateful.

But everything has its price. No sooner had I tossed off a graceful reply to the letter inviting me to be present today than I began to realize the exorbitance of what was expected of me. I was going to have to come up with something to say,“You may not be able to alter reality, but you can alter your attitude towards it, and this, paradoxically, alters reality. Try it and see.”to a graduating class in 1983, year of the Ph.D. taxi driver, when young people have unemployment the way they used to have ugly blackheads; something presumably useful, wise, filled with resonance and overview, helpful, encouraging and optimistic. After all, you are being launched - though ever since I experienced the process, I’ve wondered why “convocation” is the name for it. “Ejection” would be better. Even in the best of times, it’s more or less like being pushed over a cliff, and these are not the best of times. In case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m here to tell you that it’s an armpit out there. As for your university degree, there are definitely going to be days when you will feel that you’ve been given a refrigerator and sent to the middle of a jungle, where there are no three-pronged grounded plugholes.

Not only that, the year will come when you will wake up in the middle of the night and realize that the people you went to school with are in positions of power, and may soon actually be running things. If there’s anything more calculated to thick men’s blood with cold, it’s that. After all, you know how much they didn’t know then, and, given yourself as an example, you can’t assume they know a great deal more now. “We’re all doomed,” you will think. (For example: Brian Mulroney is only a year older than I am.) You may feel that the only thing to do when you’ve reached this stage is to take up nail-biting, mantras, or jogging, all of which would be recognized by animal behavior specialists as substitution activities, like scratching, which are resorted to in moments of unresolved conflict. But we’ll get around to some positive thinking in a moment.

“What shall I tell them!” I thought, breaking out into a cold sweat, as I tossed and turned night after night. (Lest you leap to indulge in Calvinistic guilt at the idea of having been the proximate cause of my discomfort, let me hasten to add that I was on a boat. The tossing and turning was par for the course, and the cold sweat can be cured by Gravol). For a while I toyed with the idea of paraphrasing Kurt Vonnegut, who told one graduating class, “Everything is going to become unbelievably worse and will never get better again,” and walked off the stage. But that’s the American style: boom or bust. A Canadian would be more apt to say, “things may be pretty mediocre but let’s at least try to hold the line.”

Then I thought that maybe I could say a few words on the subject of a liberal arts education, and how it prepares you for life. But sober reflection led me to the conclusion that this topic too was a washout; for, as you will soon discover, a liberal arts education doesn’t exactly prepare you for life. A preparation-for-life curriculum would not consist of courses on Victorian Thought and French Romanticism, but of things like How to Cope With Marital Breakdown, Getting More for your Footwear Dollar, Dealing With Stress, and How To Keep Your Fingernails from Breaking Off by Always Filing Them Towards the Center; in other words, it would read like the contents page of Homemakers Magazine, which is why Homemakers Magazine is so widely read, even by me. Or, for boys, Forbes or The Economist , and Improving Your Place in the Power Hierarchy by Choosing the Right Suit. (Dark blue with a faint white pinstripe, not too far apart, in case you’re interested.)

Or maybe, I thought, I should expose glaring errors in the educational system, or compile a list of things I was taught which are palpably not true. For instance, in high school I made the mistake of taking Home Economics instead of Typing - we thought, in those days, that if you took the commercial course most of your eyebrows would come off and would have to be drawn on with a pencil for the rest of your life - where I was told that every meal should consist of a brown thing, a white thing, a yellow thing and a green thing; that it was not right to lick the spoon while cooking; and that the inside of a dress seam was as important as the outside. All three of these ideas are false and should be discarded immediately by anyone who still holds them.

Nor did anyone have the foresight to inform me that the best thing I could do for myself as a writer would be back and wrist exercises. No one has yet done a study of this, but they will, and when they start excavating and measuring the spines and arm bones of the skeletons of famous writers of the past I am sure they will find that those who wrote the longest novels, such as Dickens and Melville, also had the thickest wrists. The real reason that Emily Dickinson stuck to lyric poems with relatively few stanzas is that she had spindly fingers. You may scoff, but future research will prove me right.

But I then thought, I shouldn’t talk about writing. Few of this graduating class will wish to be writers, and those that do should by no means be encouraged. Weave a circle round them thrice, and close your eyes holy dread, because who needs the competition? What with the proliferation of Creative Writing courses, a mushroom of recent growth all but unknown in my youth, we will soon have a state of affairs in which everybody writes and nobody reads, the exact reverse of the way things were when I was composing dolorous verses in a rented cupboard on Charles Street in the early sixties.

Or maybe, I thought, I should relate to them a little known fact of shocking import, which they will remember vividly when they have all but forgotten the rest of this speech. For example: nobody ever tells you, but did you know that when you have a baby your hair falls out? Not all of it, and not all at once, but it does fall out. It has something to do with a zinc imbalance. The good news is that it does grow back in. This only applies to girls. With boys, it falls out whether you have a baby or not, and it never grows back in; but even then there is hope. In a pinch, you can resort to quotation, a commodity which a liberal arts education teaches you to treat with respect, and I offer the following: “God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest lie covered with hair.”

Which illustrates the following point: when faced with the inevitable, you always have a choice. You may not be able to alter reality, but you can alter your attitude towards it. As I learned during my liberal arts education, any symbol can have, in the imaginative context, two versions, a positive and a negative. Blood can either be the gift of life or what comes out of you when you cut your wrists in the bathtub. Or, somewhat less drastically, if you spill your milk you’re left with a glass which is either half empty or half full.

Which brings us to the hidden agenda of this speech. What you are being ejected into today is a world that is both half empty and half full. On the one hand, the biosphere is rotting away. The raindrops that keep falling on your head are also killing the fish, the trees, the animals, and, if they keep being as acid as they are now, they’ll eventually do away with things a lot closer to home, such as crops, front lawns and your digestive tract. Nature is no longer what surrounds us, we surround it, and the switch has not been for the better. On the other hand, unlike the ancient Egyptians, we as a civilization know what mistakes we are making and we also have the technology to stop making them; all that is lacking is the will.

Another example: on the one hand, we ourselves live daily with the threat of annihilation. We’re just a computer button and a few minutes away from it, and the gap between us and it is narrowing every day. We secretly think in terms not of “If the Bomb Drops” but of “When the Bomb Drops”, and it’s understandable if we sometimes let ourselves slide into a mental state of powerlessness and consequent apathy. On the other hand, the catastrophe that threatens us as a species, and most other species as well, is not unpredictable and uncontrollable, like the eruption of the volcano that destroyed Pompeii. If it occurs, we can die with the dubious satisfaction of knowing that the death of the world was a man-made and therefore preventable event, and that the failure to prevent it was a failure of human will.

This is the kind of world we find ourselves in, and it’s not pleasant. Faced with facts this depressing, the question of the economy - or how many of us in this country can afford two cars doesn’t really loom too large, but you’d never know it from reading the papers. Things are in fact a lot worse elsewhere, where expectations center not on cars and houses and jobs but on the next elusive meal. That’s part of the down side. The up side, here and now, is that this is still more or less a democracy; you don’t get shot or tortured yet for expressing an opinion, and politicians, motivated as they may be by greed and the lust for power, are nevertheless or because of this, still swayed by public opinion. The issues raised in any election are issues perceived by those who want power to be of importance to those in a position to confer it upon them. In other words, if enough people show by the issues they raise and by the way they’re willing to vote that they want changes made, then change becomes possible. You may not be able to alter reality, but you can alter your attitude towards it, and this, paradoxically, alters reality.

Try it and see.

In high school there’s generally one acceptable way to be, and it’s dictated by the exigencies of dating. There are the people who try to be that way, and then there are the other, clunky, disastrously uncool individuals, the nerds, who swim upstream in those waters.

Real Life is actually a lot more like high school. The common denominator prevails. Excellence is not always recognized or rewarded. What we watch on our screens, whom we elect, are determined to a large extent by public polls. Looks count. A lot. And unlike the best of the college experience, when ideas and solutions somehow seem attainable if you just get up early, stay up late, try hard enough, and find the right source or method, things on the outside sometimes seem vast and impossible, and settling, resigning oneself, or hiding and hunkering down becomes the best way of getting along.

Why did you ask me here to speak? What do you think I know? Or, what do I represent that you want to know about? When I asked myself that, I said, "Okay, you represent success to them. You went to Vassar, got out, and did what you wanted to do and are richly rewarded for it. Two Oscars, two kids, almost. They asked you here to speak because they imagine you know why this happened to you. They imagine it could happen to them, too, and please, could you please tell them how to set things up so that it does. Also, some of them would like to know how tall Dustin Hoffman is, and what does it feel like to kiss Robert DeNiro?" (You’ll never know.)

What I would like to tell you about today is the unsuccessful part, unsuccessful in that I’m not finished with it yet. That is, the part of Real Life for which Vassar did begin to prepare me: the investigation of my motives along the way, the process of making choices, and the struggle to maintain my integrity, such as it is, in a business that asks me to please just strip it off sometimes. I know I started from home with an advantage. My Father’s romantic heart and my Mother’s great, good, common sense gave me a head start. But what you can take away from Vassar is a taste for excellence that needn’t diminish. Sometimes I’ve wished it would go away, because some so-called important scripts are so illiterate, and the money is *so* good, that I’ve been tempted to toss all my acquired good taste, and hustle. But there’s always the knowledge, and this is from experience, that the work itself is the reward, and if I choose challenging work, it’ll pay me back with interest. At least I’ll be interested, even if nobody else is. That choice, between the devil and the dream, comes up every day in different little disguises. I’m sure it comes up in every field of endeavor and every life. My advice is to look the dilemma in the face and decide what you can live with. If you can live with the devil, Vassar hasn’t sunk her teeth into your leg the way she did mine. But that conscience, that consciousness of quality, and the need to demand it can galvanize your energies, not just in your work, but in a rigorous exercise of mind and heart in every aspect of your life. I firmly believe that this engagement in the attempt for excellence is what sustains the most well lived and satisfying, successful lives.

When I first came to New York seven years ago, I lived on West 69th Street near the park. I got three bills a month - the rent, the electric, and the phone. I had my two brothers and four or five close friends to talk to, some acquaintances, and everybody was single. I kept a diary. I read three newspapers and the New York Review of Books. I read books, I took afternoon naps before performances and stayed out till two and three, talking about acting with actors in actors’ bars.

I now have nine million bills a month. I have met more people in this short career of mine than Shakespeare and Dante met in their entire lives. My brothers, my friends are married with kids, divorced or living with people. I go to bed between 9:30 and 10 p.m. The network of my concerns and responsibilities has extended way, way beyond anything I could have imagined back then.

What I’m telling you is that it goes so fast, and gets so complicated so quickly, that remembering who you are and how you got there and what you really, really care about takes a hard, and frequent shake-up effort. Add to this the hyperbolic life of celebrity, the intrusion of extreme self-consciousness onto every public utterance, and you have the reason that I turned down this opportunity to speak several times in the past few years. You have the reason that many people who make it big very often hide and hunker down. Take care of their business. Don’t extend themselves beyond the pressing demands of a major career, which will devour any amount of time that you want to give it.

But I’ve found as this network expands and my responsibilities multiply, so does my own stake in the future of the world, and instead of feeling the desire to keep quiet, I feel the need to demand the best of our leaders, to secure the quality of the life my children will live into the next century, to secure the FACT of their survival into the next century. In other words, to take it seriously I must obey this incentive to excellence – not just in making a scene work, but in making The Scene, in participating fully and taking on the responsibilities we all share as citizens of the earth.

When I was going to California for the Academy Awards, my Dad called and said, "If you win, when you get up there, keep it short, sparkling, and nonpolitical." I told him my dress would sparkle enough for both of us, and if I could get up at all at that moment, I promised I wouldn’t say one word about the bomb. That’s a nice-sized audience, three hundred million people, and the desire to say whatever you want to say to everybody on earth in two minutes is strong. However, on that occasion I could see his point about what was appropriate to the moment. But when he gave me the same advice today, I had to disagree. Because we are all political actors, aren’t we, to be judged by our sins of omission as well as commission, by our silence as much as by our expressed opinions, by what we let slide as much as by the things we stand up for.

I’ve tried to count the number of interviews I’ve done lately with very well meaning, well educated journalists whose purported interest was in getting to the Real Me, my most private concerns, my innermost thoughts. My records are really bad, but in the United States, I’ve had over 123 such encounters. Recently, I traveled to Europe to publicize Sophie’s Choice, and met over 35 journalists there in four weeks. This process is sometimes fun, and sometimes really boring. The questions are basically the same on both sides of the Atlantic, with one startling difference. In Europe, as a matter of course, along with, "How do you manage to combine family and career?" and "How does your husband handle your success?" and "How do you pick your scripts?" and "What is your real hair color?" there would inevitably be a category of questions on the state of the world. It was just assumed, without any embarrassment at all, that as a member of the human race I had one or two thoughts on the subject. This from Swedes and Spaniards, Italians, Germans, English and French. Everybody. Everybody but the home team. Now why is that? The American journalists never ask you that, or, if they do, they invariably make some crack about Jane Fonda.

I think we feel in this country that it’s "inappropriate" for even the most vaguely expressed political views to intrude on what should be short, sparkling, and entertaining. Anyhow, I’m not going to try to make you share my political views today, but I do exhort you to investigate your own and follow through on them. Even at inappropriate gatherings like this.

Integrate what you believe into every single area of your life. Take your heart to work, and ask the most and best of everybody else too. Don’t let your special character and values, the secret that you know and no one else does, the truth – don’t let that get swallowed up by the great chewing complacency.

Good luck, and welcome to the Big Time.

This is my first commencement, and I think it’s a wonderful college to be having it. I liked hearing a woman chaplain give in invocation; I admire your distinguished and extraordinary President; and I agree heartily with the content of the two speeches, especially their upfront feminist sentiments, just delivered by two graduating seniors…

Graduation is one of the few genuine rites of passage left in our society. You are, individually and collectively, passing symbolically from one place to another, from an old to a new status. And, like all such rites, it is both retrospective and prospective. You are graduating (or being graduated) from college, which is the end of something. But the ceremony we are participating in is called commencement.

That necessarily seasonal, minor literary form called the “commencement address” also faces in two directions. It usually starts with an analysis of the society or the era—appropriately pessimistic. It generally concludes with a heavy dose of exhortation, in which the young graduates, after having been suitably alarmed, are nevertheless urged to be of good cheer as they go forth into the arena of struggle that is your life, and this world.

As a writer, therefore fascinated by genres, as well as an American, and therefore prone to sermonizing, I shall respect the tradition. The times we live in are indeed alarming. It is a time of the most appalling escalation of violence—violence to the environment, both “nature” and “culture;” violence to all living beings. A time in which an ideology of exterminism, institutionalized in the nuclear arms race, has gained increasing credence—threatening life itself. It is also a time of a vertiginous drop in cultural standards, of virulent anti-intellectualism, and of triumphant mediocrity—a mediocrity that characterizes the educational system that you have just passed through, or has passed you through (for all the efforts and good will of many of your teachers). Trivializing standards, using as their justification the ideal of democracy, have made the very idea of a serious humanist education virtually unintelligible to most people. A vast system of mental lobotomization has been put into operation that sets the standards to which all accede. (I am speaking, of course, of American television.)

A singularly foolish and incompetent president sets the tone for an extraordinary regression in public ideals, strengthening apathy and a sense of hopelessness before the self-destructive course of foreign policy and the arms race. The best critical impulses in our society—such as that which has give rise to feminist consciousness—are under vicious attack. An increasing propaganda for conformism in morals and in art instructs us that originality and individuality will always be defeated, and simply do not pay. There is a strengthening of the power of censors within and without. The constraints which govern us in this society have little in common with the grim normalcy of totalitarian societies. Our society does not censor as totalitarian societies do; on the contrary, our society promises liberty, self-fulfillment, and self-expression. But many features of our so-called culture have as their goal and result the reduction of our mental life, or our mental operation; and this is precisely, I would argue, what censorship is about. Censorship does not exist in order to keep secrets. The secrets that censors target, such as sex, are usually open secrets. Censorship is a formal principle. It has no predetermined subject. It exists in order to promote and defend power against the challenge of individuality. It exists in order to maintain optimism, to suppress pessimism; that is to give pessimism—which often means truthfulness—a bad conscience.

Of course, the grim assessments of our era—such as I have just outlined—can themselves become a species of conformity. But only if we have too simple a sense of our lives. Whenever we speak, we tend to make matters sound simpler than they are, and than we know they are.

I have said that this rite of passage—commencement—is one that faces in two directions. Your old status and your new status. The past and the present. The present and the future. But I would urge that it is not just a description of today’s exercises but a model for how you should try to live. As if you were always graduating, ending, and, simultaneously, always beginning. And your sense of the world, and of the large amount of life before you, also should face in two directions. It is true that the macro-news—the news about the world—is bad.
It is also true that your news may not be bad; indeed, that you have a duty not to let it be as bad for you. Perhaps the main point of knowing a rule is to be an exception to it.

If your liberal arts education has meant anything, it has given you some notions of a critical opposition to the way things are (and are generally defined—for example, for you as women.) This attitude of opposition is not justified as a strategy, as a means to an end, a way of changing the world. It is, rather, the best way of being in the world.

As individuals we are never outside of some system which bestows significance. But we can become aware that our lives consist: both really and potentially, of many systems. That we always have choices, options—and that it is a failure of imagination (or fantasy) not to perceive this. The large system of significance in which we live is called “culture.” In that sense, no one is without a culture. But in a stricter sense, culture is not a given but an achievement, that we have to work at all our lives. Far from being given, culture is something we have to strive to protect against all incursions. Culture is the opposite of provinciality—the provinciality of the intellect, and the provinciality of the heart. (Far from being merely national, or local, it is properly international.) The highest culture is self-critical and makes us suspicious and critical of state power.

The liberal arts education you have received is not a luxury, as some of you may think, but a necessity- and more. For there is an intrinsic connection between a liberal arts education, by which I mean an education in the traditions and methods of “high” culture, and the very existence of liberty. Liberty means the right to diversity, to difference; the right to difficulty. It is the study of history and philosophy- it’s the love of arts, in all the non-linear complexity of their traditions- that teaches us that.

Perhaps the most useful suggestion I can make on the day when most of you are ceasing to be students, is that you go on being students- for the rest of your lives. Don’t move to a mental slum.

If you go on being students, if you do not consider you have graduated and that your schooling is done, perhaps you can at least save yourselves and thereby make a space for others, in which they too can resist the pressures to conformity, the public drone and the inner and outer censors- such as those who tell you that you belong to a “post-feminist generation.”

There are other counsels that might be useful. But if I had to restrict myself to just one, I would want to praise the virtue of obstinacy. (This is something anyone who is a writer knows a good deal about: for without obstinacy, or stubbornness, or tenacity, or pigheadedness, nothing gets written.) For whatever you want to do, if it has any quality or distinction or creativity- or, as women, if it defies sexual stereotypes- you can be sure that most people and many institutions will be devoted to encouraging you not to do it. If you want to do creative work- if you want, even though women, to lead unservile lives- there will be many obstacles. And you will have many excuses. These do not mitigate the failure. “Whatever prevents you from doing your work,” a writer once observed, “has become your work.”

All counsels of courage usually contain, at the end, a counsel of prudence. In Spenser’s The Faerie Queen, Book III, there is a place called the Castle of Busyrane, on whose outer gate is written BE BOLD, and on the second gate, BE BOLD, BE BOLD, and on the inner iron door, BE NOT TOO BOLD.

This is not the advice I am giving. I would urge you to be as imprudent as you dare. BE BOLD, BE BOLD, BE BOLD. Keep on reading. (Poetry. And novels from 1700 to 1940.) Lay off the television. And, remember when you hear yourself saying one day that you don’t have time any more to read- or listen to music, or look at painting, or go to the movies, or do whatever feeds you head now- then you’re getting old. That means they got to you, after all.

I wish you Love. Courage. And Fantasy.

I want to thank the Mills College Class of ’83 for offering me a rare chance: to speak aloud in public in the language of women.

I know there are men graduating, and I don’t mean to exclude them, far from it. There is a Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner, “If you don’t understand Greek, please signify by nodding.” Anyhow, commencements are usually operated under the unspoken agreement that everybody graduating is either male or ought to be. That’s why we are all wearing these twelfth-century dresses that look so great on men and make women look either like a mushroom or a pregnant stork. Intellectual tradition is male. Public speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men’s language. Of course women learn it. We’re not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything they say, tell me how. This is a man’s world, so it talks a man’s language. The words are all words of power. You’ve come a long way, baby, but no way is long enough. You can’t even get there by selling yourself out: because there is theirs, not yours.

Maybe we’ve had enough words of power and talk about the battle of life. Maybe we need some words of weakness. Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go forth from this ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a triumphant career or at least help your husband to and keep our country strong and be a success in everything - instead of talking about power, what if I talked like a woman right here in public? It won’t sound right. It’s going to sound terrible. What if I said what I hope for you is first, if — only if — you want kids, I hope you have them. Not hordes of them. A couple, enough. I hope they’re beautiful. I hope you and they have enough to eat, and a place to be warm and clean in, and friends, and work you like doing. Well, is that what you went to college for? Is that all? What about success?

Success is somebody else’s failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success. I don’t even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure.

Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find you’re weak where you thought yourself strong. You’ll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself — as I know you already have — in dark places, alone, and afraid.

What I hope for you, for all my sisters and daughters, brothers and sons, is that you will be able to live there, in the dark place. To live in the place that our rationalizing culture of success denies, calling it a place of exile, uninhabitable, foreign.

Well, we’re already foreigners. Women as women are largely excluded from, alien to, the self-declared male norms of this society, where human beings are called Man, the only respectable god is male, the only direction is up. So that’s their country; let’s explore our own. I’m not talking about sex; that’s a whole other universe, where every man and woman is on their own. I’m talking about society, the so-called man’s world of institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and power. If we want to live as women, some separatism is forced upon us: Mills College is a wise embodiment of that separatism. The war-games world wasn’t made by us or for us; we can’t even breathe the air there without masks. And if you put the mask on you’ll have a hard time getting it off. So how about going on doing things our own way, as to some extent you did here at Mills? Not for men and the male power hierarchy — that’s their game. Not against men, either — that’s still playing by their rules. But with any men who are with us: that’s our game. Why should a free woman with a college education either fight Machoman or serve him? Why should she live her life on his terms?

Machoman is afraid of our terms, which are not all rational, positive, competitive, etc. And so he has taught us to despise and deny them. In our society, women have lived, and have been despised for living, the whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for helplessness, weakness, and illness, for the irrational and the irreparable, for all that is obscure, passive, uncontrolled, animal, unclean — the valley of the shadow, the deep, the depths of life. All that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share it with us and therefore, like us, can’t play doctor, only nurse, can’t be warriors, only civilians, can’t be chiefs, only indians. Well so that is our country. The night side of our country. If there is a day side to it, high sierras, prairies of bright grass, we only know pioneers’ tales about it, we haven’t got there yet. We’re never going to get there by imitating Machoman. We are only going to get there by going our own way, by living there, by living through the night in our own country.

So what I hope for you is that you live there not as prisoners, ashamed of being women, consenting captives of a psychopathic social system, but as natives. That you will be at home there, keep house there, be your own mistress, with a room of your own. That you will do your work there, whatever you’re good at, art or science or tech or running a company or sweeping under the beds, and when they tell you that it’s second-class work because a woman is doing it, I hope you tell them to go to hell and while they’re going to give you equal pay for equal time. I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is. Our roots are in the dark; the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing — instead of around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls.



The ancient and honorable American custom of commencement speeches is an innocuous one that has done very little
harm to those who are graduating, and it may even have the beneficial consequence of teaching the graduates the virtue of patience. With the problems you are about to confront in the disturbed world of today, you will need patience. And the parents, who are now to be released from paying the high costs of keeping a student in college, are bound to be in such a happy mood that no speech could depress them.

I have no talent or inclination for framing cosmic remarks about the future, and I have never thought that even the most eloquent of speakers could make much out of "handing the torch" to those who have survived the rigors of a university education.

All of my training and experience, as a lawyer and as a judge, is to try to go to the heart of problems and to seek and frame solutions.

I discover, on reading about Pace University, that I am almost as old as the university itself and quite frankly I was astonished to find that you have an enrollment approaching 30,000 men and women. More important than either the age or the size of the university, is how it approaches its task. It is clear that Pace University is in the forefront of institutions that look to the future and to the enormous role that technology will play in our lives in the years ahead. In its systematic anticipation of the needs of the future, Pace University fulfills one of the great obligations of a university. I naturally have a particular affinity for night school graduates. And those who attended your day law school have a special benefit - they can always call on their more mature friends of the night section for help and advice and guidance!

Now to be serious -

Today I want to discuss with you a grave problem which my generation and those who went before me have failed to solve and as a result, you inherit the consequences of that failure. In one sense we can say that it is a "torch" you are being handed, one that will singe your pocketbooks and affect your lives from now on.

Since I have been a member of the federal judiciary I have thought and spoken on the subject of penal and correctional institutions and those policies and practices that ought to be changed. I see this as part of the administration of justice. People go to prisons only when judges send them there and judges should have a particular concern about the effectiveness of the prisons and the correctional process, even though we have no responsibility for their management. Based on my observations as a judge for more than twenty-five years and from visiting prisons in the United States and in most of the countries of Europe - and in the Soviet Union and The People's Republic of China - I have long believed that we have not gone about the matter in the best way.

This is one of the unresolved problems on your agenda and today I will propose some changes in our approach to prisons. But before doing that, let me suggest why the subject has a special relevance, even a special urgency, right now. Our country is about to embark on a multi-billion dollar prison construction program. At least one billion dollars of construction is already underway. The question I raise is this: are we going to build more "human warehouses" or should we change our thinking and create institutions that are training schools and factories with fences around them where we will first train the inmates and then have them engage in useful production to prepare them for the future and to help pay for their confinement? One thoughtful scholar of criminal justice described the state of affairs in much harsher terms than I have ever used.

Four years ago he wrote this:

Criminal justice in the United States is in a state of spreading decay. . . . The direct costs of crime include loss of life and limb, loss of [earnings],. . . physical and mental suffering by the victims and their families . .. .

These direct losses, he continued, run into many billions of dollars annually. But indirect losses are vastly more and reach the astonishing figure of 100 billion dollars a year. These indirect costs include higher police budgets, higher private security measures, higher insurance premiums, medical expenses of the victims, and welfare payments to dependents of prisoners and victims. In the immediate future these astounding figures and the great suffering that underlies them can be reduced. This can be done by more effective law enforcement which in turn will produce a demand for more and more prison facilities. But more prisons of the kind we now have will not solve the basic problem. Plainly, if we can divert more people from lives of crime we would benefit those who are diverted and the potential victims. All that we have done in improved law enforcement, in new laws for mandatory minimum sentences, and changes in parole and probation practices has not prevented thirty percent of America's homes from being touched by crime every year.

Twenty years ago I shared with such distinguished penologists as the late James V. Bennett, longtime Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Torsten Eriksson, his counterpart in Sweden, and Dr. George K. Sturrup in Denmark and others, high hopes for rehabilitation programs. These hopes now seem to have been based more on optimism and wishful thinking than on reality. During that period of time we have seen that even the enlightened correctional practices of Sweden and other northern European countries have produced results that, although better than ours, have also fallen short of expectations. On several occasions I have stated one proposition to which I have adhered to for the twenty-five years that I have worked on this problem and it is this:

When society places a person behind walls and bars it has an obligation - a moral obligation - to do whatever can reasonably be done to change that person before he or she goes back into the stream of society.

If we had begun twenty-five, thirty-five, or fifty years ago to develop the kinds of correctional programs that are appropriate for an enlightened and civilized society, the word "recidivist" might not have quite as much currency as it does today. This is not simply a matter of compassion for other human beings, it is a hard common sense matter for our own protection and our own pocketbooks.

In just the past ten years the prison population in America has doubled from less than 200,000 inmates to more than 400,000. This reflects, in part, the increase in crime, better law enforcement, and the imposition of longer sentences and more stringent standards of parole and probation. Budgets for law enforcement, for example, like the rates for theft insurance have skyrocketed.

If we accept the idea that the most fundamental obligation of government in a civilized society is the protection of people and homes, then we must have more effective law enforcement, but equally important, we must make fundamental changes in our prison and correctional systems. Just more stone, mortar and steel for walls and bars will not change this melancholy picture. If we are to make progress and at the same time protect the persons and property of people and make streets and homes safe from crime, we must change our approach in dealing with people convicted of crimes. Our system provides more protection and more safeguards for persons accused of crime, more appeals and more reviews than any other country in the world. But once the judicial process has run its course we seem to lose interest. The prisoner and the problem are brushed under the rug. It is predictable that a person confined in a penal institution for two, five or ten years, and then released, yet still unable to read, write, spell or do simple arithmetic and not trained in any marketable vocational skill, will be vulnerable to returning to a life of crime. And very often the return to crime begins within weeks after release. What job opportunities are there for an unskilled, functional illiterate who has a criminal record? The recidivists who return to our prisons are like automobiles that are called back to Detroit. What business enterprise, whether building automobiles in Detroit or ships in Norfolk, Virginia, or airplanes in Seattle, could continue with the same rate of "recall" of its "products" as our prisons?

The best prisons in the world, the best programs that we can devise will not totally cure this dismal problem for, like disease and war, it is one that the human race has struggled with since the beginning of organized societies. But improvements in our system can be made and the improvements will cost less in the long run than the failure to make them.

I have already said that today one billion dollars in new prison facilities is actually under construction. More than thirty states have authorized construction programs for new prison facilities that over the next ten years will cost as much as ten billion dollars.

If these programs proceed, and we must assume they will, it is imperative that there be new standards that will include the following:

(A) Conversion of prisons into places of education and training and into factories and shops for the production of goods.

(B) Repeal of statutes which limit the amount of prison industry production or the markets for such goods.

(C) Repeal of laws discriminating against the sale or transportation of prison-made goods.

(D) The leaders of business and organized labor must cooperate in programs to permit wider use of productive facilities in prisons.

On the affirmative side I have every reason to believe that business and labor leaders will cooperate in more intelligent and more humane prison programs. Of course, prison production programs will compete to some extent with the private sector, but this is not a real problem. With optimum progress in the programs I have outlined, it would be three to five years, or even more, before these changes would have any market impact and even then it will be a very small impact. I cannot believe for one moment that this great country of ours, the most voracious consumer society in the world, will not be able to absorb the production of prison inmates without significant injury to private employment or business. With the most favorable results, the production level of prison inmates would be no more than a tiny drop in the bucket in terms of the Gross National Product. Yet, we find prisons in the United States with limited production facilities which are lying idle because of statutory limitations confining the sale of their products to city and county governments within the state.

Amazingly enough, Congress recently dealt prison industry another blow in the form of a rider to the five percent gas tax, which prohibits the use of prison labor products in federally funded highway projects. This will damage state prison industries which were employing hundreds of prisoners in sign making, and may cost many millions of dollars in unsaleable inventory.

Happily this may be changed. The House of Representatives just passed a bill repealing the highway prohibition and increasing authorization for prison industry projects. It is now up to the Senate.

Prison inmates, by definition, are for the most part maladjusted people. From whatever cause, whether too little discipline or too much; too little security or too much; broken homes or whatever, these people lack self-esteem. They are insecure, they are at war with themselves as well as with society. They do not share the work ethic that made this country great. They did not learn, either at home or in the schools, the moral values that lead people to have respect and concern for the rights of others. But if we place that person in a factory, rather than a "warehouse," whether that factory makes ballpoint pens, hosiery, cases for watches, parts for automobiles, lawnmowers or computers; pay that person reasonable compensation, charge something for room and board, I believe we will have an improved chance to release from prison a person better able to secure gainful employment and to live a normal, productive life. If we do this, we will have a person whose self-esteem will at least have been improved so that there is a better chance that he or she can cope with life.

There are exceptions of course. The destructive arrogance of the psychopath with no concern for the rights of others may well be beyond the reach of any programs that prisons or treatments can provide. Our prison programs must aim chiefly at the others - those who want to change.

There is nothing really new in this concept. It has been applied for years in northern Europe, and in my native state of Minnesota there are important beginnings. Special federal legislation authorized pilot programs for contracts with private companies to produce and ship merchandise in interstate commerce. Even though Minnesota's pilot program involves only a fraction of the inmates it represents a significant new start. In that program prisoners were identified by tests to determine their adaptability for training. After that they were trained and now there are approximately fifty-two prisoners in one section of the Minnesota prison engaged in assembling computers for Control Data Corporation. These prisoners will have a job waiting for them when they leave prison. Is it not reasonable to assume that the temptation to return to a life of crime will be vastly reduced? On my first visit to Scandinavian prisons twenty-five years ago, I watched prison inmates constructing fishing dories, office furniture, and other products. On my most recent visit six years ago, prisoners in one institution were making components for prefabricated houses, under the supervision of skilled carpenters. Those components could be transported to a building site and assembled by semi-skilled workers under trained supervision. Two years ago in a prison I visited in The People's Republic of China, 1000 inmates made up a complete factory unit producing hosiery and casual sport shoes. Truly that was a factory with a fence around it. In each case, prisoners were learning a trade and paying at least part of the cost of their confinement.

Today the confinement of the 400,000 inmates in American prisons costs the taxpayers of this country, including the innocent victims of crimes, who help pay for it, more than twelve million dollars a day! I will let you convert that into billions. We need not try in one leap to copy fully the Scandinavian model of production in prison factories. We can begin with the production of machine parts for lawnmowers, automobiles, washing machines or refrigerators. This kind of limited beginning would minimize the capital investment for plant and equipment and give prisoners the opportunity to learn relatively simple skills at the outset.

We do not need the help of behavioral scientists to understand that human beings who are taught to produce useful goods for the marketplace, and to be productive are more likely to develop the self-esteem essential to a normal, integrated personality. This kind of program would provide training in skills and work habits, and replace the sense of hopelessness that is the common lot of prison inmates. Prisoners who work and study forty-five to fifty-five hours a week - as you graduates have done - are also less prone to violent prison conduct. Prisoners given a stake in society, and in the future, are more likely to avoid being part of the "recall" process that today sends thousands of repeat offenders back to prisons each year. One prison in Europe, an institution for incorrigible juvenile offenders from fourteen to eighteen years of age who had been convicted of serious crimes of violence, has on the wall at the entrance to the institution four challenging statements in bold script with letters a foot high. Translated they read approximately this way:

(1) You are here because you need help.

(2) We are here to help you.

(3) We cannot help you unless you cooperate.

(4) If you don't cooperate, we will make you.

Here is an offer of a compassionate helping hand coupled with the kind of discipline that, if missing in early life in homes and schools that ignored moral values, produces the kind of maladjusted, incorrigible people who are found in prisons. Some voices have been raised saying that prisoners should not be coerced into work and training programs. Depending upon what these speakers mean by "coerced," I might be able to agree. But I would say that every prisoner should be "induced" to cooperate by the same methods that are employed in many other areas. Life is filled with rewards for cooperation and penalties for noncooperation.

Prison sentences are shortened and privileges are given to prisoners who cooperate. What I urge are programs in which the inmate can earn and learn his way to freedom and the opportunity for a new life.

Opportunities for rewards and punishments permeate the lives of all free people and these opportunities should not be denied to prison inmates. At the core of the American private enterprise system is the idea that good performance is rewarded and poor performance is not. So I say we can induce inmates to cooperate in education and in production. A reasonable limit is that they should not be made to study more or work longer hours, for example, than students at Pace University must work to earn a degree! Surely it would not be rational to settle for less. I can hardly believe that anyone would seriously suggest that prisoners should be treated with less discipline than the young men and women in the colleges of America.

With as much as ten billion dollars of prison construction looming, we are at a crossroad, deciding what kind of prisons we are to have. As we brace ourselves for the tax collector's reaching into our pockets for these billions we have a choice: we can continue to have largely "human warehouses" with little or no educational, training or production programs or we can strike out on a new course with constructive, humanizing programs that will in the long run be less costly. The patterns are there in our federal prisons and in states like Minnesota.

It is your future. You make the choice.

President Lichman, members of the faculty, alumni, friends and graduates of the class of 1985. As I was sitting at the typewriter working on this commencement address, I thought to myself, "oh, no, not another contract!" Now that I have survived the ordeal, I am delighted to be with you here at my alma mater. I remember vividly my own commencement (many years ago)--sitting and listening to the commencement speaker, knowing with some trepidation, but with a lot of hope and some arrogance, that I would soon be on my own.

In trying to think of something funny to say about Sarah Lawrence, I realize that most humor comes from not liking something (I've got great jokes about high school). Unfortunately for the cause of humor, I loved my years at Sarah Lawrence. I was also VERY serious (almost a fanatic learner). I remember myself going to the music library carrying out stacks of records in the hope that by the end of my four years, I would have listened to everything. The music librarian was gentle and skeptical. I also remember, one weekend deciding that since I hadn't taken a course in art history, that I would give myself one by holing up in the library and reading all the art history books. This walking bundle of intensity called Meredith was definitely in need of some laughter, some balance and perspective. All these things and more were given to me by my don and teacher, Bessie Schonberg.

Bessie was and is a woman of the theater. I say that in the widest and fullest sense of the term. She knows and loves the breadth of the field, and for that reason she encouraged and allowed me to develop my different interests (music, dance, theater, film) without rigidly demanding that I specialize. What this gave me was the room to grow in a way that was right for me. It was at Sarah Lawrence that I got my first glimpse of what I would spend my life working on: a performance form that combines music, movement and drama into one mosaic of sight and sound with an underlying base of human emotion.

The first thing Bessie taught me was not to take myself so seriously--that everything that I came up with was not perfect by any means; it could be thrown away (and mostly should be thrown away) in order to start again. She also taught all of us to be respectful of each other--to appreciate each person's particular talents, styles, rates of growth for what they were. In other words, not to have a preconceived idea of what a body is, a dance is, a song is, a play is. This basic attitude (a kind of psychic anarchy) has given me the courage to try to find new ways of putting art forms together by working between the cracks; it has taught me to never assume anything; it has made the process of discovery one of the great joys of my life and it has kept me curious. Curiosity has a certain vitality to it because at first, it seems to lead to the possibility of chaos. Is there a new or different way of doing something? The prospect of trying something new often becomes so terrifying that we move back to more conventional solutions without realizing that chaos is the first step towards creativity. It's hard, but we have to tolerate moments of uncertainty and disorientation to get to new solutions. This initial confusion was always encouraged by Bessie. She knew that flowers and vegetables only come from a garden of dirt mixed with manure--that there is no good or bad in the initial stages of creativity, only material to work with.

Bessie was tough, she demanded a lot from her students, but more importantly, she taught us to be demanding of ourselves. I realized how essential and enduring this teaching was a few years ago, when I was asked to participate in a seminar on Performance with Bessie here at Sarah Lawrence on Alumnae Day. In a small room in the new and unfamiliar (to me) Reisinger Building, were former students from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's as well as current students. The discussion was lively and delicious--urgency and vitality permeated the room. The questions from the 30's alumnae were as intelligent and sensitive as the ones from the recent graduates and current students. I suddenly realized that I had not been a part of a discussion like this since my days at Sarah Lawrence--that the quality of attentiveness, involvement and insight of everyone in that room was something that I hadn't experienced in a long time. I became very impressed and homesick all at once. I was thrilled at how alive everyone in the room was--at how even women in their 60's and 70's had gone on growing and demanding the best for themselves. What I was homesick for, was the spirit of inquiry that is fostered at Sarah Lawrence, but is so difficult to find in the "civilian" world. Everyone is too busy trying to get by, to stop and wonder where it is going (and fast!). The wonderful and terrifying thing that a Sarah Lawrence education teaches is that you are in charge of yourself; that learning is a lifetime occupation, and that you have the right and duty to be what some people would call a "trouble maker"--that is, an independent, intelligent, curious person who wants to find his or her own solutions to things. This is not as easy as it sounds in a society where conformity and narrow-minded decision making are becoming more and more the norm--where the blunders and insensitivities of our so-called leaders are covered over and condoned, where instead of the world becoming a more intimate and tolerant place--(a place for exchange, communication, richness), the differences and conflicts between peoples, nations and cultures become more and more exacerbated.

I have felt this in my life very strongly in the last few years. In the late 60's and throughout the 70's, I was part of a great period of cultural exchange between American, European, Asian, African and Middle Eastern artists. I (as a soloist or with my company) would make at least one foreign tour a year. Many of the friendships that I made on those visits have remained a deep part of my life. We in America were also graced with performances from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Now, because of the strength of the dollar it is much more difficult to travel as an artist. It is prohibitive for Europeans, for example, to bring an American troupe--and nearly impossible for all but the most established European troupes to come here. To me, this is a metaphor for what has happened to the American vision--we strengthen in a narrow way without seeing the total picture. We think that we are stronger, but are actually weaker and more ignorant.

We don't need to accept this state of affairs and all the other increasingly imposed limitations of our society without a fight; we can insist upon a world of expansive vision and not blindness as an acceptable way of life. By that I don't mean increased real estate holdings or territorial expansion. I mean living with the consciousness of the hunger and suffering in the world and how we can help; living with the determination not to let this globe be destroyed by nuclear weapons and mistakes. We live in a world where ten pages of a magazine can be devoted to people whose most important aspirations are to possess a certain brand of cheese or the correct model of a car, who organize friendships the way they calculate investments. A world where to conform to what the media says the right way to live is, in some cases, the only way to survive--to keep a job for example or to find an apartment. The sad thing is that we confuse appreciation for the beauty of surfaces, enjoyment of life, with needing what we are told we need to live the "good" life.

We now live in a technocratic period. I see how this is manifest in the performing arts--it produces an emphasis on technique without the underlying values of communication, expression or just plain heart. What is lost is a sense of magic. At the time that I was doing my early work, many of us were engaged in trying to create a theater or performance place and time which would convey wonder. The wonder of picking up a cup. The wonder of white light going from dim to full. The wonder of the voice. The wonder of time going by. The wonder of laughter. Now, in a period and in a country where attention span is determined by the length of a television show--where most people frankly don't know whether they have received something that has nourished them or not--the only determining factor being whether the newspapers have endorsed it or not; it seems more important than ever to insist on the real thing. To know that we have the right to experience the magic of theater (either as a performer, creator, or member of the audience), that it is part of our human legacy. What I am saying about theater of course goes for literature, science, medicine, social studies etc. It is a matter of getting back to and fighting for human values.

What I hope for you the class of '85, is that you will figure out how to squeeze through. That you will figure out how to survive in such a society, but will also demand and create new ways of doing things that will affirm human life (and all living things). In a society that systematically limits feelings, I hope you will not be afraid to fight for them.

Graduates, Mr. President, faculty members, friends and families of the graduates who have done so much to make this possible. Today is the greatest day of my life. And, Mr. President, you certainly helped to make it that way. I appreciate it so much being able to come here and talk to our graduating class at The Ohio State University, the great, great University that you and I love.

I am so grateful and so appreciative to be here today, I just can't tell you how much.

I would like to start out with something that I use in almost every speech, and that is the idea of paying forward.

Paying forward - that is the thing that you folks with your great education from here can do for the rest of your lives. I was so happy the other day when I saw in the paper about Jim Lachey, who played here one year ago and comes back after one year of professional football to give a six-figure gift to the University. And what he said was, "I received a great education here and I got to play great football under Coach Bruce, and under a great football system here. I want to help some other youngster to do the same thing."

Take that attitude toward life, because so seldom can we pay back - those whom you owe - your parents and other people - will be gone. Emerson had something to say about that.

He said you can pay back only seldom. But you can always pay forward, and you must pay line for line, deed for deed, and cent for cent. He said beware of too much good accumulating in your palm or it will fast corrupt. That was Emerson's attitude and no one put it better than he did.

I might mention a couple of people. Jim Lachey is one who is already paying forward. Two weeks ago in Michigan, a former football player of ours passed away. He was in his 60s. He had been in the Marine Corps during World War II, on Okinawa - there were only 30 from his outfit that survived. That made a difference in him. He came back to coaching and he was a great coach. His name was Jack Castignola. He sent his son, Greg, here as one of our quarterbacks. Jack Castignota won nine championships - undefeated season, and all that - but he did something bigger: He coached 126 players who went on to college. One hundred and twenty-six players went on to college and that was his way of paying forward.

We had a great dean of agriculture here by the name of Roy Kottman, who retired a couple years ago. And on his retirement, he and I were having lunch one day in the Faculty Club, and I said, "Roy, how did you happen to go to Iowa State?" "Oh," he said, "I was working back during the Depression for $1.50 a day pumping gas and I couldn't save any money. But an old man in that community in Iowa came to me and said, 'Roy, if you'll go to Iowa State, I'll pay your tuition.' So I went to Iowa State and worked for my room and board, graduated, went into the service, came back, got my master's, my doctorate, went to West Virginia as dean of the agriculture college, and then I came to Ohio State." He was here 23 years, and in those 23 years, he virtually doubled food production in Ohio. On top of that, he graduated thousands of youngsters. On top of that, he helped to feed hungry mouths all over the world. All because that old man back in Iowa said, "Roy, if you'll go to Iowa State, I'll pay your tuition." That's paying forward.

You know, I might give you a little advice today - not too much, but a little bit. One thing you cannot afford ever to do is to feel sorry for yourself. You can't do it. You cannot feel sorry for yourself because that's what leads to drugs, what leads to alcohol, and those things that tear you apart.

In football, we always say, "That other team can't beat us. We have to make sure that we don't beat ourselves." And that is what a person has to do, too - make sure that they don't beat themselves. It takes an awful big man to beat you. So many times I've found people smarter than I was. I found them in football - bigger, they could run faster, could block harder, they were smarter people than I.

But you know what they couldn't do? They couldn't outwork me. They couldn't outwork me! And I ran into coaches that I coached against who had a much better background than I did, knew a lot more football than I did, but they couldn't work as long as I could. They couldn't stick in there as long as I could.

Of course my health was good. And I had a wonderful wife who put up with that - she'd allow me to stay and work. And I had great associations with my coaches. There was no one who had better people than I did, or better football players. And, we outworked the other teams. The only way we'd get beaten was if we got a little fatheaded, if we didn't train right, if we had dissension on the squad.

Family is so enormously important. I'm going to tell a story I shouldn't tell, but ...

I'm going to tell you about a student in your University right now. About a Rhodes Scholar, Mike Lanese. I asked his mother over a week ago, and I said, "When did you realize this young man was going to be outstanding?" She said, "When I was carrying him."

And she said, "When I'd tell people that, they'd laugh." They don't laugh now. I talked to his dad. I said, "When did you know he was going to be a great athlete?" "Well," he said, "by the time he was in the seventh grade, he was coming along physically. You could tell he was going to be a good one. But I found out something else when he was in the seventh grade - I found out he was listening to his coaching instruction and the instruction we gave him." There's your good family. For me, this goes all the way back to my grandmother and then right on down the line. She didn't tell my dad, "Now, you go to the study table." No, no. She said, "I'll meet you at the study table' " And that's where your good parents and good teachers are. They're talking now about all of this tutoring you need for athletes and all that. We were doing that 35 years ago. Because I didn't send those football players to the study table I met them at the study table.

When you deal with youngsters, when you get into jobs of any kind, don't send people to do it, meet them there and help them do it, and you'll be amazed how it works.

Don't forget the other thing I mentioned: You can outwork anybody. Try it, you will find out that you can do it.

You know in football, we do learn some wonderful things. And one of them is this. When you get knocked down - which is plenty often - you get right up in a hurry, just as quickly as you can. Then do you know what you do? You probably need more strength. You know where you get it? You get it in a huddle. You get it by going back and getting a new play and running that play together. "Together" is the thing that gives you the build-up to get ready to go again. And in your lifetime, how well you can work with people will depend on how quickly you get back to them and get together.

In football, you learn there's nothing that comes easy that's worth a dime. As a matter of fact, I never saw a football player make a tackle with a smile on his face.

Never.

We've had a great heritage. And so many times we've been so lucky you can't believe it. The odds against us were unbelievable.

It started with the Battle of Salamis, 500 years before the birth of Christ, in Greece. The Persians were there to conquer Greece and had burned Athens down. The Persians came in to whip them, but the Greeks had been getting ready for 10 years. They had discovered silver on Mt. Larium and they had taken that silver to help them make good ships - small ships that could maneuver. They mousetrapped those Persians into the Bay of Salamis, and then they attacked with the metal prows on their ships. They busted into them and the Persians couldn't get out of the way - they were too awkward in their big troop-carrying ships. And in one day, they sank the Persian fleet and drove it out of the gulf and all the way back to Persia. They drove them back, then the Greeks got busy. Do you know what they did? They went over and rebuilt their city and decided they needed a new type of government. They even had a name for it - "demos kratos." Did you ever hear of "demos kratos"? "People rule"! That was the beginning of democracy. Right there on the Bay of Salamis is where we got this great thing we have today.

A few years ago, the mayor of Stuttgart, West Germany, was here and I interviewed him on television. He was the son of the great general, Erwin Rommel.

I asked him, "Did your father agree with Hitter's order to stop on May 24, 1940, when he was within 40 miles of the English Channel?" He said, "Wait a minute, coach, there's something you're not thinking about. My father did not have choices at all. He lived in a dictatorship. I live in a democracy and you live in the greatest democracy in the world. You and everyone else in your country have choices and decisions to make almost every day of your lives. My father didn't." And that night when I got home, I started to wonder why he became so upset. I got to thinking, what was the last decision his father made on this earth? The decision was to take poison and die so that this boy and his mother could live. And that makes you appreciate democracy, when you look at it that way. And you do have great, great decisions to make every day of your life.

It all started with "demos kratos," when they drove those doggone Persians back to where they belonged.

This is much more recent, but we haven't heard too much about it. Another underdog victory. The fellows who did it were your age - the Battle of Britain. They were 4-to-I underdogs against Hitter's hordes. At that time, even the American ambassador to England was sending reports back here that he didn't think the British could win.

The British didn't look at it that way. They fought - men, women and the boys who flew those planes. And their mathematicians and scientists had done something that the German arrogance didn't think could happen. They had broken the German code - the Enigma Code - with their coding machine called the Ultra - and it was the "ultra." It was the best in the world. They knew where the German forces were coming from. They knew at what time they'd get there. They knew the point of attack, the formation, everything about them. Then these fighter planes of the British - manned mainly by British, but some Americans, some Polish, some Canadians - would go up and strike them just as they were ready to lower their bombs. The air marshal didn't send them out over the English Channel - he didn't have that many. He was outnumbered over 2-to-1. He didn't want to waste their fuel and their strength out there. The one thing these young fellows - just your age, mind you - wanted in the world, was to get up there and fight, and then get back and have a couple of hours to sleep under a shade tree to get ready to go up and fight again.

That's the way they fought and won. Then, when the British had won, General Dowding was criticized and fired. Well, there have been a lot of great men fired - MacArthur, Richard Nixon, a lot of them. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

But, rather than knighting the air marshal for what he had done - and he had fought an unbelievably great war - they sent him over here recruiting. He could have very easily straightened things out by telling about the Ultra secret, but he wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that because he knew that Ultra was going to be needed for the rest of the war. The secret wasn't told for 35 years after that. And this man went to his death keeping that secret. And that was Air Marshal Dowding - all honor to his great name, all honor. They won and they won for us, because if Hitler had whipped England then and got the English Navy - that was a year-and-a-half before we got into the war - we'd have never gotten into it and Hitler would have been here after that, you can believe that. That's how fortunate we were to have those great British people. And do you know what the greatest man in the war said about those fliers? He said, "Never has so much been owed by so many to so few." He was referring to those British flyers who won that Battle of Britain.

I'd like to tell you about one more battle, and it's referred to yet as a miracle - the Miracle at Midway. Underdogs? You can believe it. Well, let me tell you about it, quickly.

Underdogs? The Japanese had eight battleships in the area. We had eight, but all of ours were in the mud back at Pearl Harbor - this was six months after Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had 14 cruisers. We had five heavy cruisers. They had 45 destroyers, we had 15. They had a whole flotilla of submarines there. They had eight admirals in the area. We had two. And one of them was a substitute. Yet that substitute made two of the great decisions that were ever made in combat.

We had broken the Japanese code - the "purple code," the diplomatic code. We knew where they were coming - at least Admiral Nimitz at Pearl knew. He had a great man, a Commander Rochefort, who was his intelligence officer, who had spent three years in Japan before the war studying their language, and he broke their language code. He broke it and we knew they were coming to Midway. So the great advantage that Admiral Spruantz's substitute had was that he sent his planes off early because he knew the Japanese were going for another strike on Midway, and he hit their carriers when they had gasoline hoses all over the decks and land bombs were there, and everything else was on the decks. At 10:30, the Japanese were winning the war. By 10: 36, they had lost it. Three carriers - the Caga, the Akagi and the Soryu - were sunk in six minutes. They didn't go down until the next day, but they were mortally wounded. I talked to Ensign George Gay, who was in the water for 30 hours - his torpedo squadron, every plane went down; he's the only one who survived - and he said, "I had to hold my eye open to see the battle. My left eye was burned shut, but I held my right one open with my two hands and I watched the battle."

You know why they hit those ships? Teamwork, George Gay and Torpedo Squadron 789 went in there and were practically totally decimated - they never got a strike on those carriers. But do you know what they did? They brought down the air umbrella - the Japanese zeroes. And when they came down to hit them, our high-level bombers came over and in six minutes, that's what happened.

The thing that is so amazing about that is that those four ships that I mentioned (the three carriers plus the Hiryu) and two more - the Shokaku and the Shobo, which had been knocked out at Coral Sea, when the Japanese were trying to take Australia and we kept them from doing it - were the six that had raided Pearl Harbor six months before, before war was declared. It took us three more years in the Pacific. To win the war, Harry Truman had to use the atom bomb to save a million servicemen's lives and a million Japanese lives. You may have heard other opinions about that, but the truth is that he sat down with great men and he came to the conclusion that he had to use it to save our lives. I never voted for Harry Truman, but I fought for him and I think he was a wonderful, wonderful, great man.

But all of those things happened behind us. Our problems are before us. Russia, sure, is a problem. How did they get that way? Believe it or not, communism came right out of the First World War directly. The German general staff put Lenin into Russia to start that revolution. That's exactly the way it started. Now, half the world is enslaved by communism. The atom bomb is our other problem. It came out of Germany, too. It came out of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. A little Jewish lady brought that to us. We had it for two-and-one-half years and never started to build it until it looked like Hitter was going to win in '42. And that's when we started to build that atom bomb. But it is a problem in the world today.

These wars always bring bigger problems than they settle. We can't have that. And yet it's up to us to have such a good democracy that those people want it, too. Because right now, the communist expects one thing - you should know this. He expects to conquer the world. And they're tough people. They're just as tough as they can be, and yet we've got to live lives that are better than theirs. There are problems whenever you try to help them. If you give them food, they'll end up with a bigger army; if you give them technical devices they'll use them against us. The thing they want worst of all right now is what we know so well - computers. Oh, they would love to have our computers, but we can't let them have them. And we're going to have to work probably through another generation to get this settled, if it ever will be. But that's a job that will be in your future.

I'm going to tell you one little story about how education helps on this. Two years ago I was down speaking in Georgia, and one of my former football captains is there, and he brought his family for breakfast with me. He had a daughter that had been to a girls' school and the next year was going to go to the University of Georgia. And do you know what she was going to do? She's a pianist. She was going to work for two years and study Russian composers, then she was going to study the Russian language for two years. On top of that she was going to study TV communications so she could go to Russia. I think she'll be as fine an ambassador as we can have there, because she is a lovely young lady. Things like that, work like that, decisions like that, will help to change this and make it a better world.

And I have no idea, but you may have the attitude and the capacity and the ability to go on from here and help to make this a greater, greater world. And God speed, in the meantime, to all of you! Thank you very much.

Mr. President--at last I can say that with pleasure--and administrators of the university and all its schools--their family, friends and significant others--

Faculty with tenure. Faculty without tenure--

Parents and families of graduates. Step parents and chosen family of graduates--and anyone else who helped pay the bills.

Friends and lovers of graduates--(you know who you are).

Also students who someday will graduate, returning graduates, and people who just stopped by to watch because, like me, you are commencement junkies--

Staff members who house, feed and maintain all of the above, as well as preparing this ceremony.

And most of all, graduates, co-conspirators and subversives--Those who were born before June 1, 1965, and those born after--

Those who lived uphill, or downhill, or met in the Pagoda--

Fletcher graduates, who have the revolutionary idea that law might have a relationship to justice, and diplomacy to the truth--

Graduates who will build buildings that last longer than we do, or teeth that last as long as we do--a new event in human history--

Those who will cure illness, promote wellness, and save our environment, and who will extend a helping hand to the other living creatures on this Spaceship Earth--

In short, to everyone who shares this day as the celebration of one journey and the beginning of another, I say thank you for letting me share it with you. Because I confess that I am terminally sentimental about graduations. They are more individual than weddings. More conscious than christenings, or bar mitzvahs or bat mitzvahs. They are almost as much a step into the unknown as funerals--though I assure you, there is life after graduation.

In fact, ceremonies like these get to me every time.

And today is all the more momentous for the extraordinary group with whom I share honorary degrees. Please read about their work and lives and be as instructed as I have been.

As someone who tried (unsuccessfully) to dance her way out of Toledo, Ohio, and into the hearts of Americans, I have always wanted to meet Katherine Dunham. She brought dance out of its artsy ghetto, just as Natalie Davis had the revolutionary idea that ordinary people should be part of history--and vice versa.

I thank David McCord for being a rare man who loves both children and poetry. And I thank the spirit of the late Danny Kaye, who made us laugh with, never at, each other.

Dr. Callow has helped our bodies through his craft and our minds through his aid to this university.

Claude Shannon seems to me a kind of Zeus from whose forehead springs technology fullblown, communicative and user-friendly.

Winston Lord bridges worlds through diplomacy, just as C. S. Ioh combines art with commerce and business with conscience.

I thank Dr. Ames for managing to rescue both people from cancer and animals from pain.

It is an extraordinary group.

But I especially want to thank Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, who extended a U.S. Constitution written for, by and about white males to protect the reproductive freedom of women of all races. Because a fervent minority of Americans still disagree with women's rights and ability to make a conscientious decision about abortion, Justice Blackmun continues to live under hurtful attacks.

So I would like to publicly thank him on behalf of the more than 70 percent of Americans who agree with the decision he authored, who believe that a woman's life is also a human life, and who know that the majority decision he wrote may have saved the lives and health of more women in this country than any other single act in history.

One day soon, reproductive freedom--that is, the freedom to have or not have children, without government interference--will be recognized as a basic human right, like freedom of speech or assembly. Then, history will also thank Justice Blackmun.

But just in case the honor of this company and this occasion might endanger my humility, here is a note of reality: I don't remember one single thing my own commencement speaker said. I was consumed with concern about how my friends would get on with my family, and vice versa; about how I was going to pack four years of possessions into one car; and about how I was not going to get married to the very tempting man I was then engaged to--(In the '50s, everybody got married or engaged before or right after graduation--but I wanted to go off to India instead).

Furthermore, I conducted a small survey in preparation for today. Half of my sample couldn't remember who their commencement speaker was.

So instead of pursuing one theme that might exclude many people, I'm going to be diverse in the hope of leaving a sentence or two that might be useful to more people. All these thoughts come under the general heading of "what I know now that I wish I'd known then." One other organizing principle I will leave to the end--and I defy you to guess what it is. I've also tried to follow Henny Youngman's wisdom--he always told one-liners because longer jokes weren't, as he put it, "worth the trip"--by keeping each thought short.

For instance:

Thought 1: A person who has experienced something is almost always far more expert on it than are the experts. A corollary is that any process including only experts, with no contribution from those with personal experience, will probably go wrong. An extension is that our educational system is long on book learning, but short on apprenticeship. A further extension is that our social policy is long on theorists, and short on organizers.

A national example: The poverty programs of the Johnson Administration were less successful than the Depression projects of the Roosevelt Administration in part because the first were mostly designed by Washington poverticians, while the second were mostly local initiatives that were given government support.

For a personal example: I wish someone had warned me that book learning, as valuable and irreplaceable as it may be, can also make you self-critical, reverential and otherwise fearful of acting. (Of course, this is especially true if you are female, or a different race or ethnicity, and nobody in the books looks like you--but I hope you have had more inclusive textbooks than I did).

So whatever you want to do, just do it. Don't worry about making a damn fool of yourself. Making a damn fool of yourself is absolutely essential. And you will have a great time.

Thought 2: When I was a student, we used to sit around discussing whether a particular end justified a particular means. On the assumption of everyone from Marx or Machiavelli, I thought that was the question.

It took me twenty years to figure out that the means are the ends--and vice versa. Whatever means you use become an organic part of the ends you achieve.

For example: Groups rarely benefit from revolutions if they haven't been an organic part of that revolution. Even if they are given certain paper rights at the end of the process, they may remain too weak to use them. Strength comes from process. Process is all.

Thought 3: If you have to choose character or intelligence--in a friend or in a candidate--choose character. Intelligence without character is dangerous, but character without intelligence only slows down a good result.

Thought 4: Politics is not just what goes on in the electoral system, or in Washington. Politics is any power relationship in our daily lives. Anytime one human being is habitually powerful over another, or one group over another, not because of talent or experience, but just because of race, or sex or class, that's politics. So when we look at the fields of your state and mind, and see that one color of human beings owns them, and another color works on them as migrant labor, that's politics. When we find a hundred of one kind of human being in the typing pool, and a few of another in the boardroom, that's politics. When children have only their father's name, that's politics. When most men have only one job, while most women have two--one inside the home and one outside it--that's politics, too. And when students of color are still in smaller proportion than are people of color in the population, or women are a lesser percentage of dentists and engineers, or men a lesser proportion of physical therapists and nutritionists, that's politics.

Forget old definitions. They were based on the idea that what happened to men was politics, and what happened to women was culture. That division was just a way of keeping certain parts of life immune to change. In fact, the personal is very often political. And revolutions, like houses, get built from the bottom up, not the top down.

Thought 5: As Margaret Mead once said, "Marriage worked well in the 19th Century because people only lived to be fifty."

Because life expectancy has increased about thirty years since 1900, there are bound to be different ways of living. Some people will marry and raise children young, then go off amicably for another life of a different accomplishment. Some will marry late--after their work lives are well under way--and have children later or not at all. Some will not marry, or will love and live with a partner of the same gender. Others will raise their children among a chosen family of friends, or find colleagues in work and shared ideals who are their spiritual family.

As the prison of form diminishes, we can pay more attention to content. That means equal power between partners and thus the possibility of free choice. That means commitment out of decision, not desperation or pressure. That means kindness, empathy and nurturing--because those of us who are not parents can help those who are. We can have children as friends.

If that sounds Pollyanna-ish, consider that the foreshadowings of such a change are with us now. Women in the paid workforce--and hopefully men who are real parents, too--are finally beginning to bring the reality of children's lives into the public sphere. This is long overdue: The United States is the only industrialized democracy in the world that behaves as if children didn't exist until the age of six.

Furthermore, the divorce rate has begun to decline, an event that feminists have always predicted. When people used to say to me, "Feminism is the cause of divorce," I always said, "No, marriage is the cause of divorce." Forcing all people to believe they had to live one way was the cause of many bad marriages, just as forcing all people to believe they had to be parents was the cause of many bad parents and unhappy children. No one way of living can be right for all people.

So the message is: Don't worry if your life doesn't look like a Dick-and-Jane primer. Don't worry if it doesn't look like the Yuppie opposite of a Dick-and-Jane primer. The point is less what we choose, than that we have the power to make a choice.

Thought 6: Remember the '50s and '60s? Then, women were supposed to marry what we wanted to become--as in, "Marry a doctor, don't be one." In the '70s and '80s, some women started to say, "We are becoming the men we wanted to marry." But in the '90s, more men must become the women they wanted to marry.

I'll know we're getting someplace when as many young men as young women ask, "How can I combine career and family?"

And men will be getting someplace, too. They won't be strangers to their children anymore. They won't be suppressing qualities in themselves that are human but not stereotypically masculine. They will even be living longer, since the pressures of having to win, or even be aggressive or violent, all lead to the clear conclusion that the prison of the so-called masculine role is the killer of many men.

This isn't a role exchange--it's a humanization of both roles. For both women and men, progress probably lies in the direction we haven't been. For women, it may lie in becoming more active in public life. For men, it may lie in playing a real part of private life. But for both, the pleasure and reward is becoming a whole human being.

I wish I had realized this earlier. It means progress is not always a straight line, in which we must defeat or outstrip others and there is only one winner. Progress is a circle in which we strive to use all our talents and complete ourselves. Potentially, we are all winners.

Thought 7: Don't forget to give at least ten percent of everything you earn to social change. It's the best investment you'll ever make. Possessions can be lost, broken or begin to possess you. Indeed, if you're really happy in your life and work, you won't have that much time to shop and buy and re-buy and repair anyway. The money you save may not be worth that much tomorrow. Insurance companies may cancel your policies. Tithing is the pioneer example and the religious example. Helping others is the only way to be sure there will be someone there to help you.

Finally, the last thought and an organizing principle of this list of I-wish-I-had-knowns: the reason why acting on such thoughts is timely and vital right now.

Economists are warning, and politicians are fearing, that this nation is at the end of its economic expansionist period. There are now other countries that can compete or even outstrip us in productivity. For the first time, 80 percent of Americans have not increased their real buying power in the last ten years, and many young people will not do as well in conventional economic terms as their parents.

Most authorities see this as a time of danger--and that is true. Energies deflected from earning more and buying more could cause us to fly apart politically.

But this is also an opportunity to make real changes in our lives and in our country.

It is time for America to become known for the quality of life as well as the quantity of goods.

It is time to carry out the greatest mission and legacy of our culture: that we are the world's biggest experiment in multi-cultural and multi-racial living. Our fragile planet needs to learn exactly this lesson of cherishing each other's differences. This campus is imperfect, but it is far better than the world outside it, and the world could be much more like it--with politicians as open to visitors as are the deans in the hall I face; women heading newspapers and governments as they do here, and commitment to mutual support and non-violence.

Bigger is not better. America's military might is not our best legacy.

Equality is the best insurance against the political upheaval that authorities fear. More than 70 percent of Americans say they are willing to change their standard of living in conventional economic terms--providing this so-called "sacrifice" is evenly spread.

This is a turning point in history--and your challenge. Our hearts go with you. Our heads and hands are here to help you. The brotherhood of man and the sisterhood of women--the humanity of people--is "not so wild a dream as those who profit by delaying it would have us believe."

One more point. This is the last period of time that will seem lengthy to you at only 3 or 4 years. From now on, time will pass without artificial academic measure. It will go by like the wind.

Whatever you want to do, do it now. For life is time, and time is all there is.

President Oakley, trustees, faculty, friends and most especially members of the graduating class. One always says it, but this time it is true: I am honored to be here. Williams is one of the few truly great colleges in this country, known consistently over the years for both its academic excellence and its civility.

To those of us who were once young and spent some time here, it is, of course, also known for other things. These I will not dwell on except to say that from my years as an undergraduate at Smith, I still retain many happy memories of utterly dissolute weekends at Williams. In my wildest imaginings at the time I could not have supposed that one day, doddering and infirm, I would be standing up here with the forces of law and order.

I want to talk to you today about journalism, not just because it is pretty much the only thing I know, but also because what journalists try to do is really little more than what everyone tries to do, one way and another, in daily life.You might not judge this to be the case from the turbulence that attends much of our activity and the self-dramatizing way in which we sometimes describe our calling. But it is true. What we do for a living is merely what you are going to have to do every day of your life: try to figure out what is going on and how to think about it. So the process is worth a few minutes of your thought.

The first thing to be said about that process, of course, at least as it is carried out by working journalists, is that nobody, or practically nobody, is ever pleased with the result. Nobody ever has been. There have been trouble making pundits in our midst, after all, since the days of the Hebrew prophets and Greek seers, folks who really know how to rain on a politician’s parade. Agamemnon spoke for more than himself I think and more than he knew - including perhaps a whole succession of American presidents - when he said to the seer Kalkhas, the first syndicated columnist, as I see it:

“You visionary of hell, never have I had fair play in your forecasts. Calamity is all you care about, or see, no happy portents, and you bring to pass nothing agreeable.”

Or, as it is regularly put these days: Why don’t you people ever report the good news?

But, importantly, it is not just politicians and other objects of journalistic attention who are inclined to resist discomfiting news. It is just as often the general public too, and again, always has been. No one in history summed up the sentiment more concisely than the 19th century bishop’s wife, whose words, upon learning of Charles Darwin’s thesis that all humankind was descended from apes, speak to the ages:

“Let us hope it is not true, and if it is, let us pray it does not become generally known.”

Let me quickly say that I am not endorsing here the idea, beloved of some in our business, that the very resentment we stir must be proof of both our accuracy and our virtue. On the contrary, it demonstrates neither. The amount of hostility and discomfort we generate, is no more reliable an index of the quality of our reporting and analysis than is the presence of the sunnier, chirpier view of things, the view so devoutly preferred by Agamemnon, the bishop’s wife and whatever rogue politician or preacher we may be scrutinizing that day.

It is lazy, defective journalism and, by extension, lazy defective thinking on the reader’s part, to assume otherwise. Saying things are terrible does not automatically establish the reliability of your account.

You need to understand this not just if your are going to be a good professional journalist, but equally if you are going to be an intelligent lay journalist in life; you need to understand it if you are going to be able to read your newspaper critically or react reasonably to the Babel of high-powered analysis that comes your way so relentlessly these days.

Consider the moment - June of 1987. It is, according to the fashionable consensus, the most immoral of times. And included in the impressionistic evidence that this is so, I am sorry to say, is a recurrent, blanket condemnation of the class of ‘87, culminating in the preposterous assertion that there is just no intellectual energy or even public service heartbeat to be found in your generation, nothing but a lust for possessions.

Obviously there are some who fit the description. But anyone who knows more than a handful of people of your age, and anyone, I may add, who has read into the literature of Williams College as I have recently done and followed the tremendous individual volunteer efforts going on, will know that this is not true. Yet somehow, despite the evidence, the crazy all-devouring generalization lives on.

How can you yourself protect against interpreting the world around you in a similarly fatuous way? Precisely by avoiding the pitfalls of bad journalism and bad general analysis that lead to it. I will identify just a couple of these. They are habits of mind which have not only helped to create the present overwrought sense of universal moral collapse, but also, ironically, worked to keep us from seeing what may be truly distinctive and repugnant in the age. Two stand out.

First, if, God willing, you have studied some history while you were here, you will have helped guard against the most empty-headed of these: the disposition to suppose that everything is happening for the first time – that every human foible and ethical lapse you see is not just the first, but also the worst. This is uneducated and ahistorical. In the great preacher wars and revelations now going on, for instance, some of us may be meeting Jim and Tammy Baker for the first time. But history isn’t. They and many of the other principals in the drama are well known. Will Rogers and H. L. Mencken knew them. So did Mark Twain. So did Edward Gibbon and Geoffrey Chaucer and Lucretius, all of whom had plenty to say about what they regarded as religious flummery.

And so, in a curious fashion, did Harriet Beecher Stowe, not because she was a satirist or a skeptic like the others, but because her younger brother, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, was the central figure in an absolutely volcanic church-sex scandal in the 1870’s, a news event, by the way, that historians tell us generated more press coverage and comment than anything had since the civil war.

I don’t mean to suggest that we as a society or as individuals should become complacent about serious wrongdoing. What I mean to suggest is that only when you have some feeling for our unremittingly accident-prone past as a species are you able to put present conduct in some perspective. Only then are you able to see, as Chaucer did, say, what is familiar and funny and poignant about the Wife of Bath, as distinct from trying to book her on a felony.

History helps guard against moral smugness too, or it should, anyway. For you are obliged, if you are honest, to acknowledge at least some reflection or resonance of the fallen ones in your own nature. Such humility is a conspicuously missing aspect of our contemporary culture, however. What might be a becoming spell of moral introspection, tends instead to become an orgy of bashing and blaming. I observe that now, as always in this country, when people speak of a terrible, all embracing decline in ethical standards, they are invariably speaking of the decline in their next door neighbor’s standards, not their own.

Such are the ultimate wages of ignoring human history, which is to say, ignoring who we are. But look out: for the flip side of this failure has some dangers of its own. I am thinking of those analysts who know a little history but misuse it. These are the half-baked determinists, fatalists and dead-enders of our society who, knowing that there are historical precedents for certain broad categories of current behavior, cite this fact as proof that there is not further purpose in thinking about the present at all. They create a kind of quasi-historical rationale for the dismissive, “everybody does it” argument. I mean, “Hell, Agamemnon did it, what’s the big deal about Nixon?”

This tendency also comes in a cyclical variation. It is worth pondering here that while the day, the month and the year all exist in nature and were there all along for us to discern, the week is essentially a human invention. There are no Wednesdays in nature. It was we who created life as a vista of endlessly recurring Wednesdays - Wednesdays without end. This being one of the fundamental human methods of bringing order, or at least an illusion of order, out of chaos.

Just so, there is much temptation in journalism to yield to a kind of convenient here-it-comes-again, Ferris wheel principle of organizing and interpreting experience. It is thanks to this custom, of course, that your much-maligned generation is seen as an all-points-perfect recreation of my own much-maligned generation, one full turn of the Ferris wheel.

Do not be tempted by the cycle trap. It results in blurring exactly those distinctions you should be looking for. I can show you, for example, an article I wrote more than 25 years ago about a then current wallow in talk of an American moral collapse; the great moral collapse of the late 1950s. It was about three great moral collapses ago, but it was a doozy. Just as now, it had money-mad athletes, crooked businessmen, worldly churchmen, corrupt professionals, a middle-class that loved its household goods too well, lying, cheating, and all around abysmal behavior. All this was ceaselessly talked about and condemned, and some of it was even true.

But what we are observing today is in key respects different from all that. Such a past is worth study as an aid to discovering those differences and thus understanding our own condition better, but not as quest for reassurance that we may be no better than most, but are no worse, either.

This, in large measure, is what respectable - and, yes, honorable - journalism requires. First finding out, and then working as fairly and unflaggingly as you can to isolate and understand the precedents, the relationships and the distinctiveness, the individually, of the figures and events in the landscape you are putting before your readers.

I could tell you a dozen ways in which the public leaders currently in hot water are different from those who were in hot water about a quarter of a century ago, and an equal number of ways in which the moral atmosphere is different - in some but not all of them insidiously worse. I could also show you a dozen ways in which, based on my own observation, this generation of young people is doing good, not just doing well, in ways that bespeak an intelligence and generosity of spirit that their predecessors, including those of the much romanticized sixties, ought to envy. But it is the discipline for discerning these things, not the endless example, that concerns me here.

And now having pronounced you all honorary journalists, let me offer one final guiding phrase for your career. Some years back the critic John Malcolm Brinnin wrote a book about Dylan Thomas which embodied a faithful but very particular perception of the poet, one that stressed his sad, last, drunken, coming apart days in New York. It was an affront to Thomas’s widow and she engaged in heated exchange with the critic. I have always remembered her phrasing because I found it so arresting and right, and I always commend it to would-be journalists. Caitlin Thomas did not say that Brinnin had told lies, or that what he had reported had not occurred. She did not say he was in any narrow or measurable sense “wrong,” because he was not. She said, and this is the phrase: I know a better truth than Brinnin’s.

As the dispute over Dylan Thomas’s life and his last days still goes on, and as his widow herself I fear has made her own contribution to the confusion, it would be foolish to assume that her “better truth” is the right one. But the phrase, the conception is the right one for us.

A better truth, not necessarily a more positive or friendly or comfortable one, or even a contradictory truth, but one that is larger, roomier, more complex and more authentic than any one-shot version can be. That is what journalism, yours and mine, ideally will be about. Keep the faith. Do the profession proud. We need all the help we can get.

It's a particular honor for me to be here at this wonderful college where my mother taught on the faculty about 40 years ago. And it's a special, special honor to be here to pay tribute to Oakes and Louise as their time of stewardship of this college comes to an end. I was here as a trustee when they came and the affection that I have for them and their affection which they have shown for everything in this place makes me particularly proud to be here today.

I would like to talk to you today a little bit but not so much to give a speech as to tell you a few stories. Tell you a few stories about choices. When I was growing up, I wondered about whether I would have the courage to make the kind of choice my father made. My father became early an extremely active anti-fascist and as a result of his being an active anti-fascist, he had to leave Italy and we had to come here and start all over again. But the decision to abandon a comfortable life for the life of an activist, of a revolutionary, which is what he was, though of the most mild of revolutionaries from the most traditional of backgrounds, always puzzled me. I wondered how this person had done it and one day I asked him about it. And he said to me, "Everyone speaks about the banality of people and very few people speak about the banality of good. How did I become an active anti-fascist? To be an anti-fascist is relatively easy. What they were doing was wrong but how did I become an activist?

It happened when I was in school, in medical school. The fascists had kicked out the president of the university and replaced him with someone else who was a perfectly decent person but more pliant. And all of us as students went to hear the inauguration of the new president, the one who was to be more pliant. And the president who had been just appointed stood up and made a speech, which was a perfectly decent speech, and so we applauded. And the minister of education, the fascist minister of education who had made the change, got up and made a perfectly terrible speech about how everybody was going to march and do exactly what they
were told. And, he said, "In the middle of the speech, he paused at a point for applause and everybody applauded and a couple of friends of mine didn't applaud because there was nothing to applaud. How could one applaud that?" He said, "We didn't hiss, we didn't boo, we were much too well brought up to do anything like that. We just didn't applaud. And some people behind us said you'd better applaud, they're taking your name down." He sighed and said, "I was 21 years old, if I had known that going and not applauding would get me into trouble, maybe I would have stayed home. But I was there and I hadn't applauded before and now I was told I had to applaud and I was 21 years old, no I couldn't applaud. And neither could a couple of my friends. When the ceremony was over, we were picked up and they beat the tar out of us. At that point, we didn't want to go home bloody because it would scare our parents. And so we went. I said, "Where did you go?" He said, "Right in the square, right there, right by the university." I said, "That was a main square, wasn't it?" "I don't know, he said, "that wasn't in our minds. There was a fountain there; we wanted to walk." So they did. It was taken as a provocation that they were washing to show that they had been beaten up so they got beaten up again and tossed into jail. He said, "After that the decision was made. I was not going to be a quiet anti-fascist. I was stamped for life, that was it." A non-choice then but yet an important one that changed his life. 

The second choice that I want to tell you about or the second story is considerably more dramatic. It involves, as all these stories will, people I know. It involved a cousin of my father's who in the middle of the war went into hiding because he was Jewish and the Nazis had come in and he needed to hide. And he went into hiding in a villa which belonged to his wife's family, an old, old Catholic family, and they took assumed names so that they would not be recognized.

They went there with their children, their oldest at the time 4 years old, and they all had assumed names. Sometime after, the villa was taken over to billet German soldiers and the captain in charge of these soldiers was a perfectly dreadful person. He tried to steal things. He abused my father's cousin because he thought he was a draft dodger and that's why he was there. He behaved in every way appallingly, so appallingly that some evenings he would get drunk and try to break into the door of the room where his wife's sister slept to rape her and only the coming of
other people would stop him. A dreadful man in every way - or so it seemed. One day, my cousin’s son was playing by the villa and the German captain called him by the assumed name and the child forgot and didn't answer. The German captain called him again and the child still didn't answer and the German captain went right up to him and said, "That isn't your name, is it"? And the little boy was frightened and said no. And the captain said, "That isn't your name because you're Jewish and you're having an assumed name" and the little boy said yes and ran off into the house to tell his parents what had happened. And a dreadful, dreadful silence took over as they waited because they could not escape and assumed they would be taken away. But slowly, they realized that nothing was going to happen. Indeed, the only thing that happened was that the German captain started being somewhat nicer to my cousin because he realized that he was there not as a draft dodger, but for other reasons.  So somehow this dreadful man made a choice, a decision that he was not going to turn these people in. A decision which was made at the risk of his own life because if any of his soldiers had heard what he said, had heard the conversation with the boy as was very likely to be the case, and turned him in, he was dead. That choice didn't change the man, he continued to get drunk, he continued to steal, he continued to try to break the door down and yet it was a decision, a choice which was made that was an
extraordinary one.

My third story also concerns someone in Italy, and also at the risk of someone's life. It concerns a farmer on some of our lands in Italy whom I went to see after the war. He had had the reputation that during the war he had hidden at the risk of his life allied servicemen who had been caught behind German lines and were escaping. Jews who were escaping from the Nazis.

All the people on the right side of that conflict who were in trouble. But he had also the reputation that the moment things changed in 1944-1945, he hid the Germans who were running away. Now it wasn't at the risk of his life but when they came through, he hid them as well. And I went to see him because I was very young and I thought that this was terrible; that this was someone who did not understand the difference between right and wrong, that he couldn't distinguish between hiding people who deserved to be hidden and hiding criminals. I already sounded like a lawyer, I guess. And when I went to see him, I asked him and he said, "Politics, politics, I don't know anything about that. I don't know anything about those things. I don't care about them. When they came here, when they were running away, each one of them was in trouble. “Erun tutti e figli di mamma” -- They were each the child of some mother somewhere“Tiriammo a campare -- We all struggled to live." And I wondered about that. It is very hard for a lawyer because you have to do justice and yet there was something, and he wasn't doing that. 

There was something about that humanity, that decision to look after the individual who was in trouble and to care about the person living before him which represented something in that culture which explained why relatively so few people were taken away during the Nazi time. Because an awful lot of people didn't worry about law, didn't worry about politics, didn't worry about rules which told them to take people away but just looked at the individual in need, the mothers' and fathers' son before them.

My last story deals with some famous people, the only one that deals with some famous people, but also one of whom I knew. A few weeks ago, a man named Fred Korematsu came to speak at Yale Law School. Fred Korematsu is an old man, who as a young man born in the United States, Japanese-American, refused to go to the concentration camps that were set up for people with Japanese-American extraction on the West Coast during the Second World War. And he was jailed and he fought the case all the way through to the Supreme Court and he lost. That program, one of the disgraces of our history, which has now many years later been held by the courts to be a disgrace, was upheld. But the person who wrote the opinion upholding that program was Hugo Black, Justice Black, the person for whom I clerked in the Supreme Court. A person whom many of you know as a great hero, a great civil libertarian, a person who has been on the right side on almost all the causes. And when I clerked, I asked him about that and he said, "Oh well, it was war and the military said that it was necessary, and there were all sorts of reasons why this was important and all my clerks tell me I was wrong but you don't really understand what was going on." Then he added, "And besides, you know the other people who were in favor of that were Earl Warren, by then Chief Justice, the time before that I think as Attorney General of California, supported the program and another bureau in many ways and Franklin Roosevelt supported the program totally." So here were dreadful choices, dreadful choices made by very good people. Non-choice by good person, dramatic choice by an evil person, wonderful and troublesome choice by a person who didn't think it was a choice at all and an evil choice by people who are good.

What can I tell you about these stories? Not much, not much. In one sense, I would much rather let them speak for themselves. I cannot, for instance, tell you what made some choose well and some not, what instinct carried the day. I can tell you that the decision not to applaud, like the farmer's decision to hide people, were much more choices than they may have seemed to the doers themselves. I know my father, knew my father, well enough to know that that was the case. I saw him lead me into some equivalent good non-choices, as when he led me to go to the march on Washington in 1963. In that very much the same way for me it was a non-choice, he led me.

So that these choices, these non-choices were not totally non-choices. I can tell you that abiding by the law, by good manners, would have been of very little guidance in any of these situations.

Good manners would have said applaud, the law would have said turn them all in. The law was what, in fact, Justice Black, Earl Warren, and Franklin Roosevelt were following. I don't mean that the law is always on the wrong side. I'm Italian, but not that Italian. But it doesn't always help. I can tell you that the fact that there is a good argument on the other side can be devastatingly harmful. There were plenty of good arguments made for the Coramazzo case and they were all wrong. And in any case, the fact that there is a good argument on either side doesn't avoid the ultimate responsibility for a person facing those choices, as a farmer well knew. I can also tell you that sometimes little choices make politically correct reasons, what other people are doing makes tremendous differences to the chooser’s life, as in my father's case. In other times, great choices make almost no difference to the chooser's life. The German continued to be in other ways a dreadful person. Black and Warren and Roosevelt continued in other ways to be extraordinary and quite wonderful people despite the choices that they made. 

There are many changes I could ring on these stories, but I guess I would like to leave you with just one thought. In one of these stories, a bad person made a dramatically good choice and we should remember that, both when we see someone we think of as bad, or equally so, when we think of ourselves that way. We should remember that capacity when we do not think of ourselves as good, or when we see others as bad, that capacity in a situation unexpectedly to do something which is profoundly right even if profoundly dangerous. It is always there. But more important, some extraordinarily good people made a catastrophically bad decision and it is on this that I would focus. It is not that we are wrong in viewing Black and Warren and Roosevelt as good. The temptation is immediately to say, if they did that, there must have been something else wrong with them. They must have been in some ways bad.

No, I don't think so. If we do that, we're shirking. We're saying it's other people who do that. Rather, I think it is that all of us, I and you, are as subject to being careless, uncaring. We will all thoughtlessly, I and you, applaud at times we shouldn't. Or even dramatically at times like Black and the others, mislead ourselves into following what seemed like good reasons, reasons, for a dreadful decision. Not one of these dreadful decisions which we will make will change us necessarily into bad people. And yet in time, these choices will define us. If my father emphasized the simplicity of good, I would like to leave you with the ease, the simplicity of making mistakes. Not to dishearten you; far from it. But in the hope that it will put you on your guard. But it is not always or even often the bad person who does evil and in the hope that it will make you more understanding of those who do wrong, because they can be, they are, you and me.

And finally, to remind you that these choices which reoccur do make a difference, if not always or often, to the world. They will always make a difference to the children of some mothers and fathers around us as we all struggle to live. Thank you.

Life is a game with many rules but no referee. One learns how to play it more by watching it than by consulting any book, including the Holy Book. Small wonder, then, that so many play dirty, that so few win, that so many lose.

I am not totally oblivious to the pressures the so-called modern world exerts upon the young, I feel nostalgic for those who sat in your chairs a dozen or so years ago, because some of them at least could cite the Ten Commandments and still others even remembered the names of the Seven Deadly Sins. As to what they’ve done with that precious knowledge of theirs afterward, as to how they fared in the game, I have no idea. All I can hope for is that in the long run one is better off being guided by rules and taboos laid down by someone totally impalpable than by the penal code alone.

Since your run is most likely to be fairly long, and since being better off and having a decent world around you is what you presumably are after, you could do worse than to acquaint yourselves with those commandments and that list of sins. … But I am not here to extol the virtues of any particular creed or philosophy, nor do I relish, as so many seem to, the opportunity to snipe at the modern system of education or at you, its alleged victims. To begin with, I don’t perceive you as such. After all, in certain fields your knowledge is immeasurably superior to mine or anyone’s of my generation. I regard you as a bunch of young, reasonably egotistical souls on the eve of a very long journey. I shudder to contemplate its length, and I ask myself in what way I could possibly be of use to you. Do I know something about life that could be of help or consequence to you, and if I do, is there a way to pass this information on to you?

The answer to the first question is, I suppose, yes — not so much because a person of my age is entitled to out-fox any of you at existential chess as because he is, in all probability, tired of quite a lot of the stuff you are still aspiring to. (This fatigue alone is something the young should be advised on as an attendant feature of both their eventual success and their failure; this sort of knowledge may enhance their savoring of the former as well as a better weathering of the latter.) As for the second question, I truly wonder. The example of the aforementioned commandments may discourage any commencement speaker, for the Ten Commandments themselves were a commencement address — literally so, I must say. But there is a transparent wall between the generations, an ironic curtain, if you will, a see-through veil allowing almost no passage of experience. At best, some tips.

Now and in the time to be, I think it will pay for you to zero in on being precise with your language. Try to build and treat your vocabulary the way you are to treat your checking account. Pay every attention to it and try to increase your earnings. The purpose here is not to boost your bedroom eloquence or your professional success — although those, too, can be consequences — nor is it to turn you into parlor sophisticates. The purpose is to enable you to articulate yourselves as fully and precisely as possible; in a word, the purpose is your balance. For the accumulation of things not spelled out, not properly articulated, may result in neurosis. On a daily basis, a lot is happening to one’s psyche; the mode of one’s expression, however, often remains the same. Articulation lags behind experience. That doesn’t go well with the psyche. Sentiments, nuances, thoughts, perceptions that remain nameless, unable to be voiced and dissatisfied with approximations, get pent up within an individual and may lead to a psychological explosion or implosion. To avoid that, one needn’t turn into a bookworm. One should simply acquire a dictionary and read it on the same daily basis — and, on and off, with books of poetry. 

Dictionaries, however, are of primary importance. There are a lot of them around; some of them even come with a magnifying glass. They are reasonably cheap, but even the most expensive among them (those equipped with a magnifying glass) cost far less than a single visit to a psychiatrist. If you are going to visit one nevertheless, go with the symptoms of a dictionary junkie.

Now and in the time to be, try to be kind to your parents. If this sounds too close to “Honor thy mother and father” for your comfort, so be it. All I am trying to say is try not to rebel against them, for, in all likelihood, they will die before you do, so you can spare yourselves at least this source of guilt if not of grief. If you must rebel, rebel against those who are not so easily hurt. Parents are too close a target (so, by the way, are sisters, brothers, wives or husbands); the range is such that you can’t miss. Rebellion against one’s parents, for all its I-won’t-take-a-single-penny-from-you, is essentially an extremely bourgeois sort of thing, because it provides the rebel with the ultimate in comfort, in this case, mental comfort: the comfort of one’s convictions. The later you hit this pattern, the later you become a mental bourgeois, i.e., the longer you stay skeptical, doubtful, intellectually uncomfortable, the better it is for you.

On the other hand, of course, this not-a-single-penny business makes practical sense, because your parents, in all likelihood, will bequeath all they’ve got to you, and the successful rebel will end up with the entire fortune intact — in other words, rebellion is a very efficient form of savings. The interest, though, is crippling; I’d say, bankrupting.

Try not to set too much store by politicians — not so much because they are dumb or dishonest, which is more often than not the case, but because of the size of their job, which is too big even for the best among them, by this or that political party, doctrine, system or a blueprint thereof. All they or those can do, at best, is to diminish a social evil, not eradicate it. No matter how substantial an improvement may be, ethically speaking it will always be negligible, because there will always be those — say, just one person — who won’t profit from this improvement. The world is not perfect; the Golden Age never was or will be. The only thing that’s going to happen to the world is that it will get bigger, i.e., more populated while not growing in size. No matter how fairly the man you’ve elected will promise to cut the pie, it won’t grow in size; as a matter of fact, the portions are bound to get smaller. In light of that, or, rather, in dark of that — you ought to rely on your own home cooking, that is, on managing the world yourselves — at least that part of it that lies within your reach, within your radius. Yet in doing this, you must also prepare yourselves for the heart-rending realization that even that pie of yours won’t suffice; you must prepare yourselves that you’re likely to dine as much in disappointment as in gratitude. The most difficult lesson to learn here is to be steady in the kitchen, since by serving this pie just once you create quite a lot of expectations. Ask yourself whether you can afford a steady supply of those pies, or would you rather bargain on a politician? Whatever the outcome of this soul-searching may be — however much you think the world can bet on your baking — you might start right away by insisting that those corporations, banks, schools, labs and whatnot where you’ll be working, and whose premises are heated and policed round the clock anyway, permit the homeless in for the night, now that it’s winter.

Try not to stand out, try to be modest. There are too many of us as it is, and there are going to be many more, very soon. Thus climbing into the limelight is bound to be one at the expense of the others who won’t be climbing. That you must step on somebody’s toes doesn’t mean you should stand on their shoulders. Besides, all you will see from that vantage point is the human sea, plus those who, like you, have assumed a similarly conspicuous — and precarious at that — position: those who are called rich and famous. On the whole, there is always something faintly unpalatable about being better off than one’s likes, and when those likes come in billions, it is more so. To this it should be added that the rich and famous these days, too, come in throngs, that up there on the top it’s very crowded. So if you want to get rich or famous or both, by all means go ahead, but don’t make a meal of it. To covet what somebody else has is to forfeit your uniqueness; on the other hand, of course, it stimulates mass production. But as you are running through life only once, it is only sensible to try to avoid the most obvious cliches, limited editions included. The notion of exclusivity, mind you, also forfeits your uniqueness, not to mention that it shrinks your sense of reality to the already-achieved. Far better than belonging to any club is to be jostled by the multitudes of those who, given their income and their appearance, represent — at least theoretically — unlimited potential. Try to be more like them than like those who are not like them; try to wear gray. Mimicry is the defense of individuality, not its surrender. I would advise you to lower your voice, too, but I am afraid you will think I am going too far. Still, keep in mind that there is always somebody next to you, a neighbor. Nobody asks you to love him, but try not to hurt or discomfort him much; try to tread on his toes carefully; and should you come to covet his wife, remember at least that this testifies to the failure of your imagination, to your disbelief in — or ignorance of — reality’s unlimited potential. Worse comes to worst, try to remember how far away — from the stars, from the depths of the universe, perhaps from its opposite end — came this request not to do it, as well as this idea of loving your neighbor no less than yourself. Maybe the stars know more about gravity, as well as about loneliness, than you do; coveting eyes that they are.

At all costs try to avoid granting yourself the status of the victim. Of all the parts of your body, be most vigilant over your index finger, for it is blame-thirsty. A pointed finger is a victim’s logo — the opposite of the V-sign and a synonym for surrender. No matter how abominable your condition may be, try not to blame anything or anybody: history, the state, superiors, race, parents, the phase of the moon, childhood, toilet training, etc. The menu is vast and tedious, and this vastness and tedium alone should be offensive enough to set one’s intelligence against choosing from it. The moment that you place blame somewhere, you undermine your resolve to change anything; it could be argued even that that blame-thirsty finger oscillates as wildly as it does because the resolve was never great enough in the first place. After all, a victim status is not without its sweetness. It commands compassion, confers distinction, and whole nations and continents bask in the murk of mental discounts advertised as the victim’s conscience. There is an entire victim-culture, ranging from private counselors to international loans. The professed goal of this network notwithstanding, its net result is that of lowering one’s expectations from the threshold, so that a measly advantage could be perceived or billed as a major breakthrough. Of course, this is therapeutic and, given the scarcity of the world’s resources, perhaps even hygienic, so for want of a better identity, one may embrace it — but try to resist it. However abundant and irrefutable is the evidence that you are on the losing side, negate it as long as you have your wits about you, as long as your lips can utter “No.” On the whole, try to respect life not only for its amenities but for its hardships, too. They are a part of the game, and what’s good about a hardship is that it is not a deception. Whenever you are in trouble, in some scrape, on the verge of despair or in despair, remember: that’s life speaking to you in the only language it knows well. In other words, try to be a little masochistic: without a touch of masochism, the meaning of life is not complete. If this is of any help, try to remember that human dignity is an absolute, not a piecemeal notion, that it is inconsistent with special pleading, that it derives its poise from denying the obvious. Should you find this argument a bit on the heady side, think at least that by considering yourself a victim you but enlarge the vacuum of irresponsibility that demons or demagogues love so much to fill, since a paralyzed will is no dainty for angels.

The world you are about to enter and exist in doesn’t have a good reputation. It’s been better geographically than historically; it’s still far more attractive visually than socially. It’s not a nice place, as you are soon to find out, and I rather doubt that it will get much nicer by the time you leave it. Still, it’s the only world available; no alternative exists, and if one did, there is no guarantee that it would be much better than this one. It is a jungle out there, as well as a desert, a slippery slope, a swamp, etc. — literally — but, what’s worse, metaphorically, too. Yet, as Robert Frost has said, “The best way out is always through.” He also said, in a different poem, though, that “to be social is to be forgiving.” It’s with a few remarks about this business of getting through that I would like to close.
Try not to pay attention to those who will try to make life miserable for you. There will be a lot of those — in the official capacity as well as the self-appointed. Suffer them if you can’t escape them, but once you have steered clear of them, give them the shortest shrift possible. Above all, try to avoid telling stories about the unjust treatment you received at their hands; avoid it no matter how receptive your audience may be. Tales of this sort extend the existence of your antagonists; most likely they are counting on your being talkative and relating your experience to others. By himself, no individual is worth an exercise in injustice (or for that matter, in justice). The ratio of one-to-one doesn’t justify the effort: it’s the echo that counts. That’s the main principle of any oppressor, whether state-sponsored or autodidact. Therefore, steal, or still, the echo, so that you don’t allow an event, however unpleasant or momentous, to claim any more time than it took for it to occur.

What your foes do derives its significance or consequence from the way you react. Therefore, rush through or past them as though they were yellow and not red lights. Don’t linger on them mentally or verbally; don’t pride yourself on forgiving or forgetting them — worse come to worse, do the forgetting first. This way you’ll spare your brain cells a lot of useless agitation; this way, perhaps, you may even save those pigheads from themselves, since the prospect of being forgotten is shorter than that of being forgiven. So flip the channel: you can’t put this network out of circulation, but at least you can reduce its ratings. Now, this solution is not likely to please angels, but, then again, it’s bound to hurt demons, and for the moment that’s all that really matters.

I can’t divine your future, but it’s pretty obvious to any naked eye that you have a lot going for you. To say the least, you were born, which is in itself half the battle, and you live in a democracy — this halfway house between nightmare and utopia — which throws fewer obstacles in the way of an individual than its alternatives.

President Gaudiani, Dean Johnson, Dean Hampton, distinguished faculty, members of the class of 1989 and ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here today especially since it is not raining. I had wanted to see everybody's handsome and beautiful faces and I hope that you are all using the right products. That is the only commercial.

As the chaplain said, we are here to share in the excitement of completing and of starting and I want to share with you a sense of some of the commencements. The startings, that I have gone through.

In April of 1939, the New York World's Fair opened in New York City. My father and I went to see the world of tomorrow and there were miraculous things there. There was a plywood house that was on one floor called a ranch-style house. No one had ever seen anything like this. There was a split-level house. We saw something called television and a freezer that was attached to a refrigerator. These were things that were said to be happening tomorrow. Those days had finite beginnings and finite ends, but those times have changed. There are no longer beginnings or ends like the beginning of the summer on July 4 or the end of the summer on Labor Day. We are living today in the middle of beginnings. 

Sean O'Casey said, "Each age is an age that is dying and one that is born anew each day." Tomorrow is here today, tomorrow has already arrived. It is here all around us sprouting up like plants in the springtime. There is a vitality and an enthusiasm today that is remarkable and I want to share with you some of the ideas that I see of things that are happening to help you see your way, because fully 95 percent of you sitting here today will have a difference career than what you are intending to do five years from now.

If we can get through the rain, let me talk to you about some of the trends that I see. The first is the return of traditional values. The forties and fifties, with their simplicity, are coming back. Proms are back, linoleum in the kitchen is back, weddings, beauty parlors, men's white shirts, (and the women who are wearing them). Mom food is back: meat loaf and mashed potatoes are the future. Marriage is back. So is a reverence for children. These new/old traditions are leading us to safer, sounder values.

So what are these safer values? You have heard the word cocooning. A need to protect ourselves from a harsh unpredictable world leads us to search for a safer, familiar environment. You have all heard of couch potatoes? Well, they are the ultimate cocooners. You know that pet ownership is soaring. Fish are the pet of the nineties. And the home. Last year Americans spent $12.5 billion just on china, glassware and tableware for their homes. They spent over $17.5 billion on gardening alone. Over half the gardeners today are people in the age range 35 to 49.

The kitchen is again becoming the center of the home. Forty-nine percent of all Americans eat their dinner in the kitchen. We are moving into an era of small indulgences in an atmosphere of stress. People want to indulge in affordable luxuries and seek ways to be kind to themselves. They say "I deserve it." Chocolate sales are up. Stuffed bears were the hottest thing for two Christmases in a row. Shorter vacations, one week mini-vacations, in a spa or on a cruise. We are looking for scaled-down symbols of our success. Fancy bicycles have replaced fancy cars and the ultimate replacement for alcohol, smoking and even sex is the Dove Bar. These are small indulgences.

The next thing that has happened is a word that you have heard: cashing out. It is okay to be unsure of yourself and to move an easier simpler, more secure environment. I have had employees who have moved away from New York or Boston to an easier life in Vermont or Ohio. More people are moving to the country or smaller towns. In 1978 there were 2,000 bed and breakfast inns. In 1988 there were 12,000. More MBA's are rejecting Wall Street for entrepreneurial adventures. They are more concerned with their family, with health and with ethics than money and power. Ben and Jerry had replaced Lee Iacocca as our new folk heros.

A word to the parents. It is okay for your sons and daughters to take time off. Don't give them a hard time because they need that breathing space. You forget that when you graduated there was always something that you had to do like the military.

Another trend is the return of mother. The country is adopting what used to be thought of as feminine values: ethics, passion and compassion. In spite of the change in the tax laws, individual donations to charities and institutions like Connecticut College are up dramatically. Individuals are far more generous; corporations aren't.

Twenty-three million Americans volunteer five or more hours per week now to charity and community service and this gives rise to a new word I want to share with you: that word is fivers, people who give five percent of their income and five hours a week to community service. That is what you can do.

Better education is another new direction. There is a 50 percent increase in applications to colleges that are teaching education. Columbia University's applications are up over 50 percent. With the globalization of business, foreign languages are growing in importance. The new Connecticut College Center for International Studies and Liberal Arts here has attracted nationwide attention. One of the things I want to urge you to do is please, if you have the time, beg, borrow, steal the money, go abroad, learn a language in the next year. The language that you learn this year will be with you forever and it is something you will never forget. Take the time now. And I want you to think of another word and that is to give back. Members of the class of 1989, 75 percent of your education was paid for by your tuition, but 25 percent was paid for by people who never met you, through direct contributions to your endowment. They did not know who you were but gave generously so you could have your education. There is going to be a time when you can afford to give some of that back and you are going to be expected to give back a little bit to people that you have never met and never known. Give back to Connecticut College so that the future generations can have the education that you had.

For the final trend: we are living in an age where fantasy is on a wave of popularity. The modern age whets our desire for risk-taking. We watch Indiana Jones or visit the new fantasy hotels in Hawaii or have fun watching a little girl make it big in the movie Working Girl. We all have our fantasies. I had mine. As a kid I wasn't very rich but when I went into the cosmetics business I wanted to make it very big. We were a tiny company, but I dreamed someday of being able to run a large company. I went one day to visit one of my customers and told her that I wanted our company to be the largest of them all. She looked at me and said "you think that you can be the largest - hah!" I dreamed of doing it and finally I achieved it and that is when I came to realize that fantasizing, projecting yourself into a successful situation is the most powerful means there is of achieving personal goals. That is what an athlete does when he kicks a field goal with three second on the clock, and 80,000 people in the stands and 30 million people watching. As the kicker begins to move he automatically makes the thousand tiny adjustments necessary to achieve the mental picture he has formed in his mind so many times: the picture of himself kicking the winning field goal. The ability to project is a common trait among great athletes. They have future vision, they see things happening a split second before they happen. 

There is a man named Viktor E. Frankl who owes his life to his ability to project himself. I heard him speak once at a meeting. He was a renowned Viennese psychologist before the Nazis threw him into a concentration camp. When he spoke he held me spellbound. "Look," he said, "there is only one reason why I am here today. What kept me alive in a situation where others had given up hope and died was the dream that someday I would be here telling you how I survived the Nazi concentration camp. I have never been here before. I have never seen any of you before and I have never given this speech, before but in my dreams I have stood before you in this room and said these words a thousand times." Anatole France said, "To accomplish great things we must dream as well as act." I can only say that it was 35 years ago that I sat in your seat and listened to a steady procession of commencement speakers who spoke to me of the brave new world. I am honored that you chose me to be your commencement speaker. It has been my dream come true. Men and women of the Class of 1989 I salute you. I am honored that you invited me to be here.

Thank you.

Thank you very, very much, President Keohane. Mrs. Gorbachev, Trustees, faculty, parents, and I should say, Julia Porter, class president, and certainly my new best friend, Christine Bicknell -- and, of course, the Class of 1990. I am really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as I know all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us.

These -- These are exciting times. They're exciting in Washington, and I have really looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was going to be fun. I never dreamt it would be this much fun. So, thank you for that.

More than ten years ago, when I was invited here to talk about our experiences in the People's Republic of China, I was struck by both the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place.

Wellesley, you see, is not just a place but an idea -- an experiment in excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced. The essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech about tolerance given last year by a student body president of one of your sister colleges. She related the story by Robert Fulghum about a young pastor, finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits upon the game called "Giants, Wizards, and Dwarfs." "You have to decide now," the pastor instructed the children, "which you are -- a giant, a wizard, or a dwarf?" At that, a small girl tugging at his pants leg, asked, "But where do the mermaids stand?" And the pastor tells her there are no mermaids. And she says, "Oh yes there are -- they are. I am a mermaid."

Now this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about to give up on either her identity, or the game. She intended to take her place wherever mermaids fit into the scheme of things. "Where do the mermaids stand? All of those who are different, those who do not fit the boxes and the pigeonholes?" "Answer that question," wrote Fulghum, "And you can build a school, a nation, or a whole world." As that very wise young woman said, "Diversity, like anything worth having, requires effort -- effort to learn about and respect difference, to be compassionate with one another, to cherish our own identity, and to accept unconditionally the same in others.

You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit. Now I know your first choice today was Alice Walker -- guess how I know! -- known for The Color Purple. Instead you got me -- known for the color of my hair. Alice Walker's book has a special resonance here. At Wellesley, each class is known by a special color. For four years the Class of '90 has worn the color purple. Today you meet on Severance Green to say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search for your own true colors.

In the world that awaits you, beyond the shores of Waban -- Lake Waban, no one can say what your true colors will be. But this I do know: You have a first class education from a first class school. And so you need not, probably cannot, live a "paint-by-numbers" life. Decisions are not irrevocable. Choices do come back. And as you set off from Wellesley, I hope that many of you will consider making three very special choices.

The first is to believe in something larger than yourself, to get involved in some of the big ideas of our time. I chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society.

And early on I made another choice, which I hope you'll make as well. Whether you are talking about education, career, or service, you're talking about life -- and life really must have joy. It's supposed to be fun.

One of the reasons I made the most important decision of my life, to marry George Bush, is because he made me laugh. It's true, sometimes we've laughed through our tears, but that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds. Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, "Life moves pretty fast; and you don't stop and look around once in a while, you're going to miss it."

(I'm not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than you clapped for George.)

The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human connections: your relationships with family and friends. For several years, you've had impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work. And, of course, that's true. But as important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, a business leader will be, you are a human being first. And those human connections --- with spouses, with children, with friends -- are the most important investments you will ever make.

At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent.

We are in a transitional period right now -- We are in a transitional period right now, fascinating and exhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we, men and women, are facing. As an example, I remember what a friend said, on hearing her husband complain to his buddies that he had to babysit. Quickly setting him straight, my friend told her husband that when it's your own kids, it's not called babysitting.

Now maybe we should adjust faster; maybe we should adjust slower. But whatever the era twenty -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children. Your success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White House, but on what happens inside your house.

For over fifty years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley's annual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say, the winner will be the first to become a C.E.O. Both -- Both of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those who want to know where the mermaids stand. So -- So I want to offer a new legend: the winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream -- not society's dreams  -- her own personal dream.

And who -- Who knows? Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as the President's spouse -- and I wish him well.

Well, the controversy ends here. But our conversation is only beginning. And a worthwhile conversation it has been. So as you leave Wellesley today, take with you deep thanks for the courtesy and the honor you have shared with Mrs. Gorbachev and with me.

Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of your dreams.

I have a recurring dream about Kenyon. In it, I'm walking to the post office on the way to my first class at the start of the school year. Suddenly it occurs to me that I don't have my schedule memorized, and I'm not sure which classes I'm taking, or where exactly I'm supposed to be going.

As I walk up the steps to the postoffice, I realize I don't have my box key, and in fact, I can't remember what my box number is. I'm certain that everyone I know has written me a letter, but I can't get them. I get more flustered and annoyed by the minute. I head back to Middle Path, racking my brains and asking myself, "How many more years until I graduate? ...Wait, didn't I graduate already?? How old AM I?" Then I wake up.

Experience is food for the brain. And four years at Kenyon is a rich meal. I suppose it should be no surprise that your brains will probably burp up Kenyon for a long time. And I think the reason I keep having the dream is because its central image is a metaphor for a good part of life: that is, not knowing where you're going or what you're doing. I graduated exactly ten years ago. That doesn't give me a great deal of experience to speak from, but I'm emboldened by the fact that I can't remember a bit of MY commencement, and I trust that in half an hour, you won't remember of yours either. In the middle of my sophomore year at Kenyon, I decided to paint a copy of Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of my dorm room. By standing on a chair, I could reach the ceiling, and I taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy the picture from my art history book.

Working with your arm over your head is hard work, so a few of my more ingenious friends rigged up a scaffold for me by stacking two chairs on my bed, and laying the table from the hall lounge across the chairs and over to the top of my closet. By climbing up onto my bed and up the chairs, I could hoist myself onto the table, and lie in relative comfort two feet under my painting. My roommate would then hand up my paints, and I could work for several hours at a stretch.

The picture took me months to do, and in fact, I didn't finish the work until very near the end of the school year. I wasn't much of a painter then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it gained in the incongruity of having a High Renaissance masterpiece in a college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older laundry.

The painting lent an air of cosmic grandeur to my room, and it seemed to put life into a larger perspective. Those boring, flowery English poets didn't seem quite so important, when right above my head God was transmitting the spark of life to man.My friends and I liked the finished painting so much in fact, that we decided I should ask permission to do it. As you might expect, the housing director was curious to know why I wanted to paint this elaborate picture on my ceiling a few weeks before school let out. Well, you don't get to be a sophomore at Kenyon without learning how to fabricate ideas you never had, but I guess it was obvious that my idea was being proposed retroactively. It ended up that I was allowed to paint the picture, so long as I painted over it and returned the ceiling to normal at the end of the year. And that's what I did.

Despite the futility of the whole episode, my fondest memories of college are times like these, where things were done out of some inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was demanded. Clearly, I never spent as much time or work on any authorized art project, or any poli sci paper, as I spent on this one act of vandalism.

It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves. And with all due respect to John Stuart Mill, maybe utilitarianism is overrated. If I've learned one thing from being a cartoonist, it's how important playing is to creativity and happiness. My job is essentially to come up with 365 ideas a year.

If you ever want to find out just how uninteresting you really are, get a job where the quality and frequency of your thoughts determine your livelihood. I've found that the only way I can keep writing every day, year after year, is to let my mind wander into new territories. To do that, I've had to cultivate a kind of mental playfulness.

We're not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running.

You may be surprised to find how quickly daily routine and the demands of "just getting by: absorb your waking hours. You may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your politics and religion become matters of habit rather than thought and inquiry. You may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your life in terms of other people's expectations rather than issues. You may be surprised to find out how quickly reading a good book sounds like a luxury.

At school, new ideas are thrust at you every day. Out in the world, you'll have to find the inner motivation to search for new ideas on your own. With any luck at all, you'll never need to take an idea and squeeze a punchline out of it, but as bright, creative people, you'll be called upon to generate ideas and solutions all your lives. Letting your mind play is the best way to solve problems.

For me, it's been liberating to put myself in the mind of a fictitious six year-old each day, and rediscover my own curiosity. I've been amazed at how one ideas leads to others if I allow my mind to play and wander. I know a lot about dinosaurs now, and the information has helped me out of quite a few deadlines.A playful mind is inquisitive, and learning is fun. If you indulge your natural curiosity and retain a sense of fun in new experience, I think you'll find it functions as a sort of shock absorber for the bumpy road ahead.

So, what's it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but beyond that, I don't recommend it.

I don't look back on my first few years out of school with much affection, and if I could have talked to you six months ago, I'd have encouraged you all to flunk some classes and postpone this moment as long as possible. But now it's too late.

Unfortunately, that was all the advice I really had. When I was sitting where you are, I was one of the lucky few who had a cushy job waiting for me. I'd drawn political cartoons for the Collegian for four years, and the Cincinnati Post had hired me as an editorial cartoonist. All my friends were either dreading the infamous first year of law school, or despondent about their chances of convincing anyone that a history degree had any real application outside of academia.

Boy, was I smug.

As it turned out, my editor instantly regretted his decision to hire me. By the end of the summer, I'd been given notice; by the beginning of winter, I was in an unemployment line; and by the end of my first year away from Kenyon, I was broke and living with my parents again. You can imagine how upset my dad was when he learned that Kenyon doesn't give refunds.

Watching my career explode on the lauchpad caused some soul searching. I eventually admitted that I didn't have what it takes to be a good political cartoonist, that is, an interest in politics, and I returned to my firs love, comic strips.For years I got nothing but rejection letters, and I was forced to accept a real job.

A REAL job is a job you hate. I designed car ads and grocery ads in the windowless basement of a convenience store, and I hated every single minute of the 4-1/2 million minutes I worked there. My fellow prisoners at work were basically concerned about how to punch the time clock at the perfect second where they would earn another 20 cents without doing any work for it.

It was incredible: after every break, the entire staff would stand around in the garage where the time clock was, and wait for that last click. And after my used car needed the head gasket replaced twice, I waited in the garage too.

It's funny how at Kenyon, you take for granted that the people around you think about more than the last episode of Dynasty. I guess that's what it means to be in an ivory tower.

Anyway, after a few months at this job, I was starved for some life of the mind that, during my lunch break, I used to read those poli sci books that I'd somehow never quite finished when I was here. Some of those books were actually kind of interesting. It was a rude shock to see just how empty and robotic life can be when you don't care about what you're doing, and the only reason you're there is to pay the bills. Thoreau said,

"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

That's one of those dumb cocktail quotations that will strike fear in your heart as you get older. Actually, I was leading a life of loud desperation.

When it seemed I would be writing about "Midnite Madness Sale-abrations" for the rest of my life, a friend used to console me that cream always rises to the top. I used to think, so do people who throw themselves into the sea.

I tell you all this because it's worth recognizing that there is no such thing as an overnight success. You will do well to cultivate the resources in yourself that bring you happiness outside of success or failure. The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. At that time, we turn around and say, yes, this is obviously where I was going all along. It's a good idea to try to enjoy the scenery on the detours, because you'll probably take a few.

I still haven't drawn the strip as long as it took me to get the job. To endure five years of rejection to get a job requires either a faith in oneself that borders on delusion, or a love of the work. I loved the work.

Drawing comic strips for five years without pay drove home the point that the fun of cartooning wasn't in the money; it was in the work. This turned out to be an important realization when my break finally came.

Like many people, I found that what I was chasing wasn't what I caught. I've wanted to be a cartoonist since I was old enough to read cartoons, and I never really thought about cartoons as being a business. It never occurred to me that a comic strip I created would be at the mercy of a bloodsucking corporate parasite called a syndicate, and that I'd be faced with countless ethical decisions masquerading as simple business decisions.

To make a business decision, you don't need much philosophy; all you need is greed, and maybe a little knowledge of how the game works.

As my comic strip became popular, the pressure to capitalize on that popularity increased to the point where I was spending almost as much time screaming at executives as drawing. Cartoon merchandising is a $12 billion dollar a year industry and the syndicate understandably wanted a piece of that pie. But the more I though about what they wanted to do with my creation, the more inconsistent it seemed with the reasons I draw cartoons.

Selling out is usually more a matter of buying in. Sell out, and you're really buying into someone else's system of values, rules and rewards.The so-called "opportunity" I faced would have meant giving up my individual voice for that of a money-grubbing corporation. It would have meant my purpose in writing was to sell things, not say things. My pride in craft would be sacrificed to the efficiency of mass production and the work of assistants. Authorship would become committee decision. Creativity would become work for pay. Art would turn into commerce. In short, money was supposed to supply all the meaning I'd need.What the syndicate wanted to do, in other words, was turn my comic strip into everything calculated, empty and robotic that I hated about my old job. They would turn my characters into television hucksters and T-shirt sloganeers and deprive me of characters that actually expressed my own thoughts.

On those terms, I found the offer easy to refuse. Unfortunately, the syndicate also found my refusal easy to refuse, and we've been fighting for over three years now. Such is American business, I guess, where the desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience.

You will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both personal and professional. We all have different desires and needs, but if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.Many of you will be going on to law school, business school, medical school, or other graduate work, and you can expect the kind of starting salary that, with luck, will allow you to pay off your own tuition debts within your own lifetime.

But having an enviable career is one thing, and being a happy person is another.

Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.

You'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you'll hear about them.

To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.

Reading those turgid philosophers here in these remote stone buildings may not get you a job, but if those books have forced you to ask yourself questions about what makes life truthful, purposeful, meaningful, and redeeming, you have the Swiss Army Knife of mental tools, and it's going to come in handy all the time.

I think you'll find that Kenyon touched a deep part of you. These have been formative years. Chances are, at least of your roommates has taught you everything ugly about human nature you ever wanted to know.

With luck, you've also had a class that transmitted a spark of insight or interest you'd never had before. Cultivate that interest, and you may find a deeper meaning in your life that feeds your soul and spirit. Your preparation for the real world is not in the answers you've learned, but in the questions you've learned how to ask yourself.Graduating from Kenyon, I suspect you'll find yourselves quite well prepared indeed.

I wish you all fulfillment and happiness. Congratulations on your achievement.

It is a very special pleasure for me to be here at Wellesley College today, a pleasure that goes back to my childhood.

I was born on the island of Manhattan and grew up in New York, a solitary, only child, with parents almost old enough to be my grandparents, with full lives of their own, so when I wasn't in school I had a lot of time to myself. When I was in fourth grade I was put into a school which is still in existence, so it will be nameless, which was supposed to be one of the best schools in the city. In that school it was very important that one be good at sports. One of my legs was longer than the other -- still is, so I was clumsy and not a good runner. Any team which had the misfortune to have me on its side automatically lost. The kids would choose sides and the unlucky team to get me would let out anguished groans, and I can't blame them. I was hardly an asset to team sports. However, for some reason which is still not clear to me, my home room teacher decided that since I couldn't run relay races, I wasn't very bright. She simply accepted the other students' assessment of me, and I couldn't do anything right. I quickly learned that there was no point in doing homework for her, because she was going to hold it up in ridicule to the class, or put it down. So I would go home and dump down my school books and not look at them again, say wryly to myself that I was the dumb one, the unpopular one, and then I would move into the real world, where I read stories, wrote stories, and tried in my own way to find out what human relationships were all about.

It was also in fourth grade that I learned about the perfidy of the adult world, and the earlier this is learned the better; it can come as a terrible shock if it doesn't hit you till later. I learned it in French class, which was being taught by a very large French woman. I needed to be excused, and I raised my hand, and my French teacher wouldn't let me leave the room. Three times I raised my hand, each time a little more desperately than the time before, and three times she refused to let me go. When the bell rang for it I ran, and I didn't make it. Now, to wet your pants in fourth grade is really pretty horrendous. My mother came for me, and here was this little wet mess. I told her what had happened, and she went to the principal. The principal called in the French teacher, and the French teacher said, "Well, Madeleine never asked to be excused. of course if she'd raised her hand I'd have let her go. She's just ashamed of wetting her pants, a big girl like that. Tell her not to lie about it next time". So there was a grown up lying, and being believed, and I, only a child, was not. And that made me determined never to be like that French teacher. No matter what it cost I was going to stay on the side of truth.

The next year there was a poetry contest which was open to the entire school, and judged by the head of the English department. The entries weren't screened, or I'd never have got one in. My poem won the contest, and my home room teacher predictably said, "Madeleine couldn't possibly have written that poem. She's not very bright, you know. She must have copied it from some place."

So my mother went up to school, bearing the large body of work I had produced when I should have been doing homework, and it had to be conceded that Madeleine could have written that poem after all.

I was taken out of that school and sent to another, where I had a homeroom teacher on her very first teaching job. She was the first person to see any potential in this shy, awkward child. She affirmed me, gave me extra work to do. I remember she had me write a sequel to the Oddessey with Telemachus as the hero. Her honoring of me helped the other students to see me as something more than the girl who was bad at relay races. I didn't have instant popularity, but I began to make friends. I did my homework with enthusiasm, because my teacher challenged me.

Her name was Margaret Clapp, and she was to become the eighth president of Wellesley. So I had the benefit of being taught by a woman who was not only a great educator, but a great person, and perhaps it is only a great educator who understands that part of education is affirming each person she encounters as being intrinsically valuable. My previous teachers had estimated me as worthless; Miss Clapp gave me a sense of value, that it was all right to be me, that my lack of athletic skills was more than compensated for by other skills, that imagination was important.

Miss Clapp also helped me into a creative realism. I gave up some impossible dreams of making the longest or the highest jumps in gym; I accepted that I had a bad knee and that this would prevent me from being a great athlete, but I also accepted that not everybody has to be a great athlete. I learned to be willing to be who I was, not the plastic model of who I had thought I wanted to be. It was not that I didn't attempt the impossible. I did. But it was the impossible in areas where I already showed promise. My sequel to the Oddessey was probably pretty terrible, but it was a good example of the right kind of impossible, the impossible that called into play the gifts I already had, the gift of gab, the gift of putting words together articulately, the gift of imagination.

I hope that you have encountered teachers who understand the importance of imagination, that part of the brain which goes beyond cognition to intuition. A recent article in the New York Times dealt with the discovery that there is far more to the brain than the conscious part which is concerned with facts and proof, and that many, if not most major discoveries have been made with the intuitive part of the brain when the scientist is thinking, but has relaxed, so that the whole brain can work, and not just the conscious, controllable area.

Of course this is a masculine discovery, new to the male of the species but not to the female. Women have been allowed by society to be far more whole then men; we have not been forced to repress our inner selves, our intuitive, imaginative, numinous side. We have been allowed to go down into the darkness of unexpectedness, whereas men have been forced by society to limit themselves to the reasonable, the rational, the provable.

I, too, went to a women's college, Smith college. One great advantage of a women's college is that whatever there is to be done, we women do. If there is a magazine to be started, we start it. If there is an officer to be elected, one of us will be elected. I left college and went to New York to earn my living with the assurance that all doors were of course open to me, and that's a good attitude to have. If you expect doors to be open, they're likely to be open. If you expect them to be closed, they're likely to slam in your face. And I left college having majored in English literature, having spent four years with great writers, with an understanding that intellect and intuition were equally important.

In Greek mythology the intellect is masculine, Apollo driving the chariot of the sun across the sky, whereas wisdom is feminine, Sophia, or better, Hagia Sophia, holy wisdom. It is quite possible to be intellectual without any wisdom whatsoever, and this is always disastrous. And wisdom without intellect can be too otherworldly to be effective. It is when the two work together that true maturity can be realized. It is when the two work together that our wonderful minds can turn us towards truth. Intellect alone wants facts, provable facts; intellect working with wisdom can understand that truth goes far beyond and transcends facts. One of my early home room teachers accused me of "telling a story." She was not complimenting me on my fertile imagination; she was making the deadly accusation that I was telling a lie. It is only when the brain is limited to the cognitive alone that story can be confused with untruth, whereas story is one of the most potent vehicles of truth available to the human being.

Now, when I am talking about male and female I am not talking about men vs women, because we all have a marvelous combination of male and female within us, and part of maturing is learning to balance these two components so that they are the most fertile. It is only then that we are able to make creative choices and to understand that we do indeed have choices.

I have had the pleasure of living with my two granddaughters during their college years, and not long ago we were having dinner with several of their classmates, and one young woman said that their Women's Studies professor had told them that any woman who married and had children and who wrote, was a martyr. My granddaughter, Charlotte, looked at me, asking, "Gran, were you a martyr?" I replied, "No, Charlotte, I was not a martyr. I chose my own conflicts. They were indeed conflicts, but I chose them. No one forced me to marry, to have children, to continue to go on writing. It was my free choice. So there's no way I could be a martyr."

Don't fall into martyrdom! That's a choice, too. So is being a victim. I don't like that word. When bad things happen it is up to me to choose to be a victim or to get on with it. Terrible things can happen to us, rape, accident, bereavement; life is precarious and full of the unexpected, but we do not have to become victims, no matter what happens. That is a choice, and one we do not have to make. If we chose to remain ourselves, full of potential, then we can take whatever happens and redeem it by openness, courage, and willingness to move on. As women it is our responsibility to use all parts of ourselves, male and female, intellect and intuition, conscious and subconscious minds.

From my college reading of Aristotle's Poetics I remember particularly this phrase, "That which is plausible and impossible is better than that which is possible and implausible," and that has had a profound effect on my adult life. When we believe in the impossible, it becomes possible, and we can do all kinds of extraordinary things. We can balance the male and female within us like an acrobat in the circus, and that balancing act is one of the most important choices open to US. We can dare to enter the vulnerable intimacy of friendship and love. Some of you will choose the underrated job of homemaker, of wife and mother. Some of you will go single-mindedly after a career. Some of you, like me, will make the difficult choice of choosing both but then, as I used to tell my children, nothing that's easy is really worth very much, and just because it's difficult is no reason not to try.

Remember that one of the glories of being human is that we are fallible. We are the creatures who learn by making mistakes. I don't know about you, but I learn by what I do wrong, not by what I do right. An ant does not have this privilege. In ant societies if an ant deviates from the pattern that ant is a goner. Ants do not have the freedom of choice that we have.

So my hope for all of you is that you have been affirmed as valuable during these college years, and that you leave here knowing who you are, what your strengths are, and what your weaknesses are, and that the greatest human beings are a marvelous mixture of both. I hope that you know that you have choices, and that you have the freedom to discover what is true for you, and to follow that choice. Miss Clapp gave me the gift of being willing to know myself, with realism, and with hope. She was the first person to help me to know where and how I could break through the possible to the impossible, and to understand that it is when we plunge into something difficult that we are given whatever tools we need. She helped to start me on what has been and is still a fascinating journey, full of unexpected joys and sorrows and challenges. So I hope the same for you, that you will use fully the Apollo, the intellect, which is a great glory, and rejoice equally in Sophia, the wisdom which makes the intellect creative instead of destructive. Women are needed in a world which is hung up on the literal, the provable. So go out there with courage and imagination and be fully whoever you are, because that is who you are meant to be. Then the impossible becomes possible, and you will give hope wherever you are.

Go, and God bless you.

Even the best of revolutions can go awry when we internalize the attitudes we are fighting. The class of 1992 is graduating into a violent backlash against the advances women have made over the last 20 years. This backlash ranges from a Senator using "The Exorcist" against Anita Hill, to beer commercials with the "Swedish bikini team." Today I want to give you a backlash survival kit, a four-step manual to keep the dragons from taking up residence inside your own heads.

My own commencement, at Yale, eight years ago, was the Graduation from Hell. The speaker was Dick Cavett, rumored to have been our president's "brother" in an all-male secret society.

Mr. Cavett took the microphone and paled at the sight of hundreds of female about-to-be-Yale graduates. "When I was an undergraduate," I recall he said, "there were no women. The women went to Vassar. At Vassar, they had nude photographs taken of the women in gym class to check their posture. One year the photos were stolen, and turned up for sale in New Haven's red-light district." His punchline? "The photos found no buyers."

I'll never forget that moment. There we were, silent in our black gowns, our tassels, our brand new shoes. We dared not break the silence with hisses or boos, out of respect for our families, who'd come so far; and they kept still out of concern for us. Consciously or not, Mr. Cavett was using the beauty myth aspect of the backlash: when women come too close to masculine power, someone will draw critical attention to their bodies. We might be Elis, but we still wouldn't make pornography worth buying.

That afternoon, several hundred men were confirmed in the power of a powerful institution. But many of the women felt the shame of the powerless: the choking on silence, the complicity, the helplessness. We were orphaned from the institution.

I want to give you the commencement talk that was denied to me.

Message No. 1 in your survival kit: redefine "becoming a woman." Today you have "become women." But that sounds odd in ordinary usage. What is usually meant by "You're a real women [sic] now"? You "become a woman" when you menstruate for the first time, or when you lose your virginity, or when you have a child.

These biological definitions are very different from how we say boys become men. One "becomes a man" when he undertakes responsibility, or completes a quest. But you, too, in some ways more than your male friends graduating today, have moved into maturity through a solitary quest for the adult self.

We lack archetypes for the questing young woman, her trials by fire; for how one "becomes a woman" through the chrysalis of education, the difficult passage from one book, one idea to the next. Let's refuse to have our scholarship and our gender pitted against each other. In our definition, the scholar learns womanhood and the woman learns scholarship; Plato and Djuna Barnes, mediated to their own enrichment through the eyes of the female body with its wisdoms and its gifts.

I say that you have already shown courage: Many of you graduate today in spite of the post-traumatic syndrome of acquaintance rape, which one-fourth of female students undergo. Many of you were so weakened by anorexia and bulimia that it took every ounce of your will to get your work in. You negotiated private lives through a mine field of new strains of VD and the ascending shadow of AIDS. Triumphant survivors, you have already "become women."

Message No. 2 breaks the ultimate taboo for women. _Ask for money in your lives._ Expect it. Own it. Learn to use it. Little girls learn a debilitating fear of money -- that it's not feminine to insure we are fairly paid for honest work. Meanwhile, women make 68 cents for every male dollar and half of marriages end in divorce, after which women's income drops precipitously.

Never choose a profession for material reasons. But whatever field your heart decides on, for god's sake get the most specialized training in it you can and hold out hard for just compensation, parental leave and child care. Resist your assignment to the class of highly competent, grossly underpaid women who run the show while others get the case -- and the credit. Claim money not out of greed, but so you can tithe to women's political organizations, shelters and educational institutions. Sexist institutions won't yield power if we are just patient long enough. The only language the status quo understands is money, votes and public embarrassment.

When you have equity, you have influence -- as sponsors, shareholders and alumnae. Use it to open opportunities to women who deserve the chances you've had. Your B.A. does not belong to you alone, just as the earth does not belong to its present tenants alone. Your education was lent to you by women of the past, and you will give some back to living women, and to your daughters seven generations from now.

Message No. 3: Never cook for or sleep with anyone who routinely puts you down.

Message No. 4: Become goddesses of disobedience. Virginia Woolf once wrote that we must slay the Angel in the House, the censor within. Young women tell me of injustices, from campus rape coverups to classroom sexism. But at the thought of confrontation, they freeze into niceness. We are told that the worst thing we can do is cause conflict, even in the service of doing right. Antigone is imprisoned. Joan of Arc burns at the stake. And someone might call us unfeminine!

When I wrote a book that caused controversy, I saw how big a dragon was this paralysis by niceness. "The Beauty Myth" argues that newly rigid ideals of beauty are instruments of a backlash against feminism, designed to lower women's self-esteem for a political purpose. Many positive changes followed the debate. But all that would dwindle away when someone yelled at me -- as, for instance, cosmetic surgeons did on TV, when I raised questions about silicone implants. Oh, no, I'd quail, people are mad at me!

Then I read something by the poet Audre Lorde. She'd been diagnosed with breast cancer. "I was going to die," she wrote, "sooner or later, whether or not I had even spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silences will not protect you.... What are the words you do not yet have? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken and die of them, still in silence? We have been socialized to respect fear more than our own need for language."

I began to ask each time: "What's the worst that could happen to me if I tell this truth?" Unlike women in other countries, our breaking silence is unlikely to have us jailed, "disappeared" or run off the road at night. Our speaking out will irritate some people, get us called bitchy or hypersensitive and disrupt some dinner parties. And then our speaking out will permit other women to speak, until laws are changed and lives are saved and the world is altered forever.

Next time, ask: What's the worst that will happen? Then push yourself a little further than you dare. Once you start to speak, people will yell at you. They will interrupt you, put you down and suggest it's personal. And the world won't end.

And the speaking will get easier and easier. And you will find you have fallen in love with your own vision, which you may never have realized you had. And you will lose some friends and lovers, and realize you don't miss them. And new ones will find you and cherish you. And you will still flirt and paint your nails, dress up and party, because, as I think Emma Goldman said, "If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution." And at last you'll know with surpassing certainty that only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.

My fellow Trojans, for those of you who canÕt see me today, I look exactly like Robert Redford.

Before I begin, IÕm just curious about one thing. I would like to see the hands of all the graduates who believe that they are better off today than they were four years ago.

Now a follow-up question. I would like to see the hands of all those who think that Woody Allen is having a mid-life crisis.

As I look down on your smiling faces, I am reminded of a cartoon in the New Yorker magazine.

It shows a boy in cap and gown and his father is saying to him, ÔCongratulations, son, you are now a man. You owe me $370,000.Õ

Dr. Sample, I canÕt tell you how happy I am to receive an honorary degree today. I donÕt know if I deserve it, but I want it.

This moment is a highlight for me because my own school has seen fit to recognize me. This university has changed so much since I was here in 1948. When I attended USC, there was nothing but buffalo as far as the eye could see.

I would like to set the record straight about my educational credentials. When I was 16 years old, World War II started, and I was afraid it would be over before I got in. So I ran away from high school to join the Marine Corps. While I was in the Marines, I realized if I ever hoped to get out, IÕd better go to college. But I didnÕt have a high school diploma. So I went down to USC to find out what I would have to take in night high school to make up the grades. But before I could ask what I needed, they enrolled me, assuming no one would try to register if they didnÕt have a high school diploma.

A year later, they called me in and said, ÔYou donÕt have a high school diploma.Õ

I said, ÔI know.Õ

They said, ÔYouÕre not supposed to be in college.Õ

I said, ÔI know. What do you want me to do now?Õ

They said theyÕd make me a special student.

I said, ÔWhat does that mean?Õ

They said, ÔYou canÕt work for a degree.Õ

I said, ÔI donÕt care about that. If I donÕt have a high school diploma, thereÕs no sense having a college degree.Õ

So I went for three years and had a ball. Now, 42 years later, they have given me a degree, which confirms what I have been saying all along: All of you graduates today have wasted your
time.

Now although I never participated in any USC athletics, I did make a vital contribution to the athletics program: I took the English tests for the football team.

I thought I was doing a good job until the tackle complained to the coach that I got him a D in Shakespeare, and was hurting his chances of getting into medical school.

I am not here today to bring you a message of doom. I say the class of 1993 is the luckiest one that ever graduated Ñ and probably the last. My message to you today is that we, the older
generation, have given you a perfect world Ñ so donÕt screw it up.

You are the generation of Madonna, Nike sneakers and Ross Perot. You canÕt find work, and you canÕt get health insurance, and NBC puts firecrackers on your pickup trucks.

But I donÕt feel sorry for you. As I told Hillary Clinton the other day, ÔWe never promised you a Rose Garden.Õ

The tendency these days is to wring our hands and say everything is rotten, but I donÕt feel that way. I am basically an optimist Ñ otherwise I would never drive on the San Diego Freeway.

I know that many of you are angry with our generation because we left you a $4 trillion debt. Well, I would like to remind you of one thing: It was our money and we could do anything we wanted with it.

I donÕt know if this is the best of times or the worst of times. But I can assure you of this: ItÕs the only time youÕve got. So you can either stay in bed or go out and pick a daisy.

We seem to be going through a period of nostalgia, and everyone seems to think that yesterday was better than today. I personally donÕt think it was Ñ and if youÕre hung up on nostalgia, my advice is to pretend that today is yesterday and go out and have a helluva time.

For starters, there are many things you can do after the ceremony is over today. I would recommend hugging your parents and grandparents as hard as you possibly could. I would ask your favorite professor for his or her autograph. And finally, I would take one last walk around the campus with someone you love. I am not one of these graduation speakers who is going to tell you how to make a better world. I am here to give you practical advice on how to deal with the real jungle out there.

For example, some of you may have chosen to become doctors. If you do, my advise to you is get as much malpractice insurance as you possibly can. Because for every student graduated from USC medical school today, there are two students graduating from the law school waiting to kill you.

Then youÕre probably wondering if there will be any jobs waiting for you when you finish your schooling. You have nothing to worry about. I can assure you that out of this class of 7,900 students, 131 of you are going to find jobs. I know who you are, but IÕm not at liberty to tell you.

The most important piece of advice I can give you in your job hunting is that every time you make a phone call, there will always be some secretary trying to stonewall you who wonÕt let you speak to the person you want to.

Secretaries are very protective of their bosses, and theydemand to know what your business is and what youÕre calling about.

Now this is how I suggest you handle this, because this is the way I handle it. Whenever a secretary says to me, in a very snooty voice, ÔMay I inquire what youÕre calling about?Õ I say,
ÔTell Mr. Golson, IÕm at his house with a truckload of pork bellies that he bought in the commodities market. Does he want me to dump them on his lawn or stuff them in the cellar?Õ

If that doesnÕt work, the second one usually does: ÔTell Mr. Golson we just got his tests back from the lab.Õ

And if that one fails, this one never has: ÔTell Mr. Golson I just found his American Express Card on a bed at the Silk Pussycat Motel. Does he want me to bring it in or mail it to him?Õ

My final message to you today is that I could have said something profound, but you would have forgotten it in 15 minutes Ñ which is the afterlife of a graduation speech.

Therefore, I chose to give this kind of speech, so that 20 years from today, when your children ask you what you did on graduation day, you can say, ÔI laughed.Õ

Thank you.

Thank you President Berk, trustees, faculty, staff and students of Berklee, and guests. Johnny Mandel, who is also being honored here today.

I understand that there are over five hundred students in this graduating class. What an amazing thing. When I was a young musician, the only option available to pursue secondary education in music was to attend a classical conservatory. Obviously, I didn't choose that route, and although the one I ended up taking has been rather circuitous, I am truly pleased that the road has twisted and turned its way up the East Coast to Boston. The Berklee College of Music represents the finest contemporary music school there is, and I am honored to be here with you this morning to celebrate the 1993 Commencement.

I have been asked many times, "Why do musicians give so much time to charitable causes?" I know a few musicians who are motivated by pure guilt—the result of a dissolute and misspent youth combined with the onset of remorse and middle age. I am not as remote from these few as I would like to think. Some are motivated to activism by a sincere idealism, which musicians and artists in general must have in spades to be able to deal with the disappointments and cynicism we all encounter in what seems an often endlessly futile labor of love. Perhaps it is mainly because musicians want to be the loud voice for so many quiet hearts.Maybe it's because we know what it is like to be completely alone, to be unemployed, to have to struggle. Historically, musicians know what it is like to be outside the norm—walking the high wire without a safety net. Our experience is not so different from those who march to the beat of different drummers. We experience similar difficulties, weakness, failures and sadness, but we also celebrate the joys and successes—these are the things that we translate and express in music.

And still, we hear the same question: So when are you going to get a real job? How many times have you been asked this question or some incarnation thereof? Beethoven heard it. John Lennon heard it. Milli Vanilli heard it. Bob Marley heard it. Janis Joplin heard it. Tchaikovsky heard it. Charlie Parker heard it, Verdi, Debussy. When I was 19, I made my first good week's pay as a club musician. It was enough money for me to quit my job at the factory and still pay the rent and buy some food. I freaked. I ran home and tore off my clothes and jumped around my tiny little apartment shouting "I'm a musician, I'm a musician!" It was one of the greatest days of my fife, just to be able to make a living as a musician alone, to earn money doing what I loved to do.

Artist—musicians, painters, writers, poets—always seem to have had the most accurate perception of what is really going on around them, not the official version or the popular perception of contemporary life. When I look at great works of art or listen to inspired music, I sense intimate portraits of the specific times in which they were created. And they have lasted because someone, somewhere felt compelled to create it, and someone else understood what they were trying to do. Why do we still respond when we bear the opening notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony—DA DA DA DA? Or Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue? Or Little Richard's Tutti Fruitti? Because when we hear it we realize that we are still bound by a common emotion to those who came before us. Like family, we are irrevocably tied to each other because that same emotion still exists today. This is what all good musicians understand.

I can't think of one person I've ever met who didn't like some type of music. More than art, more than literature, music is universally accessible. For whatever reason, not all people are born with the particular gift that we have: the gift of being able to express ourselves through music. And, believe me, it is a gift. But people who don't have this ability still need to find a way to give a voice to what they're thinking and feeling, to find something that connects them with others. As human beings, we need to know that we are not alone, that we are not crazy or that we are all completely out of our minds, that there are other people out there who feel as we do, who live as we do, who love as we do, who are like us.

Music does this in such a complete and uncomplicated way. There is great magic in this. In a way, we are magicians. We are alchemists, sorcerers and wizards. We are a very strange bunch. But there is great fun in being a wizard. And great power, too.

Nowadays, we are living in a time when American popular music is finally being recognized as one of our most successful exports. The demand is huge. The whole world loves American movies, blue jeans, jazz and rock and roll. And it is probably a better way to get to know our country than by what the politicians or airline commercials represent. Musicians now find themselves in the unlikely position of being legitimate. At least the IRS thinks so. Once they discovered that we were actually capable of making "money," the free ride was over. No one eludes Uncle Sam's tax man anymore like they did in the old days when we were outlaws, hippies, beatniks and weirdoes and—the most shadowy group of all—jazz players! No, we're all corporations and contractors and production companies now—and by the way, I hope most of you have taken some basic accounting courses and have a lawyer in the family. You're going to need both.

So why do musicians give so much time to charitable causes? There are many reasons, but the most humanitarian cause that we can give our time to is the creation and performance of music itself. That is the gift we have been given, that is our destiny and our usefulness as human beings in the short time we have in this world. And that's plenty of reason.

And I hope you don't make music for some vast, unseen audience or market or ratings share or even for something as tangible as money. For though it's crucial to make a living, that shouldn't be your inspiration or your aspiration. Do it for yourself, your highest self, for your own pride, joy, ego, gratification, expression, love, fulfillment, happiness—whatever you want to call it. Do it because it's what you have to do. And if you make this music for the human needs you have within yourself, then you do it for all humans who need the same things. Ultimately, you enrich humanity with the profound expression of these feelings.

Now I have been both praised and criticized in my time. The criticism stung, but the praise sometimes bothered me even more. To have received such praise and honors like this has always been puzzling to me when I consider myself to be an inept pianist, a bad singer, and a merely competent songwriter. What I do, in my opinion, is by no means extraordinary. I am, as I've said, merely competent. But in an age of incompetence, that makes me extraordinary. Maybe that's why I've been able to last in this crazy business. I actually know how to play my ax, and write a song. That's my job.

So when are you going to get a real job? When are you going to get serious about life? I have news for them: When are you going to get a real job? This is a real job—as real as a doctor, a teacher, or a scientist and just as important as and very similar to healing, teaching and inventing. But even more fun because we have that wizard and sorcerer bit going for us. I have said before to those who have expressed doubts and misgivings about their ability to live this kind of life maybe they shouldn't try, because being a musician is not something you chose to be, it is something you are, like tall or short or straight or gay. There is no choice, either you is or you ain't.

Now, I'm sure it must be daunting to come in times of financial distress and unemployment. But consider this: have you Iistened to the radio lately? Have you heard the canned, frozen and processed product being dished up to the world as American popular music today? What an incredible opportunity for a new movement of American composers and musicians to shape what we will be listening to in the years to came. While most people are satisfied with the junk food being sold as music, you have the chance and the responsibility to show us what a real banquet music can be. You have learned the fine art of our native cuisine—blues, jazz gospel, Broadway, rock and roll and pop. After all this schooling, you should know how to cook! So cook away and give us the good stuff for a change. Please. We need it We need it very, very much. Congratulations and good luck!

Thank you so very much, Professor William Chace. I would first like to extend my congratulations to the Class of 1993 at Wesleyan University. Wesleyan University is a very special place. I recall my years at Yale: I would drive down once a week to go to the Malcolm X House as we reflected on the complexities of race and class and gender and sexual orientation, convinced that we were going to make this country and world a better place.

But the Class of 1993 is a special class in a special place. I know your history. You’ve been through some struggles, and it’s getting you ready for what the world has to offer. ‘Cause even in this grand moment of celebration and jubilation, we’re living in one of the most terrifying and frightening moments in the history of this country - unprecedented lethal linkage of economic decline and cultural decay and political malaise. Yes, the downward mobility and the poverty and fear of poverty. Yes, the cultural consumption that promotes an addiction to stimulation that tries to convince us that we are vital and vibrant only when we’re consuming. Down and out? Go to the mall. Feeling down and out? Turn on the television and reinforce that spectatorial passivity. Yes, that’s so much of what this culture is about. And the political malaise - even given Brother Clinton in the White House and Sister Hillary - thank god for her - this deep sense that maybe public institutions no longer have the wherewithal to respond to the deep problems.

Yes, that’s our moment. But I say to the Class of 1993 that you can make a fundamental difference. Not alone, but playing a very crucial role. And you can do it in the following way: You can try to revitalize public life; and by public life all I mean is acknowledging our interdependencies and interrelationships upon one another.

I’m not talking about simply identities, I’m not talking simply about constituencies. I’m talking about that rich notion of citizenship, the idea that ordinary people are capable of ruling or being ruled. And hence, putting a premium on the alternation of rule and the rotation of rulers. It’s a precious ideal. It’s called democracy. And how rare democracies are in human history, and usually short-lived. And when they’re undermined, it usually has much to do with the levels of poverty that produce a despair and desperation, or levels of paranoia that produce levels of distrust and suspicion.

But my advice, my humble advice, to the Class of 1993 is to expand public conversation in this democracy by first having a deep and abiding sense of history. And how un-American that is, to cut against the grain. Henry Ford, in many ways an exemplary American - not simply a genius of invention and innovation creating that automobile that exemplifies mobility and individuality, but also the same Henry ford with the ugly anti-Semitic sensibilities from Detroit - but Henry Ford said, History is bunk. He spoke for so many Americans: History is bunk. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, Everything good is on the highway. It’s Huck on the boat. It’s Ahab on the ship. It’s Kerouac on the road. It’s Louis Armstrong on and off the beat. It’s Sarah Vaughn in the blues. It’s James Brown on the good foot.

But, I say to you, one must have a tragic sense of history. Hegel said, History is a slaughterhouse because of the blood, sweat and tears. Gibbon said, It’s a series of human crimes and follies and misfortunes. And we know, yes, history is inextricably interwoven with scars and bruises and wounds and hurts and heartache and sorrow and grief, but it’s more than that. We ought not to confuse the tragic with the pathetic. The tragic is about the exploration of human possibilities for freedom. That’s what Sophocles’ Antigone is about. That’s what Shakespeare’s King Lear is about. That’s what Toni Morrison’s Beloved is about: the exploration of the human possibilities of freedom, but hitting up against limits sooner or later.

A tragic sense of history will give you a view of the world in which no culture and no civilization and no society has a monopoly on wisdom or virtue. It would allow you to see ambiguous legacies in the past, to accent hybrid cultures, because every culture that we know is based in part on fragments of antecedent cultures. No pure and pristine traditions here. No Manichaean visions. No either/or perspectives here. It’s about complexity and subtlety. And going hand in hand with that tragic sense of history is an all-embracing moral vision, because a tragic sense of history should generate a sense of empathy and sympathy, of trying to identify with the frustrations and anxieties of others, of those who look other and come from other places and have other sexual orientations. All-embracing moral vision - never losing sight of the humanity of others.

Simone Weil, the great French Jewish philosopher, said it well when she said, “Love of thy neighbor and all of its fullness - being able to say to him or her, ‘What are you going through? Can I be of service?’” And, yes it’s true that an all-embracing moral vision means that we have to cut against the grain because we live in a moment of xenophobic frenzy, of groups and tribes and clans and nations that want to close ranks, put up thick walls of demarcation, make it more difficult to build the kind of bridges that we know are requisite to create not simply a sustainable, but a just society and world.

And hand in hand with an all-embracing moral vision is in many ways the most difficult, self-critical courageous stands. And Friedrick Nietzsche said it well when he said, “It’s not simply a question of having the courage of one’s convictions, but at times having the courage to attack one’s convictions.” That’s how you grow. That how you mature. That’s how you develop. Look at Malcolm X himself, what a great example of a man who was willing to grow because he realized that he had to attack, at times, his own convictions. Socrates said it well when he said, “the unexamined life is not worth living.” but we need to add that the examined life is painful, risky, full of vulnerability. And, yet, to revitalize public conversation, we have to ensure that self-criticism and self-correction are accented both in our individual lives, as well as in our society and world.

Last, but not least, there is a need for audacious hope. And it’s not optimism. I’m in no way an optimist. I’ve been black in America for 39 years. No ground for optimism here, given the progress and regress and three steps forward and four steps backward. Optimism is a notion that there’s sufficient evidence that would allow us to infer that if we keep doing what we’re doing, things will get better. I don’t believe that. I’m a prisoner of hope, that’s something else. Cutting against the grain, against the evidence. William James said it so well in that grand and masterful essay of his of 1879 called “The Sentiment of Rationality,” where he talked about faith being the courage to act when doubt is warranted. And that’s what I’m talking about.

Of course I come from a tradition, a black church tradition, in which we defined faith as stepping out on nothing and landing on something. That’s the history of black folk in this country. Hope against hope. And yet still trying to sustain the notion that we world-weary and tired peoples, all peoples in this society, can be energized and galvanized around causes and principles and ideals that are bigger than us, that can appeal to the better angels of our nature, so that we, in fact, can reach the conclusion that the world in incomplete - that history in unfinished, that the future is open-ended, that what we think and what we do does make a difference.

So, to the Class of 1993, I say with you, as Earth, Wind and Fire put it so well a few decades ago, “Keep you head to the sky,” or as the civil rights movement said so clearly, “Keep you eyes on the prize,” not on each other, but on the prize. And as Mahalia Jackson used to sing so powerfully, Keep your hand on the plow.

God bless you, good luck, and let’s try to make this world a better place by example and by struggle. Thank you so very much.

I'm so happy to be here today. Now, I don't want you to worry about looking silly in these mortarboards. It's kind of a funny tradition, isn't it? Congratulations! You've spent the last four years slavishly working your heart out, you've got the entire faculty and all your family assembled here, now slap this flat thing on your head and go out there and look proud. Well, you should be proud. I'm proud of you. Perhaps we should just decide that you're wearing these to teach you something about balance, the key to a happy life. You can use that if you want.

Life's a funny thing, isn't it? As I look out at all of you today, I ask myself, How did I get here? I know, but how is it that I find myself standing in front of what can only be called an assembly, a captive audience, saying what's on my mind? It's surprising. But life is surprising and that's a good thing, because it's nice to know that when you least expect it, things can take a sudden turn for the better. You can actually have the life that you think only happens to other people. Isn't that wonderful?

Now, at this moment you all are going through an experience I never had. I didn't graduate from college. No, I was dedicating my life to the theatre and God forbid I should muddy the artistic waters with anything as unromantic as an actual college degree! And to this day, if pressed, I can still get my mother to say, "...but you'd just feel so much better about yourself if you'd just finish!" And you know what, Mom? You're right, but whenever I start feeling those pangs, I just go in my office, close the door and clutch my Oscar till it passes.

But knowing I was going to be here today got me thinking about the time in my life when I left college. I had just spent three and a half years studying drama--at Purdue University, a school known for having the best...agriculture and engineering departments in the Midwest. Much the same as going to study quantum physics at Juilliard. My sister drove up to help me move my stuff. She came into my apartment and said, "Holy mother of God, this is gonna take two trips." Does that sound familiar to anyone at all?

All that stuff, and I don't have any of it now. But I was thinking about that time in my life when I was the age that most of you are now, and I couldn't help but think, "Boy, if I knew then what I know now, things would have been a lot different." Because I'll tell you the truth, when I left school, I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I did. I had a plan, or a semblance of a plan, but between then and now, I was led or went willingly down several varieties of garden path. I made some wrong turns, U-turns, did donuts in the parking lot, went uphill, downhill and sometimes I just coasted. I traveled a lot of roads, and once or twice I even made a road where there was no road before. The point is, as misguided as it seemed at the time, it all added up to something. Cumulatively, it added up to a life that's happier for the distance I've traveled, wiser for the mistakes I've made, stronger for the things I've overcome, richer for the experience I've earned, some of which I'd probably trade back for the time, but maybe not. Now, understand, I'm not recommending my path to you. If you can hop on the straight and narrow, by all means, do that.

But along the way, I learned some things that I thought I'd pass along to you in the hope that maybe, at the very least, I could save you some time.

One of the wisest things I learned in college was something that I read on a bathroom wall, which I know is a pretty sad statement, but one that taught me to take your wisdom where you can find it. And what it said was: Recognize your limitations, and sure enough, they're yours. Now this really stayed with me through the years and I'm glad I had the good fortune to read it. Because the world will provide you with every imaginable obstacle, but the one most difficult to overcome will be the lack of faith in yourself. Leave it to others to have doubts about you. In fact, I suggest keeping a list of those names, because later on, when you've succeeded beyond your wildest expectations, you can drop them a line, thanking them for their support.

I didn't start writing until I was 30 years old. And the thing that's odd about that is that before that, if you could get me to tell you my deepest, darkest secret, my private, foolish dream, I would have told you that I had a sneaking suspicion that I could write. But truthfully, I was afraid. I was afraid that I couldn't do it, that I wouldn't be good enough, that I would make a fool of myself. I was worried about what people would think of me. And this brings me to my first big tip: DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK OF YOU, because first of all, they're not thinking about you. In all likelihood, they're worried about what you're thinking about them. Anybody who thinks less of you for following a dream isn't worth worrying about anyway. They're probably just envious because it takes a lot of courage to follow your heart and your instincts, and it's not always pretty, and it's not for the fainthearted but it leads right into my next, and maybe most important tip which is:

DON'T BE AFRAID TO HAVE A DREAM. Because one of the most amazing things about this life is that dreams can become reality, and I offer myself as living proof. With perseverance, faith, and luck, and by luck I mean, when opportunity meets preparation, truly incredible things can happen to you. I promise you one thing. It won't be easy, but it's easier than spending your life wishing that you'd done something, and feeling disappointed in yourself for never having tried. That's the true hell. So go on and do the thing that scares the hell out of you, because in this world, not unlike Hollywood, the gamble is almost as safe a bet as the sure thing.

And also, when you give yourself the gift of quietly believing in yourself, you'll love yourself. And now for another tip. It is of paramount importance for you to figure out as soon as possible that YOU MUST DO THINGS THAT MAKE YOU LOVE YOURSELF. I'm sure you've all heard the line, "If you don't first love yourself, you can never truly love anyone else." Well, that's true. No one in the world can solve the problems of one who does not love herself, and you can spend years thinking that if someone could just love me the right way, then everything will be okay. And that's true, it's just that that someone is you. Because I know so well how easy it is to be hard on yourself, too hard, and how unforgiving one can be when it comes to one's own shortcomings. And of course, some healthy self-criticism is good, but I also know how negative voices inside you can get carried away, until that's all you hear.

So here's a little reality check, a little systems analysis you can run just to see if you may be bearing down on yourself a little too hard. Would you have a friend who talks to you the way you talk to yourself? Would you say to a friend the kind of things that you say to yourself? For instance, let's say you, like I, perpetually misplace your keys. In fact, except for the few moments that they are actually in my hand, my keys are always lost, and by now, if you rack up all the hours I've spent looking for them, I could have learned a language or become proficient on a musical instrument. I could have gone into politics, and maybe even become president, but I couldn't, because I couldn't find my keys.

Now, I happen to know that in my case this is an inherited characteristic passed down on my mother's side, and from what I understand, researchers at Stanford are very close to isolating the lost key gene, and I'm on the list to have gene replacement therapy so as not to pass it on to my own offspring. But do you, when looking for your keys find yourself saying things to yourself like, "You idiot! You're just lucky your head's sewn on! Why can't you just figure out how to put them in one place? I can't believe how STUPID you are, you stupid, stupid idiot!" or do you say, "Now, let's see, where would someone who's got really important things on her mind, leave her keys?"

See what I'm getting at? Don't listen to things from yourself that you wouldn't accept from a friend. You wouldn't want a friend who wasn't supportive, so don't accept any less from yourself. You're only human, so learn to forgive yourself the little things, and do the best you can on the big things. No one is perfect, and expecting perfection from yourself or anyone else is a waste of time.

Now, what if you don't have a dream? Some of you may be sitting there thinking, "What in the hell is she talking about? I have no idea, not the foggiest idea what I should do with my life!" and I want to speak to this, because I think that this may be the single most difficult dilemma that you will ever be faced with. And one that garners no sympathy from those more fortunate, who have always known what they wanted to do. There are those who will say you're simply lazy, and you may come to believe this about yourself. All I'm going to tell you is try anything and everything, search high and low until you find something, not somebody, something that you love. Time is like money. Invest now in yourself for a big dividend later. You're going to have to be in it for the long haul, exactly like everyone else, but know that doors will open to you that you didn't even know were there. Some of you may be overcome with the feeling that there's something you're supposed to be doing, but you just don't know what it is. That happens. But if you're going to pray for anything in your life, pray that you be put on your proper path, because life lived with a sense of purpose and commitment is just a lot more rewarding than one that drifts. So: DO find a cause, something you believe in, and get behind it. This world is in a lot of trouble, and it needs all the help it can get. DON'T sit on the sidelines wishing things would change, wishing this were a different kind of world. It can be a different kind of world, but it's gonna take a lot of women exactly like you to help change it. And you can. And I don't want to hear any back talk about it.

Now, I'll give you a little piece of advice that my mother, thankfully, gave me, and that is: No matter what it is you decide to do, make sure that you choose something that will provide you with an income on which you can take care of yourself. Yes, right after she told me that I decided to go into acting, but as time went on, I realized the value of her words. Now don't worry about being poor in your twenties. It's a pain, but you can work with it. But later on, it's more difficult, and there's not a lot of glory in being an adult dependent. But, there is a lot of satisfaction in knowing you can make your own way in the world. Self-sufficiency is an extremely worthwhile goal. You have to know now that you can survive anything and should all else fail, you can make it on your own and be happy. Thanks, Mom.

Now, you know how they always tell you that later, when you're older, your face will clear up? It won't. I'm just gonna tell you that now so you can get on with your life. I'm still waiting to lose my baby fat. I've waited my whole life to gradually grow into looking exactly like Claudia Schiffer, and I can see now that it's not going to happen. Maybe some of you do that. Maybe some of you spend time looking into the mirror, thinking, "I'm too fat!" or, in extremely rare cases, "I'm too thin!" I'm sure that each one of you could give me a fairly detailed list of your physical imperfections, as I could do the same about myself. Here's a really important tip, and you might want to write this one down: FOR EVERY FIVE MINUTES YOU SPEND LOOKING INTO A MIRROR, SPEND FIVE TIMES THAT AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING OUT AT THE WORLD. In reality, your happiness has a lot more to do with how you see the world than how the world sees you. Time is our most limited resource. Don't waste it on things that aren't important. How you look is not nearly as important as who you are. If you want to learn to make yourself beautiful, do it from the inside out. Do what I did--learn to make it on your personality. Personality is the one quality that doesn't fade with time.

There was a parish, where the old pastor was retiring and a new pastor was coming in. The pastor arrived, and she was a woman. Three of the older men in the church had taken the old pastor fishing every Thursday afternoon and they said, well, we always took him fishing, let's take her fishing. So Thursday morning they load up the boat and out they go. A quiet day, but round about four o'clock the fish really start biting. The pastor says, "This is great, guys, but unfortunately, I've got to get back." They say, "Well, that's too bad. We're not leaving while the fish are biting like this." And she says, "Well, I'm sorry, but I've got a meeting at five." And they say, "Well, we're sorry. You're just gonna have to swim." And she says, "Well, I have no intention of swimming," and she steps out of the boat and walks across the water back to shore. The guys just look at each other and one of 'em says, "Look at that. They send us a woman pastor and she can't even swim." You may encounter something like this in your upcoming foray into the world. You have been lucky so far, because you've been here for four years, where no one takes points off because of your gender. I wish so much that I could tell you that the world is free of sexism and that you will be judged only on the content of your character, not on the contents of your bra. But some of you will not find it so.

I come to you today as a feminist speaker...and it disturbs me to hear women, especially young women, distancing themselves from the word "feminist." I think they do it because there's a tendency to forget what the term means. It means, simply, "A doctrine advocating social, political, and economic rights for women equal to those of men." Anybody here have a problem with that? What it does not mean is anything pertaining to or associated with Lorena Bobbitt. It makes as much sense to include Lorena Bobbitt in a discussion of feminism as it does to include Jeffrey Dahmer in a discussion of vegetarianism. Feminists are often portrayed in the media as the female equivalent of a gorilla; hairy, dangerous, and unpredictable. This is a frightening characterization not only to men, but to women as well, and one that causes some to want to distance themselves from the term.

Another characterization is that feminists are women who want to be men. I'm here to say that feminism is the path that allowed me to take pride in being a woman. It is a movement to give value to women and their work--in and out of the home--not to diminish the value of men. The idea that the interests of women exist in opposition to men is nonsensical. Feminism is not based on the superiority of the gender, but rather on the removal of limitations based on gender. And if you agree with that, I've got some good news for you. You're a feminist.

I'm often asked what I do when faced with blatant sexism. I'm told, by many young women especially, that they feel that many of the young men they encounter are openly disrespectful toward them. On the rare occasions that that happens to me, I understand that it comes from a deficiency in him, a flaw in his character, not mine. When someone treats me in that way, I try to keep in mind that, in most cases, it probably stems more from ignorance, from some misplaced fear, than from real prejudice. Also, there is quite a bit of subtle, and not so subtle conditioning that goes on, that sends the message that it's okay to speak to, and treat women disrespectfully. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But what I do not do, is let it pass. Any more than I would let pass discrimination based on race, color, or religion, I do not tolerate it. I do not excuse it. If I accept it, it's bad for me and it's bad for him. And I'm telling you: the only way sexism can truly harm you is if you get used to it. Don't ever get used to it.

In the next few years, you're going to be getting a lot of advice. A lot of you are going to be dealing with parents and family that have your future all mapped out in their minds, and it may not have anything to do with who you are and what you want. In fact, your parents may seem not to know you at all, but you know what? Maybe they do. Possibly, they can see things in you that you can't see in yourself. And they have the experience of having been on the planet longer than you. They've seen more of what can go wrong. So here's another really fabulous tip:

LISTEN WITH AN OPEN HEART AND AN OPEN MIND TO THOSE WHO LOVE YOU THE MOST. You may hear a grain of truth that will later become the foundation of your entire belief system. My father told me that I would only find true happiness through accomplishment and fully realizing my potential. At the time, that sounded like one of those crummy things your father says while you're waiting for him to hand over the car keys (right before you're about to do something awful). It has nothing to do with your daily reality. But now, of course, I'm happiest when I'm accomplishing something that takes all of my best effort, where I feel I'm living up to my potential. My mother told me that I would feel deeply rewarded just by the act of completing something. Thelma and Louise was the first thing, that was totally my own, that I ever completed. Your parents may not know everything, but neither do you. Hear them out. And, parents: please, whatever mistakes you may see her make, don't lose hope. The faith you have in your daughter will see her through some hard times and help her through the parts where she may lose faith in herself. Again, thanks, Mom.

In closing, which I always say to give the audience a shred of hope, I'm going to give you the real down skinny. Here are some of the most important things you're ever gonna need to know:

Save yourself several thousand dollars and start flossing like a maniac now.
Always, in all circumstances, wear comfortable shoes. You never know when you may have to run for your life.
Never wear stockings that are darker than your shoes. Otherwise you get that Minnie Mouse look going and you want to avoid that.
Never argue with an idiot.
Practice everything in moderation except moderation, which you should practice in excess.
Be sure to have a hobby.
Marry late.
Don't forget to check for change in the coke machine.
Keep track of your friends.
Life is short, so cram as much fun into it as you possibly can.
Be here now, and JUST DO IT.
When I first moved to Los Angeles, I was waiting tables in a restaurant in Beverly Hills, and Gloria Steinem came in with another couple. I told the other waitress, excitedly, "Gloria Steinem just sat in your section!" She said, "Who's that?" I said, "Gimme that table!" I waited on her, trying not to come undone, because of course, Gloria Steinem was my idol when I was growing up in Paducah, Kentucky. She was everything that was cool about feminism. And finally at the end, I said, "Ms. Steinem, I just want to thank you for everything that you've done. I know that your work has made the world just a little better for the women of my generation, and I just want you to know, I really appreciate it." She very graciously said, "It's been my pleasure, but there's so much more to do, so all I ask is that you carry on."

And I have been happily trying to oblige ever since. There have been a lot of women and men who have gone before us lighting the way, knocking down walls, opening doors, kicking ass and taking names, so the way for those of us coming up behind them might be just a little bit easier. So today, I ask you to remember them...And with all my high hopes, congratulations, and best wishes for your future...Carry on!

So I'm standing here in a strange hat and a strange, flowing gown in front of what looks very much like an audience, and I'm about to do something that I don't do very often, which is to make speeches in public. And I'm asking myself how I managed to end up here?

This was never in any plan I'd outlined for myself. Nevertheless, I'm here and you're all expecting something coherent, and perhaps meaningful, to come out of my mouth. I'll try, but there are no guarantees. And I have to say I'm a little bit nervous. You might think this is strange for a man who makes his living playing in stadiums, but I often stand in the middle of a stadium full of people and ask myself the same question, "how the hell did I end up here?" The simple answer is I'm a musician. And for some reason I've never had any other ambition but to be a musician. So by way of explanation, I'll start at the beginning.

My earliest memory is also my earliest musical memory. I remember sitting at my mother's feet as she played the piano. She always played tangos for some reason. Perhaps it was the fashion at the time, I don't know. The piano was an upright with worn brass pedals. And when my mother played one of her tangos she seemed to become transported to another world. Her feet rocking rhythmically between the loud and soft pedals, her arms pumping to the odd rhythms of the tango, her eyes intent upon the sheet music in front of her.

For my mother, playing the piano was the only time that I wasn't the center of her world—the only time she ignored me. So I knew that something significant—some important ritual—was being enacted here. I suppose I was being initiated into something—initiated into some sort of mystery. The mystery of music.

And so I began to aspire to the piano and would spend hours hammering away at atonal clusters in the delusion that if I persisted long enough my noise would become music. I still labor under this delusion My mother cursed me with the fine ear of a musician but the hands of a plumber. Anyway, the piano had to be sold to help us out of a financial hole, and my career as an atonal serialist was mercifully stunted. It wasn't until an uncle of mine emigrated to Canada, leaving behind an old Spanish guitar with five rusty strings that my enormous and clumsy fingers found a musical home, and I found what was to become my best friend. Where the piano had seemed incomprehensible, I was able to make music on the guitar almost instantaneously.

Melodies, chords, song structures fell at my fingertips. Somehow I could listen to a song on the radio and then make a passable attempt at playing it. It was a miracle. I spent hour after hour, day after day, month after month, just playing, rejoicing in the miracle and probably driving my parents 'round the bend.

But it was their fault in the first place. Music is an addiction, a religion, and a disease. There is no cure. No antidote. I was hooked.

There was only one radio station in England at that time—the BBC. And you could hear the Beatles and the Rolling Stones side by side with bits of Mozart, Beethoven, Glenn Miller and even the blues. This was my musical education. Its eclecticism, supplemented by my parents' record collection of Rodgers and Hammerstein , Lerner and Lowe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis. But it wasn't until the Beatles that I realized that perhaps I could make a living out of music.

The Beatles came from the same working-class background as I did. They were English, and Liverpool wasn't any fancier or more romantic than my own home town. And my guitar went from being the companion of my solitude to the means of my escape.

There's a lot been written about my life after that time so that I can't remember what's true and what isn't. I had no formal musical education. But I suppose I became successful by a combination of dumb luck, low cunning, and risk-taking born out of curiosity. I still operate in the same way. But your curiosity in music is never entirely satisfied. You could fill libraries with what I don't know about music. There's always something more to learn.

Now, musicians aren't particularly good role models in society. We really don't have a very good reputation. Philanderers, alcoholics, addicts, alimony-jumpers, tax-evaders. And I'm not just talking about rock musicians. Classical musicians have just as bad a reputation. And jazz musicians...forget it! But when you watch a musician play—when he enters that private musical world—you often see a child at play, innocent and curious, full of wonder at what can only be adequately described as a mystery—a sacred mystery even. Something deep. Something strange. Both joyous and sad. Something impossible to explain in words. I mean what could possible keep us playing scales and arpeggios hour after hour, day after day, year after year? Is it some vague promise of glory, money, or fame? Or is it something deeper?

Our instruments connect us to this mystery and a musician will maintain this sense of wonder 'til the day he or she dies. I had the privilege of spending some time with the great arranger Gil Evans in the last year of his life. He was still listening, still open to new ideas, still open to the wonder of music. Still a curious child.

So as we stand here in our robes with our diplomas, our degrees of excellence. Some are merely honorary, some diligently worked for. We have mastered the laws of harmony and the rules of counterpoint, the skills of arranging and orchestrating, of developing themes and rhythmic motifs. But do any of us really know what music is? Is it merely physics? Mathematics? The stuff of romance? Commerce? Why is it so important to us? What is its essence?

I can't even pretend to know. I've written hundreds of songs, had them published, had them in the charts. Grammys and enough written proof that I'm a bona fide, successful songwriter. Still, if somebody asks me how I write songs, I have to say, "I don't really know." I don't really know where they come from. A melody is always a gift from somewhere else. You just have to learn to be grateful and pray that you will be blessed again some other time. It's the same with the lyrics. You can't write a song without a metaphor. You can mechanically construct verses, choruses, bridges, middle eights, but without a central metaphor, you ain't got nothing.

I often wonder: where do melodies and metaphors come from? If you could buy them in a store I'd be first in the queue, believe me. I spend most of my time searching for these mysterious commodities, searching for inspiration.

Paradoxically, I'm coming to believe in the importance of silence in music. The power of silence after a phrase of music for example; the dramatic silence after the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, or the space between the notes of a Miles Davis solo. There is something very specific about a rest in music. You take your foot off the pedal and pay attention. I'm wondering whether, as musicians, the most important thing we do is merely to provide a frame for silence. I'm wondering if silence itself is perhaps the mystery at the heart of music? And is silence the most perfect music of all?

Songwriting is the only form of meditation that I know. And it is only in silence that the gifts of melody and metaphor are offered. To people in the modern world, true silence is something we rarely experience. It is almost as if we conspire to avoid it. Three minutes of silence seems like a very long time. It forces us to pay attention to ideas and emotions that we rarely make any time for. There are some people who find this awkward, or even frightening.

Silence if disturbing. It is disturbing because it is the wavelength of the soul. If we leave no space in our music—and I'm as guilty as anyone else in this regard—then we rob the sound we make of a defining context. It is often music born from anxiety to create more anxiety. It's as if we're afraid of leaving space. Great music's as much about the space between the notes as it is about the notes themselves. A bar's rest is as important and significant as the bar of demi-, semi-quavers that precedes it. What I'm trying to say here is that if ever I'm asked if I'm religious I always reply, "Yes, I'm a devout musician." Music puts me in touch with something beyond the intellect, something otherworldly, something sacred.

How is it that some music can move us to tears? Why is some music indescribably beautiful? I never tire of hearing Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings" or Faures "Pavane" or Otis Redding's "Dock of the Bay." These pieces speak to me in the only religious language I understand. They induce in me a state of deep meditation, of wonder. They make me silent.

It's very hard to talk about music in words. Words are superfluous to the abstract power of music. We can fashion words into poetry so that they are understood the way music is understood, but they only aspire to the condition where music already exists.

Music is probably the oldest religious rite. Our ancestors used melody and rhythm to co-opt the spirit world to their purposes—to try and make sense of the universe. The first priests were probably musicians. The first prayers probably songs.

So what I'm getting round to saying is that as musicians, whether we're successful, playing to thousands of people every night, or not so successful, playing in bars or small clubs, or not successful at all, just playing alone in your apartment to the cat, we are doing something that can heal souls, that can mend us when our spirits are broken. Whether you make a million dollars or not one cent, music and silence are priceless gifts, may you always possess them. May they always possess you.

Thank you.

Like Harvard, Phi Beta Kappa is older than the United States. The original chapter was founded at William and Mary in 1776. Today we celebrate your election to the Alpha and Iota chapter of Massachusetts. Founded in 1779 it is the chapter in longest continuous operation. So . . . what happened to William and Mary? Cornwallis' troops arrived.

The early history of Phi Beta Kappa gives a small measure of the impact of thoughtful people on our society. Among the fifty original members, one quarter served in the Revolutionary Army, some were elected to the Continental Congress and later to the fledgling United States Congress. John Marshall was one of the most distinguished members; he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801. Under his leadership, the Court laid out the main structural lines of government.

The founders of this country boldly created a new form of government and protected the rights of a nation's citizens as they had never been protected before. Today the thoughts and dreams of these men still shape our lives. We are all used to thinking about the way governments and political processes affect us. But we are only subliminally aware of the way that scientific exploration of the universe defines us. A profound part of our history is the expansion of the human horizon from a small fraction of the surface of the Earth to the fifteen billion light year radius of the visible universe.

As some of you know, I have spent my professional life pursuing a "modest" goal . . . to map the visible universe. We have the great fortune to be alive at the time when technological advances have just made such a daunting project possible. Of course, to be absolutely honest we map a small part of the visible universe. So far we've managed a fraction of the visible universe comparable with the fraction of the Earth covered by Rhode Island. Often people ask me, "Doesn't it make you feel insignificant to study something so large as the whole universe?" Some days it certainly does, but most of the time I feel so privileged that I don't have time to worry. Why privileged? Because I have been able to spend my life compelled by my own curiosity, a curiosity which drives me to continue asking questions.

We human beings are grand because we have the power to understand. We ask questions about nature and most remarkably, we can construct mathematical models which explain how it works. Other creatures may think, communicate, even wonder; but we are unique in our ability to understand.

In order to understand, the scientist makes a model --- a picture --- an abstraction which contains (hopefully) all of the important properties of the natural phenomenon. The more advanced the science, the more complex the picture. Often the picture is cast in mathematical language. Whatever the description, the scientist "sees" the picture and views it from many perspectives in the mind's eye. The scientist sees the atom, the cell, the universe . . . all brought to his or her own size. I once visited a researcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer Research Institute. To describe his research he pulled out a piece of paper and drew a blobby thing with a nucleus. "This is a cell" he said and proceeded with the details. "And tell me what you do." I turned the paper over, drew a blobby thing with a nucleus, and without hesitation, pronounced, "This is a galaxy". This abstraction gives a sense of possession of worlds far removed from normal everyday experience. When I draw a map of a piece of the universe, it always fits on an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper. These journeys of the imagination must end by predicting or explaining the observable natural world.

Like the artist or composer, the scientist is a master of abstraction. In the process of discovery or understanding, the scientist finds the most powerful model by painstakingly exploring its correspondence with nature. Less restricted by the demand that their pictures match nature, the artist, the writer and the composer all construct pictures of the world they see. The artist makes preliminary sketches; a composer tries different sequences and combinations of notes to refine the picture and to test how elements work to convey the message. At the end of the process, the creative work is a part of the artist. A scientific discovery is a part of the scientist.

A scientist recognizes patterns in nature. Individual scientists have distinctive styles in approaching these puzzles. First there is only the vague outline . . . a feeling based on experience that there is something which can be understood. Then a scientist applies every tool at his or her disposal to make connections which were not recognized before. And then, sometimes . . . there is the awesome experience of discovery. It is a high you never forget and one you want to share.

In the early 1970's, when I first started to work in cosmology, there was very little data. Three-dimensional maps of the very nearby universe contained about a thousand of the ten or hundred billion galaxies in the visible universe. Pictures of large areas of the sky along with these limited maps led people to a simple idea about the general appearance of the universe today. We knew that galaxies like our own Milky Way often cluster together in systems containing as many as 1000 galaxies in a region a few million light years across, and these clusters sometimes form aggregates a few tens of millions of light years across, and most thought that was all.

First indications that there might be even large patterns in the universe came in 1981 when Bob Kirshner and his colleagues discovered a region they called the void in Boötes, a region 200 million light years across where there are few if any galaxies. Well, regions like this one were not supposed to exist. But the discovery raised the question, and in 1985 John Huchra and I decided to have a look. We actually expected to show that large patterns were very rare if they existed at all; not to find them. But fortunately, our strategy was well-designed and nature was not subtle. The first slice of the universe we mapped reveals a striking and surprising pattern. Galaxies appear on thin surfaces around vast dark regions, like soap bubbles, 200 million light years across. This enormous pattern is part of me.

Often the scientific questions we ask are deceptively simple. How do trees know which way is up? How does our activity on the Earth affect the climate? What does the universe look like? How did it get to be this way and how do we fit into the picture? None of these questions have easy answers. We don't know the answers, but we never stop asking the questions. In each case we have taken steps toward the answer. Each investigator builds on the steps taken before, sometimes with new tools, and occasionally with the special insight which leads to a leap in understanding.

Children might ask similar questions, and often do, They ask out of a natural curiosity about the world around them. They just want to know. Children instinctively recognize the value of knowing just for the sake of knowing.

The best scientists are those who retain the somewhat naive curiosity of a child. They see the world with a special eye --- an eye which seeks to understand. The extraordinary artistry of nature is not enough by itself. It has to be understood and in that understanding is an even greater beauty. James Baldwin's eloquent description of the purpose of art applies equally well to science. "The purpose of art (also science) is to lay bare the questions which have been hidden by the answers."

The vision of a scientist complements the vision of the artist. The artist communicates a personal view; the scientist seeks simple models which explain and predict the behavior of nature. The spare elegance of Newton's law of gravity explains the bouncing ball, the launch of a rocket, motions in the solar system, and the motions of galaxies like the Milky Way on scales of hundreds of millions of light years. This economy of being able to understand so much with so few rules is a triumph of the human mind. One of the great mysteries of nature is that we can find these laws. The understanding enriches our lives through the sheer pleasure of knowing.

Our scientific insight also underlies our technological achievements. Our technology, in turn, enables further understanding. During my career, technological advances have changed cosmology from a data-poor to a data-rich field. The technology in your videocamera, the fiber optics important for communications devices and for minimum access surgery, the new materials and computer controlled servo-systems which have changed manufacturing of a broad array of products, have also advanced our ability to explore the universe. The construction and instrumentation of the new generation of very large --- 6.5 to 10 meter --- telescopes on the ground depend on these technological advances among others. With these telescopes we will be able to observe the distant, younger universe. The universe is a time machine. When we look out in space to a distance of, say, a few billion light years, we see the universe as it was a few billion years ago. The history of the universe is there for us to see! During the last twenty years we have made substantial progress in learning what the universe looks like today; during the next twenty we will begin to see directly how the enormous patterns came to be.

It is easier to attach a dollar value to technological achievements than to the fundamental quest for an understanding of nature, and many people busy themselves trying to justify science by doing just that. But attaching a monetary value to our sense of wonder is as meaningless as attaching a price to being human. Without our sense of wonder, much of our joy and excitement, many of our triumphs would be lost. Our curiosity combined with our uncanny ability to find explanations defines us. Again an artist, Rene Magritte, expressed the feeling, "Each thing we see hides something else we want to see". His paintings show us the irony of our vision by making us look at images we can never see in nature. He makes us wonder what universe he visited to find men instead of raindrops falling from the sky.

My own field, cosmology, demonstrates this age-old connection between our sense of wonder and who we are. Every civilization we know wondered about the nature of the universe, and we admire that curiosity. The ancient Greeks wondered whether the universe was comfortably finite in extent . . . or was it infinite, extending on and on forever. Finite or infinite, the universe has no center, an idea as strangely fascinating as a painting by Magritte.

Michael Vogeley, who did his Ph.D. with me a couple of years ago, reminisces: "I vividly remember an evening when I was in high school, sitting on the porch with a friend of mine, wondering out loud about where the universe ends. And I remember thinking how much I admired the few people both capable and privileged enough to actually look for the answer. Cosmologists, I discovered they were called. You mean that you can get a JOB doing that?" He is now looking for those answers.

Today we have a model. The Big Bang model is our picture of the way the universe evolves. This model makes the simple statement that the early universe was hot and dense. Now it's less so because it has been expanding --- stretching for more than ten billion years. The universe may be finite or it may be infinite in extent. The model tells us what to measure to find out which it is. The model says . . . go measure how much matter there is in every cubic centimeter of the universe. Easier said than done.

Nature has played an unkind trick on those who try to figure out how much stuff the universe contains. We explore the universe by detecting ancient photons, light from galaxies which has traveled to us for hundreds of millions --- even billions --- of years without hitting anything until it ends its journey in our detectors. All the information we obtain about the present universe and its history is carried by these ancient photons. But most, ninety percent or perhaps even ninety-nine percent of the matter is dark. It doesn't emit light detectable at any wavelength. Thus we don't know what the matter is or where it is. We can detect it only from the motions it causes in the objects we do see.

If the universe is dense enough . . . if there is enough matter to halt the expansion, the universe is finite. In this case we started with a bang, and in some tens of billion of years or so we will end with one. The universe will have a dense hot end. If the density of matter in the universe is low, the expansion will continue forever to a very dilute, very cold, dark end. The data point to this end (although this field of science is rarely characterized by great certainty). This conclusion leaves us a bit queasy because it means that this history --- our history --- is the only one; the universe will not have another chance to begin again in the future.

One of the fascinating aspects of this rather simple perception of the universe based on Einstein's theory of relativity is the way images connected with it pervade literature and art. For example, ee cummings wrote "lenses extend unwish into curving wherewhen until unwish returns on its unself". Obviously he liked a finite universe. T. S. Eliot wrote, "This is the way the world ends . . . this is the way the world ends . . . this is the way the world ends . . . not with a bang but a whimper", an infinite universe with a cold dark end. Shakespeare, who said everything about everything, thought about the universe. He wrote, "Now entertain conjecture of time, when creeping murmur and pouring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe". How similar to T. S. Eliot's imagery 400 years later. More recently, the New Yorker, the ultimate cultural arbiter, published a cartoon showing two guys at a bar. One says to the other, "I think the universe expands one day, shrinks the next, remains static for a week, and then it begins all over again".

Today those of us who work in this field believe that we can understand the history of the universe and define its extent. Warnings about limits to our ability to understand echo through the ages. For example, Chuang Tsu, the ancient Chinese philosopher warned, "Life has a limit, but knowledge is without limit. For the limited to pursue the unlimited is futile. To know this and still pursue knowledge is even more futile". Douglas Adams, the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cautioned, "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another which states that this has already happened".

I am not about to heed these warnings. I want to know and I believe we can know the answers. I have the perhaps naive belief that the universe is comprehensible and what we don't manage to understand during my career, I have confidence that your generation and those after you will. Science is driven not only by the curiosity of those who explore today but also by their confidence that others like you will succeed where they have failed. Science is intrinsically forward looking. What we do not understand we will.

Our store of imagination and wonder for the future is in our children. But in this, the richest country in the world, one third of our children will spend at least a year in poverty before the age of 16. This situation is far from typical of other industrialized nations. With this unconscionable choice of priorities we are wasting our greatest resource for the future of all creative disciplines.

Hunger, inadequate medical care, poor housing, and inferior schools are the enemies of wonder. Doors closed for so many of our innately curious children cannot easily be opened. It is easier and less expensive in the long run to prevent a loss of imagination than to try to restore that loss.

A hundred years ago, members of Phi Beta Kappa debated "Whether a wise State hath any Interest nearer at Heart than the Education of the Youth". Today, many would like to argue this question once again. For me there is no debate. My hope is that all of you here will join in protecting, nurturing, and fulfilling the sense of wonder in all of our children.

In a sensible world I would now congratulate the Class of 1995 and sit down without further comment. I am sure the Class of 1995 wishes I would do so. Unfortunately for the Class of 1995 we do not live in a sensible world.

We live in a world far more slavish in its obedience to ancient custom than we like to admit. And ancient commencement-day custom demands that somebody stand up here and harangue the poor graduates until they beg for mercy. The ancient rule has been: make them suffer. I still remember the agony of my own graduation at The John Hopkins University.

They had imported some heat from the Sahara Desert especially for the occasion, and the commencement orator spoke for two and a half days. That was in 1947.

Luckily, the forces of mercy have made big gains since then. The authorities of Connecticut College have suggested that for me to speak longer than 20 minutes would be regarded as cruel and inhuman punishment and that if I go as long as 30 minutes several strong men will mount this platform and forcibly remove me. But if I can finish in 15 minutes - 15 minutes! - they will let me stay for lunch. They know their man, ladies and gentleman. When I smell a free lunch, I go for it.

So if I can do this right, you’ll see the back of me before we get to minute 16. This will not be easy. Condensing a graduation speech into 15 minutes is like trying to squeeze a Wagnerian opera into a telephone booth. To do it I had to strip away all the frills. This means you don’t even get any warm-up jokes. So those of you who came just for the jokes might as well leave now.

All right, let’s plunge right ahead into the dull part. That’s the part where the commencement speaker tells the graduates to go forth into the world, then gives advice on what to do when they get out there. This is a ridiculous waste of time. The graduates never take the advice, as I have learned from long experience. The best advice I can give anybody about going out into the world is this: Don’t do it. I have been out there. It is a mess.

I have been giving graduates this advice ever since 1967 when I spoke to a batch of them over at Bennington. That was 28 years ago. Some of your parent were probably graduating there that day and went on to ignore my advice.

Thanks to the genius of my generation, I told them, it was a pretty good world out there - they went forth into it, they would mess it up. So I urged them not to go.

I might as well have been shouting down a rain barrel. They didn’t listen. They went forth anyhow. And look what happened. Within a year Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were murdered. Then Nixon took us all to The Watergate. Draft riots. Defeat in Vietnam. John Lennon killed. Ronald Reagan and his trillion-dollar deficit.

Over the years I spoke to many graduating classes, always pleading with them: Whatever you do, do not go forth.

Nobody listened. They kept right on going forth anyhow. And look what we have today: Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton.

So I will not waste my breath today pleading with you not to go forth. Instead I limit myself to a simple plea: When you get out there in the world try not to make it any worse than it already is. I thought it might help to give you a list of the hundred most important things you can do to avoid making the world any worse. Since I’m shooting for 15 minutes, however, there is no time to give you all 100. You will have to make do with 10. Short as the public attention span is these days, nobody could remember 100 anyhow. Even 10 may be asking too much.

You remember the old joke about how television news would have reported the story of the Ten Commandments: “God today issued 10 commandments, three of which are…”

He is my list: 10 things to help you avoid making the world worse than it already is.

One: Bend down once in a while and smell a flower.

Two: Don’t go around in clothes that talk. There is already too much talk in the world. We’ve got so many talking people there’s hardly anybody left to listen. With radio and television and telephones we’ve got talking furniture. With bumper stickers we’ve got talking cars. Talking clothes just add to the uproar. If you simply cannot resist being an incompetent klutz, don’t boast about it by wearing a tee shirt that says ‘underachiever and proud of it.’ Being dumb is not the worst thing in the world, but letting your clothes shout it out loud depresses the neighbors and embarrasses your parents.

Point three follows from point two, and it’s this: Listen once in a while. It’s amazing what you can hear. On a hot summer day in the country you can hear the corn growing, the crack of a tin roof buckling under the power of the sun. In a real old-fashioned parlor silence so deep you can hear the dust settling on the velveteen settee, you might hear the footsteps of something sinister gaining on you, or a heart-stoppingly beautiful phrase from Mozart you haven’t heard since childhood, or the voice of somebody - now gone - whom you loved. Or sometime when you’re talking up a storm so brilliant, so charming that you can hardly believe how wonderful you are, pause just a moment and listen to yourself. It’s good for the soul to hear yourself as others hear you, and next time maybe, just maybe, you will not talk so much, so loudly, so brilliantly, so charmingly, so utterly shamefully foolishly.

Point four: Sleep in the nude. In an age when people don’t even get dressed to go to the theater anymore, it’s silly getting dressed up to go to bed. What’s more, now that you can no longer smoke, drink gin or eat bacon and eggs without somebody trying to make you feel ashamed of yourself, sleeping in the nude is one deliciously sinful pleasure you can commit without being caught by the Puritan police squads that patrol the nation.

Point five: Turn off the TV once or twice a month and pick up a book. It will ease your blood pressure. It might even wake up your mind, but if it puts you to sleep you’re still a winner. Better to sleep than have to watch that endless parade of body bags the local news channel marches through your parlor.

Six: Don’t take your gun to town. Don’t even leave it home unless you lock all your bullets in a safe deposit box in a faraway bank. The surest way to get shot is not to drop by the nearest convenience store for a bottle of milk at midnight, but to keep a loaded pistol in you own house. What about your constitutional right to bear arms, you say. I would simply point out that you don’t have to exercise a constitutional right just because you have it. You have the constitutional right to run for president of the United States, abut most people have too much sense to insist on exercising it.

Seven: Learn to fear the automobile. It is not the trillion-dollar deficit that will finally destroy America. It is the automobile. Congressional studies of future highway needs are terrifying. A typical projection shows that when your generation is middle-aged, Interstate 95 between Miami and Fort Lauderdale will have to be 22 lanes wide to avert total paralysis of south Florida. Imagine an entire country covered with asphalt. My grandfather’s generation shot horses. Yours had better learn to shoot automobiles.

Eight: Have some children. Children add texture to your life. They will save you from turning into old fogies before you’re middle-aged. They will teach you humility. When old age overtakes you, as it inevitably will I’m sorry to say, having a few children will provide you with people who will feel guilty when they’re accused of being ungrateful for all you’ve done for them. It’s almost impossible nowadays to find anybody who will feel guilty about anything, including mass murder. When you reach the golden years, your best bet is children, the ingrates.

Nine: Get married. I know you don’t want to hear this, but getting married will give you a lot more satisfaction in the long run than your BMW. It provides a standard set of parent for your children and gives you that second income you will need when it’s time to send those children to Connecticut College. What’s more, without marriage you will have practically no material at all to work with when you decide to write a book or hire a psychiatrist.

When you get married, whatever you do, do not ask a lawyer to draw up a marriage contract spelling out how your lives will be divvied up when you get divorced. It’s hard enough making a marriage work without having a blueprint for its destruction drawn up before you go to the altar. Speaking of lawyers brings me to point nine and a half, which is: Avoid lawyers unless you have nothing to do with the rest of your life but kill time.

And finally, point 10: Smile. You’re one of the luckiest people in the world. You’re living in America. Enjoy it. I feel obliged to give you this banal advice because, although I’ve lived through the Great Depression, World War II, terrible wars in Korea and Vietnam, and half a century of cold war, I have never seen a time when there were so many Americans so angry or so mean-spirited or so sour about the country as there are today.

Anger has become the national habit. You see it on the sullen faces of fashion models scowling out of magazines. it pours out of the radio. Washington television hams snarl and shout at each other on television. Ordinary people abuse politicians and their wives with shockingly coarse insults. Rudeness has become an acceptable way of announcing you are sick and tired of it all and are not going to take it anymore. Vile speech is justified on the same ground and is inescapable.

America is angry at Washington, angry at the press, angry at immigrants, angry at television, angry at traffic, angry at people who are well off and angry at people who are poor, angry at blacks and angry at whites. The old are angry at the young, the young angry at the old. Suburbs are angry at the cities, cities are angry at the suburbs. Rustic America is angry at both whenever urban and suburban invaders threaten the rustic sense of having escaped from God’s angry land. A complete catalog of the varieties of bile poisoning the American soul would fill a library. The question is: why? Why has anger become the common response to the inevitable ups and down of nation life? The question is baffling not just because the American habit even in the worst of times has traditionally been mindless optimism, but also because there is so little for Americans to be angry about nowadays. We are the planet’s undisputed super power. For the first time in 60 years we enjoy something very much like real peace. We are by all odds the wealthiest nation on earth, though admittedly our vast treasure is not evenly shared.

Forgive me the geezer’s sin of talking about “the bad old days,” but the country is still full of people who remember when 35 dollars a week was considered a living wage for a whole family. People whine about being overtaxed, yet in the 1950s the top income-tax rate was 91 percent, universal military service was the law of the land, and racial segregation was legally enforced in large parts of the country.

So what explains the fury and dyspepsia? I suspect it’s the famous American ignorance of history. People who know nothing of even the most recent past are easily gulled by slick operators who prosper by exploiting the ignorant. Among these rascals are our politicians. Politicians flourish by sowing discontent. They triumph by churning discontent into anger. Press, television and radio also have a big financial stake in keeping the county boiling mad.

Good news, as you know, does not sell papers or keep millions glued to radios and TV screens.

So when you get out there in the world, ladies and gentlemen, you’re going to find yourself surrounded by shouting, red-in-the-face, stomping-mad politicians, radio yakmeisters and, yes sad to say, newspaper columnists, telling you ‘you never had it so bad’ and otherwise trying to spoil your day.

When they come at you with that , ladies and gentlemen, give them a wink and a smile and a good view of your departing back. And as you stroll away, bend down to smell a flower.

Now it seems I have run past the 15-minute limit and will have to buy my own lunch. That’s life Class of 1995. No free lunch.

My sermon is done.

Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen,

One evening not long ago I was sitting in an outdoor restaurant by the water. My chair was almost identical to the chairs they have in restaurants by the Vltava River in Prague. They were playing the same rock music they play in most Czech restaurants. I saw advertisements I’m familiar with back home. Above all, I was surrounded by young people who were similarly dressed, who drank familiar-looking drinks, and who behaved as casually as their contemporaries in Prague. Only their complexion and their facial features were different - for I was in Singapore.

I sat there thinking about this and again - for the umpteenth time - I realized an almost banal truth: that we now live in a single global civilization. The identity of this civilization does not lie merely in similar forms of dress, or similar drinks, or in the constant buzz of the same commercial music all around the world, or even in international advertising. It lies in something deeper: thanks to the modern idea of constant progress, with its inherent expansionism, and to the rapid evolution of science that comes directly from it, our planet has, for the first time in the long history of the human race, been covered in the space of a very few decades by a single civilization - one that is essentially technological.

The world is now enmeshed in webs of telecommunication networks consisting of millions of tiny threads, or capillaries, that not only transmit information of all kinds at lightning speed, but also convey integrated models of social, political and economic behavior. They are conduits for legal norms, as well as for billions and billions of dollars crisscrossing the world while remaining invisible even to those who deal directly with them.

The life of the human race is completely interconnected not only in the informational sense, but in the causal sense as well. Anecdotally, I could illustrate this by reminding you - since I’ve already mentioned Singapore - that today all it takes is a single shady transaction initiated by a single devious bank clerk in Singapore to bring down a bank on the other side of the world. Thanks to the accomplishments of this civilization, practically all of us know what checks, bonds, bills of exchange, and stocks are. We are familiar with CNN and Chernobyl, and we know who the Rolling Stones, or Nelson Mandela, or Salman Rushdie are. More than that, the capillaries that have so radically integrated this civilization also convey information about certain modes of human co-existence that have proven their worth, like democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, the laws of the market-place. Such information flows around the world and, in varying degrees, takes root in different places.

In modern times this global civilization emerged in the territory occupied by European and ultimately by Euro-American culture. Historically, it evolved from a combination of traditions - classical, Judaic and Christian. In theory, at least, it gives people not only the capacity for worldwide communication, but also a coordinated means of defending themselves against many common dangers. It can also, in an unprecedented way, make our life on this earth easier and open us up to hitherto unexplored horizons in our knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in.

And yet there is something not quite right about it.

Allow me to use this ceremonial gathering for a brief meditation on a subject which I have dwelt upon a great deal, and which I often bring up on occasions resembling this one. I want to focus today on the source of the dangers that threaten humanity in spite of this global civilization, and often directly because of it. Above all, I would like to speak about the ways in which these dangers can be confronted.

Many of the great problems we face today, as far as I understand them, have their origin in the fact that this global civilization, though in evidence everywhere, is no more than a thin veneer over the sum total of human awareness, if I may put it that way. This civilization is immensely fresh, young, new, and fragile, and the human spirit has accepted it with dizzying alacrity, without itself changing in any essential way. Humanity has gradually, and in very diverse ways, shaped our habits of mind, our relationship to the world, our models of behavior and the values we accept and recognize. In essence, this new, single epidermis of world civilization merely covers or conceals the immense variety of cultures, of peoples, of religious worlds, of historical traditions and historically formed attitudes, all of which in a sense lie “beneath” it. At the same time, even as the veneer of world civilization expands, this “underside” of humanity, this hidden dimension of it, demands more and more clearly to be heard and to be granted a right to life.

And thus, while the world as a whole increasingly accepts the new habits of global civilization, another contradictory process is taking place: ancient traditions are reviving, different religions and cultures are awakening to new ways of being, seeking new room to exist, and struggling with growing fervor to realize what is unique to them and what makes them different from others. Ultimately they seek to give their individuality a political expression.

It is often said that in our time, every valley cries out for its own independence or will even fight for it. Many nations, or parts of them at least, are struggling against modern civilization or its main proponents for the right to worship their ancient gods and obey the ancient divine injunctions. They carry on their struggle using weapons provided by the very civilization they oppose. They employ radar, computers, lasers, nerve gases, and perhaps, in the future, even nuclear weapons - all products of the world of modern civilization. In contrast with these technological inventions, other products of this civilization - like democracy or the idea of human rights - are not accepted in many places in the world because they are deemed to be hostile to local traditions.

In other words: the Euro-American world has equipped other parts of the globe with instruments that not only could effectively destroy the enlightened values which, among other things, made possible the invention of precisely these instruments, but which could well cripple the capacity of people to live together on this earth.

What follows from all of this?

It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a clear challenge not only to the Euro-American world but to our present-day civilization as a whole. It is a challenge to this civilization to start understanding itself as a multi-cultural and a multi-polar civilization, whose meaning lies not in undermining the individuality of different spheres of culture and civilization but in allowing them to be more completely themselves. This will only be possible, even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code of mutual co-existence, a kind of common minimum we can all share, one that will enable us to go on living side by side. Yet such a code won’t stand a chance if it is merely the product of a few who then proceed to force it on the rest. It must be an expression of the authentic will of everyone, growing out of the genuine spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our common, global civilization. If it is merely disseminated through the capillaries of the skin, the way Coca-cola ads are - as a commodity offered by some to others - such a code can hardly be expected to take hold in any profound or universal way.

But is humanity capable of such an undertaking? Is it not a hopelessly utopian idea? Haven’t we so lost control of our destiny that we are condemned to gradual extinction in ever harsher high-tech clashes between cultures, because of our fatal inability to cooperate-operate in the face of impending catastrophes, be they ecological, social, or demographic, or of dangers generated by the state of our civilization as such?

I don’t know.

But I have not lost hope.

I have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and again that, lying dormant in the deepest roots of most, if not all, cultures there is an essential similarity, something that could be made - if the will to do so existed - a genuinely unifying starting point for that new code of human co-existence that would be firmly anchored in the great diversity of human traditions.

Don’t we find somewhere in the foundations of most religions and cultures, though they may take a thousand and one distinct forms, common elements such as respect for what transcends us, whether we mean the mystery of being, or a moral order that stands above us; respect for our neighbors, for our families, for certain natural authorities; respect for human dignity and for nature: a sense of solidarity and benevolence towards guests who come with good intentions?

Isn’t the common, ancient origin or human roots of our diverse spiritualities, each of which is merely another kind of human understanding of the same reality, the thing that can genuinely bring people of different cultures together?

And aren’t the basic commandments of this archetypal spirituality in harmony with what even an unreligious person - without knowing exactly why - may consider proper and meaningful?

Naturally, I am not suggesting that modern people be compelled to worship ancient deities and accept rituals they have long since abandoned. I am suggesting something quite different: we must come to understand the deep mutual connection or kinship between the various forms of our spirituality. We must recollect our original spiritual and moral substance, which grew out of the same essential experience of humanity. I believe that this is the only way to achieve a genuine renewal of our sense of responsibility for ourselves and for the world. And at the same time, it is the only way to achieve a deeper understanding among cultures that will enable them to work together in a truly ecumenical way to create a new order for the world.

The veneer of global civilization that envelops the modern world and the consciousness of humanity, as we all know, has a dual nature, bringing into question, at every step of the way, the very values it is based upon, or which it propagates. The thousands of marvelous achievements of this civilization that work for us so well and enrich us can equally impoverish, diminish, and destroy our lives, and frequently do. Instead of serving people, many of these creations enslave them. Instead of helping people to develop their identities, they take them away. Almost every invention or discovery - from the splitting of the atom and the discovery of DNA to television and the computer - can be turned against us and used to our detriment. How much easier it is today than it was during the First World War to destroy an entire metropolis in a single air-raid. And how much easier would it be today, in the era of television, for a madman like Hitler or Stalin to pervert the spirit of a whole nation. When have people ever had the power we now possess to alter the climate of the planet or deplete its mineral resources or the wealth of its fauna and flora in the space of a few short decades? And how much more destructive potential do terrorists have at their disposal today than at the beginning of this century.

In our era, it would seem that one part of the human brain, the rational part which has made all these morally neutral discoveries, has undergone exceptional development, while the other part, which should be alert to ensure that these discoveries really serve humanity and will not destroy it, has lagged behind catastrophically.

Yes, regardless of where I begin my thinking about the problems facing our civilization, I always return to the theme of human responsibility, which seems incapable of keeping pace with civilization and preventing it from turning against the human race. It’s as though the world has simply become too much for us to deal with.

There is no way back. Only a dreamer can believe that the solution lies in curtailing the progress of civilization in some way or other. The main task in the coming era is something else: a radical renewal of our sense of responsibility. Our conscience must catch up to our reason, otherwise we are lost.

It is my profound belief that there is only one way to achieve this: we must divest ourselves of our egotistical anthroponcentrism, our habit of seeing ourselves as masters of the universe who can do whatever occurs to us. We must discover a new respect for what transcends us: for the universe, for the earth, for nature, for life, and for reality. Our respect for other people, for other nations and for other cultures, can only grow from a humble respect for the cosmic order and from an awareness that we are a part of it, that we share in it and that nothing of what we do is lost, but rather becomes part of the eternal memory of being, where it is judged.

A better alternative of the future of humanity, therefore, clearly lies in imbuing our civilization with a spiritual dimension. It’s not just a matter of understanding its multi-cultural nature and finding inspiration for the creation of a new world order in the common roots of all cultures. It is also essential that the Euro-American cultural sphere - the one which created this civilization and taught humanity its destructive pride - now return to its own spiritual roots and become an example to the rest of the world in the search for a new humility.

General observations of this type are certainly not difficult to make nor are they new or revolutionary. Modern people are masters at describing the crisis and the misery of the world which we shape, and for which we are responsible. We are much less adept at putting things right.

So what specifically is to be done?

I do not believe in some universal key or panacea. I am not an advocate of what Karl Popper called “holistic social engineering”, particularly because I had to live most of my adult life in circumstances that resulted from an attempt to create a holistic Marxist utopia. I know more than enough, therefore, about efforts of this kind.

This does not relieve me, however, of the responsibility to think of ways to make the world better.

It will certainly not be easy to awaken in people a new sense of responsibility for the world, an ability to conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever, and to be held answerable for its condition one day. Who knows how many horrific cataclysms humanity may have to go through before such a sense of responsibility is generally accepted. But this does not mean that those who wish to work for it cannot begin at once. It is a great task for teachers, educators, intellectuals, the clergy, artists, entrepreneurs, journalists, people active in all forms of public life.

Above all it is a task for politicians.

Even in the most democratic of conditions, politicians have immense influence, perhaps more than they themselves realize. This influence does not lie in their actual mandates, which in any case are considerably limited. It lies in something else: in the spontaneous impact their charisma has on the public.

The main task of the present generation of politicians is not, I think to ingratiate themselves with the public through the decisions they take or their smiles on television. It is not to go on winning elections and ensuring themselves a place in the sun till the end of their days. Their role is something quite different: to assume their share of responsibility for the long-range prospects of our world and thus to set an example for the public in whose sight they work. Their responsibility is to think ahead boldly, not to fear the disfavor of the crowd, to imbue their actions with a spiritual dimension (which of course is not the same thing as ostentatious attendance at religious services), to explain again and again - both to the public and to their colleagues - that politics must do far more than reflect the interests of particular groups or lobbies. After all, politics is a matter of servicing the community, which means that it is morality in practice, And how better to serve the community and practice morality than by seeking in the midst of the global (and globally threatened) civilization their own global political responsibility: that is, their responsibility for the very survival of the human race?

I don’t believe that a politician who sets out on this risky path will inevitably jeopardize his or her political survival. This is a wrongheaded notion which assumes that the citizen is a fool and that political success depends on playing to this folly. That is not the way it is. A conscience slumbers in every human being, something divine. And that is what we have to put our trust in.

Ladies and gentlemen, I find myself at perhaps the most famous university in the most powerful country in the world. With your permission, I will say a few words on the subject of the politics of a great power.

It is obvious that those who have the greatest power and influence also bear the greatest responsibility. Like it or not, the United States of America now bears probably the greatest responsibility for the direction our world will take. The United States, therefore, should reflect most deeply on this responsibility.

Isolationism has never paid off for the United States. Had it entered the First World War earlier, perhaps it would not have had to pay with anything like the casualties it actually incurred.

The same is true of the Second World War: when Hitler was getting ready to invade Czechoslovakia, and in so doing finally exposing the lack of courage on the part of the western democracies, your president wrote a letter to the Czechoslovak President imploring him to come to some agreement with Hitler. Had he not deceived himself and the whole world into believing that an agreement could be made with this madman, had he instead shown a few teeth, perhaps the Second World War need not have happened, and tens of thousands of young Americans need not have died fighting in it.

Likewise, just before the end of that war, had your President, who was otherwise an outstanding man, said a clear “no” to Stalin’s decision to divide the world, perhaps the Cold War, which cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars, need not have happened either.

I beg you: do not repeat these mistakes! You yourselves have always paid a heavy price for them! There is simply no escaping the responsibility you have as the most powerful country in the world.

There is far more at stake here than simply standing up to those who would like once again to divide the world into spheres of interest, or subjugate others who are different from them, and weaker. What is now at stake is saving the human race. In other words, it’s a question of what I’ve already talked about: of understanding modern civilization as a multi-cultural and multi-polar civilization, of turning our attention to the original spiritual sources of human culture and above all, of our own culture, of drawing from these sources the strength for a courageous and magnanimous creation of a new order for the world.

Not long ago I was at a gala dinner to mark an important anniversary. There were fifty Heads of State present, perhaps more, who came to honor the heroes and victims of the greatest war in human history. This was not a political conference, but the kind of social event that is meant principally to show hospitality and respect to the invited guests. When the seating plan was given out, I discovered to my surprise that those sitting at the table next to mine were not identified simply as representatives of a particular state, as was the case with all the other tables; they were referred to as “permanent members of the UN Security Council and the G7.” I had mixed feeling about this. On the one hand, I thought how marvelous that the richest and most powerful of this world see each other often and even at this dinner, can talk informally and get to know each other better. On the other hand, a slight chill went down my spine, for I could not help observing that one table had been singled out as being special and particularly important. It was a table for the big powers. Somewhat perversely, I began to imagine that the people sitting at it were, along with their Russian caviar, dividing the rest of us up among themselves, without asking our opinion. Perhaps all this is merely the whimsy of a former and perhaps future playwright. But I wanted to express it here. For one simple reason: to emphasize the terrible gap that exists between the responsibility of the great powers and their hubris. The architect of that seating arrangement - I should think it was none of the attending Presidents - was not guided by a sense of responsibility for the world, but by the banal pride of the powerful.

But pride is precisely what will lead the world to hell. I am suggesting an alternative: humbly accepting our responsibility for the world.

There is one great opportunity in the matter of co-existence between nations and spheres of civilization, culture and religion that should be grasped and exploited to the limit. This is the appearance of supranational or regional communities. By now, there are many such communities in the world, with diverse characteristics and differing degrees of integration. I believe in this approach. I believe in the importance of organisms that lie somewhere between nation states and a world community, organisms that can be an important medium of global communication and cooperation-operation. I believe that this trend towards integration in a world where - as I’ve said - every valley longs for independence, must be given the greatest possible support.

These organisms, however, must not be an expression of integration merely for the sake of integration. They must be one of the many instruments enabling each region, each nation, to be both itself and capable of cooperation-operation with others. That is, they must be one of the instruments enabling countries and peoples who are close to each other geographically, ethnically, culturally and economically and who have common security interest, to form associations and better communicate with each other and with the rest of the world. At the same time, all such regional communities must rid themselves of fear that other like communities are directed against them. Regional groupings in areas that have common tradition and a common political culture ought to be a natural part of the complex political architecture of the world. Co-operation between such regions ought to be a natural component of cooperation-operation on a world-wide scale. As long as the broadening of NATO membership to include countries who feel culturally and politically a part of the region the Alliance was created to defend is seen by Russia, for example, as an anti-Russian undertaking, it will be a sign that Russia has not yet understood the challenge of this era.

The most important world organization is the United Nations. I think that the fiftieth anniversary of its birth could be an occasion to reflect on how to infuse it with a new ethos, a new strength, and a new meaning, and make it the truly most important arena of good cooperation-operation among all cultures that make up our planetary civilization.

But neither the strengthening of regional structures nor the strengthening of the UN will save the world if both processes are not informed by that renewed spiritual charge which I see as the only hope that the human race will survive another millennium.

I have touched on what I think politicians should do.

There is, however, one more force that has at least as much, if not more, influence on the general state of mind as politicians do.

That force is the mass media.

Only when fate sent me into the realm of high politics did I become fully aware of the media’s double-edged power. Their dual impact is not a specialty of the media. It is merely a part, or an expression of the dual nature of today’s civilization of which I have already spoken.

Thanks to television the whole world discovered, in the course of an evening, that there is a country called Rwanda where people are suffering beyond belief. Thanks to television it is possible to do at least a little to help those who are suffering. Thanks to television the whole world, in the course of a few seconds, was shocked and horrified about what happened in Oklahoma City and, at the same time, understood it as a great warning for all. Thanks to television the whole world knows that there exists an internationally recognized country called Bosnia and Herzegovina and that from the moment it recognized this country, the international community has tried unsuccessfully to divide it into grotesque mini-states according to the wishes of warlords who have never been recognized by anyone as anyone’s legitimate representatives.

That is the wonderful side of today’s mass media, or rather, of those who gather the news. Humanity’s thanks belong to all those courageous reporters who voluntarily risk their lives wherever something evil is happening, in order to arouse the conscience of the world.

There is, however, another, less wonderful, aspect of television, one that merely revels in the horrors of the world or, unforgivably, makes them commonplace, or compels politicians to become first of all television stars. But where is it written that someone who is good on television is necessarily also a good politician? I never fail to be astonished at how much I am at the mercy of television directors and editors, at how my public image depends far more on them than it does on myself, at how important it is to smile appropriately on television, or choose the right tie; at how television forces me to express my thoughts as sparely as possible, in witticisms, slogans or sound bites; at how easily my television image can be made to seem different from the real me. I am astonished by this and at the same time, I fear it serves no good purpose. I know politicians who have learned to see themselves only as the television camera does. Television has thus expropriated their personalities, and made them into something like television shadows of their former selves. I sometimes wonder whether they even sleep in a way that will look good on television.

I am not outraged with television or the press for distorting what I say or ignoring it, or editing me to appear like some strange monster. I am not angry with the media when I see that a politician’s rise or fall often depends more on them than on the politician concerned. What interests me is something else: the responsibility of those who have the mass media in their hands. They too bear responsibility for the world, and for the future of humanity. Just as the splitting of the atom can immensely enrich humanity in a thousand and one ways and, at the same time, can also threaten it with destruction, so television can have both good and evil consequences. Quickly, suggestively and to an unprecedented degree, it can disseminate the spirit of understanding, humanity, human solidarity and spirituality, or it can stupefy whole nations and continents. And just as our use of atomic energy depends solely on our sense of responsibility, so the proper use of television’s power to enter practically every house hold and every human mind depends on our sense of responsibility as well.

Whether our world is to be saved from everything that threatens it today depends above all on whether human beings come to their senses, whether they understand the degree of their responsibility and discover a new relationship to the very miracle of being. The world is in the hands of us all. And yet some have a greater influence on its fate than others. The more influence a person has - be they politician or television announcer - the greater the demands placed on their sense of responsibility and the less they should think merely about personal interests.

In conclusion, allow me a brief personal remark. I was born in Prague and I lived there for decades without being allowed to study properly or visit other countries. Nevertheless, my mother never abandoned one of her secret and quite extravagant dreams: that one day I would study at Harvard. Fate did not permit me to fulfill her dream. But something else happened, something that would never have occurred even to my mother: I have received a doctoral degree at Harvard without even having to study here.

More than that, I have been given to see Singapore, and countless other exotic places. I have been given to understand how small this world is and how it torments itself with countless things it need not torment itself with if people could find within themselves a little more courage, a little more hope, a little more responsibility, a little more mutual understanding and love.

I don’t know whether my mother is looking down at me from heaven, but if she is I can guess what she’s probably thinking; she’s thinking that I’m sticking my nose into matters that only people who have properly studied political science at Harvard have the right to stick their noses into.

I hope that you don’t think so.

Thank you for your attention.

There are two firsts for me here today. I haven’t had one of these academic gowns on since I left the sacred precincts of New Haven and Yale University to join the U.S. Army in 1941. Secondly, I haven’t been called honorable, I think, by anybody in this country at least for the last forty years. Though it is unpleasant to wear this robe in this heat and pleasant to be called honorable, neither will last longer than today, believe me. Tomorrow I will be back in contempt somewhere going into one jail or another, where I always get a urological check-up and dental care. The reason I have kept all of my teeth all these years has been that every good county jail in America has a relatively decent dental program.

When Bruno Freschi called me up and asked me what I was going to talk about, he suggested a subject, and because of his strong Canadian voice, I thought he was asking me to speak about sex. It actually was ethics. But I kept hearing sex, and I wrote on a pad to my partner, “The idiot wants me to talk about sex.” And he wrote back, “What do architectural and planning students have to do with sex?” All we could think of was erections. But then it came through loud and clear that what he was saying was ethics and not sex. So I crossed “sex” off the pad, I put “ethics” down, my partner lost interest completely, and I prepared whatever I’m going to say today.

Ethics are important, although they don’t exist very much in the United States–or maybe anywhere for that matter. On the way up on the plane, I had the New York Times on my lap, and I thought I would look and see how ethics were faring in the United States. I found ten items:

–One was a squib that a district attorney in Rockland County had pled guilty earlier in the week to income tax evasion and fraud.

–The second was that welfare recipients had entered into a conspiracy with the welfare people who signed the checks. They were receiving checks for a quarter of a million dollars in some instances and the total defrauding of the welfare system of the City of New York was $2,200,000.

–The third item was a New York City police officer pleading guilty to three counts of cocaine possession.

–The fourth was the execution last night of a hopelessly insane man in Alabama by electrocution.

–The fifth was a New Orleans police officer, a woman, alleged to have killed three people in a Vietnamese restaurant in that city while two of them were on their knees begging for mercy.

–The sixth was a Jersey City police officer suspended for killing a man in custody by beating him about the head so seriously he went into a coma and died yesterday.

–The seventh was a divorce lawyer who had hired a thug to break the leg of his opponent, another divorce lawyer, in a contested divorce proceeding.

–The eighth was Kay Wall, who had been appointed by Governor John Rowland of Connecticut, to the board of education of the state–which Governor Rolland had turned into all white now from three blacks, an Hispanic, and a white. But she was forced to disclaim her appointment because she had made an unfortunate remark that people would love her if she were black, had black hair, was 20 pounds heavier and came from the ghetto of Hartford. Because of that remark, she withdrew her nomination.

–The ninth was a congressman referring to gay people as “homos.”

–And the tenth was another congressman referring to Waco–that unfortunate tragedy at Waco, Texas, two years ago–as a plot of Bill Clinton, and referring to the federal officers involved as “thugs in jack boots.”

These ten, in one paper only. The word “ethics” apparently has very little meaning in the body politic.

Bruce Jackson referred me to a poem by John Berryman called “World Telegram,” where he read in that newspaper (long out of print but which I used to read as a boy and young man) all of the terrible things that had happened on May 13, 1939. This is the final stanza of that poem:

News of one day, one afternoon, one time.
If it were possible to take these things
Quite seriously, I believe they might
Curry disorder in the strongest brain,
Immobilize the most resilient will,
Stop trains, break up the city’s food supply,
And perfectly demoralize the nation.

He was doing in 1939 what I am doing here today. Perhaps the best way to describe this breakdown of ethical concepts in this country (except in rare and isolated places–like the University at Buffalo) is a history of the attempts to establish some form of ethos in this country.

As you know, the American Revolution was not a revolution engineered by poor people or by people who sold rats for a penny a pound down on the Long Wharf in Boston. It was engineered by the wealthy who wanted to transfer the power of wealth from London to New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. The people who fought it were those people who sold rats on the Long Wharf–the tinsmiths, the blacksmiths, and so on. But those who gained the most from it were the wealthy, the slave owners.

They met in Philadelphia in 1787. They met at what’s called Independence Hall, designed by a very famous lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, who defended John Peter Zenger in that famous freedom of speech trial in 1735 in New York. They blacked out the windows with paint so that no one would know they were going to violate their orders from those who sent them there by writing a new constitution and not reforming the Articles of Confederation, which was why they had been sent to Philadelphia. They were so afraid that people would find out what they were doing that they had Benjamin Franklin followed home every night and then followed from his lodgings to Independence Hall, because old Ben liked to tip a glass or two at the local tavern and they were afraid that he would give away the story before it was ready to be given away. They worked all summer and they evolved this document.

The document is fine. It sets up a tripartite form of government, and so on, but it says nothing about human rights whatsoever. And while they were talking about the supremacy clause in that document, somebody stood up and said, “How about a bill of rights?” This man was George Mason of Virginia. They voted on it. They voted twelve to one against a bill of rights. The only one that didn’t vote against it was, strangely enough, North Carolina. I guess those delegates from North Carolina would be very surprised to see that the man who sits in the United States Senate from that state today is Jesse Helms. They voted again. Again, twelve to one against a bill of rights.
And so, Mason left the convention, joined by John Randolph of Virginia and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. The Constitution went out for ratification and they were so afraid that it would not be ratified that they made a two-thirds vote the ratification number, rather than unanimous. Five states immediately ratified–Georgia and Connecticut among them. But the big states of Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts did not ratify immediately. In fact, as you know, the Federalist Papers were created by Hamilton and Jay and Madison to try to sell the Constitution to the New York ratifying convention. Finally, Massachusetts–meeting in the Long Wharf in Boston and led by Elbridge Gerry–had an idea: Massachusetts will ratify if you agree to have a bill of rights in the first congress. There was agreement on that score and the three big states voted narrowly–three votes in New York and ten in Virginia–and the Constitution became law.

There was an election, George Washington and John Adams were elected president and vice president, and a congress was elected. It met in Federal Hall (still standing in New York) in 1791 and there was a vote on a bill of rights. After thrashing it out for months, they finally got a bill of rights.

The Senate voted that it should not be binding on the states; the House voted that it should be binding on the states. The Senate won. (It took six hundred thousand lives between 1861 and 1865 to begin to make the Bill of Rights binding on the states.) It went out for ratification. Virginia ratified on December 15 of that year, and that became the anniversary year of the Bill of Rights.

It had twelve amendments. The first two were meaningless for present purposes; they were never voted in. They had to do with salaries for representatives and senators. You can see what was on their mind with reference to what came first. The third, Freedom of Speech became the First, and so on.

And this great ideal of the Revolution, theoretically at least, became the Bill of Rights. We were the first nation on Earth to have crystallized human rights in a document that was binding at least on the Federal government.

And, yet, over the years it has been demolished amendment by amendment by amendment. One after the other, you’ve had these terrible onslaughts, until today, the Contract With America–as you know the lunatics are running the asylum these days–the Contract With America takes out of the Bill of Rights the Fourth Amendment entirely. It consecrates all searches and seizures, whether there is or isn’t a warrant, with the phrase, “if the constable believes that he or she was acting constitutionally.” That obviates the application of the Fourth Amendment.

The Fifth Amendment with its due process of law: this execution in Alabama yesterday of an insane man who did not even know he was being executed will show you how far the inroads go into the Fifth Amendment. You also know that they are executing fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds and they are going to work on fourteen-year-olds very shortly. We have become the charnel house of the Western world with reference to executions; the next closest to us is the Republic of South Africa. We are the only nation in the western world to have capital punishment today. All of western Europe has abolished it.

On the Sixth Amendment: we have taken lawyers away from their clients. Just witness John Gotti losing his lawyer, Bruce Cutler, on the eve of trial. We’ve utilized all sorts of devices to neutralize lawyers across the country, such as contempt citations and Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which gives them the right to penalize lawyers, fine them, if some judge says the civil rights action you brought should not have been brought. I stand before you, the recipient of a $125,000 fine; the head of the NAACP legal defense fund, $40,000; the Christic Institute, a Roman Catholic civil rights legal and educational foundation–one million dollars and out of business today.

I could go through all the amendments, one by one and you would see how the First has been whittled down. Doctors, for example, not permitted to tell patients who are before them of the option of abortion.

The Second Amendment is very lively, of course. The only ones who subscribe to it are members of the National Rifle Association. So, it is of small importance to us, except they only read the gun part of it–“all citizens shall be entitled to bear arms,” and they don’t read at all the part saying those citizens should be in “a well-regulated militia.” But that’s not one of the Bill of Rights that gives any meaning today to us.

The Third doesn’t either. That’s about quartering troops in private homes. I don’t think any of you have troops quartered in private homes, unless it be your sons and daughters occasionally home from the post.

The Fourth Amendment was so vital to the colonists, because, you will remember, the King of England issued what were called writs of assistance–open-ended search warrants. They lasted as long as the king lived, and all the constable had to do was fill in the name. There was a famous case in Boston in the 1760’s where James Otis, a fiery lawyer, defended sixty-eight ministers to try to end writs of assistance. John Adams was a young lawyer in that courtroom, and when he heard Otis address the court, he said, “Then and there was the child independence born in that courtroom.” In any event, it was so important to them they enacted the Fourth Amendment: no unreasonable searches and seizures. But now, it has been dribbled away, bit by bit.

The Fifth Amendment, I’ve already mentioned–due process.

The Sixth Amendment, right to counsel. I’ve already hinted at it, and this is not a law school class, so we don’t have to go into all the details.
The Seventh doesn’t mean anything to you. It has to do with juries and civil trials.

The Eighth is the Amendment that talks about unreasonable penalties, bail, and so on. We’ve completely eliminated that. Our penalties are draconian, from the death penalty to sentences of life imprisonment for possession of cocaine, for example, and the famous “three strikes and you’re out” concept of the Contract With America. And bail has gone out the window. We have a new statute from 1984, one of Reagan’s little droppings, that says essentially that the judge can deny you bail in bailable cases if the judge comes to the conclusion you are a risk to flee or you are essentially a danger to the community. But it is not decided on ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ or even on ‘probable cause.’ The statute says clear and convincing evidence and no one knows quite what that means.

We also have anonymous juries now, as you know–that would probably come under the Fifth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment–where the jurors have numbers instead of names. I tried a case in New York some years ago where juror 318 took the stand to be questioned, a white woman. My co-counsel leaned over to me and said, “Bill, Is 318 a Jewish name?” Because you cannot tell anything except from physical characteristics of the identity of the jurors, whether they are Italian, French, German extraction, Scandinavian, or what have you. Because you don’t have the names.

I also throw into the Bill of Rights the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, Amendments, which are the great Civil War Amendments. The attacks on affirmative action and so on are gradually destroying them as well.

We’ve come to the point, I guess, where we fear so much–crime in the streets, bombings, domestic terrorism, and the like–that we are virtually willing to countenance giving up of rights because we think it will safeguard us in our daily lives, particularly in the urban centers of this country. We are succumbing, in a way, and I don’t make the analogy too close, to what the German people did when the Third Reich began to plant its foot on human rights in Germany. It was better to have a strong man; it was better to curtail rights, to be safe from the Bolsheviks, to be safe from the Versailles Treaty, and so on. And they gave in to that fear, and fear is the most dangerous quotient in any community, democratic or otherwise. Once fear takes root, then people will say, “What does it matter really if he didn’t get his Fifth, or Fourth, or Sixth or Eighth Amendment rights? That doesn’t affect me. I’m not on trial for anything; I’m not in jail. What does it matter? That’s the question Pastor Niemoller faced, when he said, “They first came for the Jews and I did not raise my voice, and then they came for me.”

It’s a hard question. Politicians pander to that fear. They talk about getting tough on crime, more executions, more prisons, prisons that would put the Marquis de Sade to shame. They thrive and get re-elected on that score and the public duly applauds: “We’ve got a man, a woman in there who’s tough on crime, ergo, let’s follow whatever he or she says. Let’s put the elected stamp of approval on the trampling of the Bill of Rights.”

Jefferson warned against this when he said if anyone really starts to trample on the Bill of Rights, we ought to throw over the traces once more. Not quite his language, but the gist of it was there. He also said “I tremble for my country when I think that God is just.” No sooner had the ink dried on the Bill of Rights when John Adams became president, succeeding George Washington. Then we had the Alien and Sedition laws, as evil a set of statutes against civil rights and human rights as ever been enacted in this country. President Lincoln suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus. The know-nothings take control from time to time. All sorts of things are done that show how weak and fragile this Bill of Rights is.

Last night I watched Judge Ito cry on television when he attended an anniversary meeting of the time when Japanese-American citizens of this country were snatched from their homes and put in concentration camps, their property confiscated for the sole reason that they were Nisei, American citizens of Japanese ancestry. And that was countenanced by a supine Supreme Court as being perfectly valid and constitutional. Slavery was countenanced by another supine supreme court as being perfectly constitutional. Segregation of the races after the civil war was countenanced as being perfectly constitutional. So we have these terrible lapses, because the ethics, the ethos, somehow vanishes in the exigencies of the moment, the perceived exigencies of the moment.

Every generation has its time to struggle. There are no green pastures.

Herman Melville wrote a book called Moby Dick. I was in the Attica yard on September 12, 1971, just 30 miles from here, sitting with an old client, Sam Melville, who was to have his head blown off the next morning with double-0 buckshot when the troopers moved in and killed 39 people, including guards as well as inmates. I said, “Sam, where’d you get the name Melville?”

He said, “I got the name Melville because I took it. My real name is not Melville, but I was so impressed by what he was saying in Moby Dick that I took that name.”

“So,” I said, “what about Moby Dick? It’s just a whale story.” I remember seeing a movie where Ahab was not Gregory Peck–that’s maybe some of your generation–but John Barrymore played the first Ahab in the first motion picture Moby Dick. And I said, “It’s just a whale story.”

He said, “No, it’s not, Bill. The white whale is evil, that swims on unconquering and unconquerable. Everybody dies on the Pequod. The Pequod is smashed to smithereens by the whale. Ahab is lashed by the harpoon lanyard to the whale’s back and is drowned, the men in the long boat are destroyed, but one man goes back to sea. You can remember his name: it was Ishmael.” And that’s how the book essentially ends, Ishmael goes back to sea.

No matter how bad the situation gets, there is always someone who goes back to sea. As long as that continues and there are those people, and it’s not the majority, believe me….

We sit here today in the comparative freedom of this institution and, yea, I’ll say this country for the moment (though I don’t believe it, too much), but I will say it, because of better men and women than we who went down in the dust somewhere in the line. They died or rotted in prisons, were expatriated, but they kept going. They were the Ishmaels of their time and our time.

This is not meant to be a speech of cynicism or to tell you how pessimistically I see the world. I’ve never seen it that way. I’ve spent over fifty years practicing this so-called profession in one state or another. I just came here from Minnesota where Qubilah Shabazz was finally set free from her ordeal in Minneapolis, and next week I go somewhere else. And I am hopeful that there always will be those Ishmaels. Those are the people I really talk to and really look for, those who are like the David of Michelangelo’s statue (which you have in the Delaware Park here). Michelangelo’s David is a good example for all of you. This is the only representation in art of David before he kills Goliath. All the rest– Donatello’s bronze, the paintings–show him holding up the severed head of Goliath, as Goliath leads the Philistines down the hills of Galilee toward the Israelites. Michelangelo is saying, across these four centuries, that every person’s life has a moment when you are thinking of doing something that will jeopardize yourself. And if you don’t do it, no one will be the wiser that you even thought of it. So, it’s easy to get out of it. And that’s what David is doing right there. He’s got the rock in the right hand, the sling over the left shoulder, and he’s saying like Prufrock, “Do I dare, do I dare?”

I hope many of you, or at least a significant few, will dare when the time comes, if it hasn’t come already.

I’d like to close with a poem I have always loved by Arthur Hugh Clough. Arthur Hugh Clough was a strange individual. I think he’s really a near First-rank English poet. He died just after the Battle of Bull Run. He had been going to school in the United States, then he returned to England. He also confronted the Church of England. He didn’t like its policies, he was a rebel. He fought all of his life and it caused him a lot of trouble. He died young, in his early forties. He died after witnessing, at least through the press, the slaughter at Bull Run number one, and after being rebuffed by the church of England for his views against it. In 1861, just before he died, he wrote the following poem which I think symbolizes how I feel–it does it in verse–but it says essentially what I want to say to all of you in this moment I have up here at this rostrum.

Say not the struggle nought availeth,
The labor and the wounds are vain,
The enemy faints not, nor faileth,
And as things have been they remain.

If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;
It may be, in yon smoke concealed,
Your comrades chase e’en now the fliers,
And but for you, possess the field.

For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,
Seem here no painful inch to gain,
Far back, through creeks and inlets making,
Comes silent, flooding in, the main.

And not by eastern windows only,
When daylight comes, comes in the light,
In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,
But westward, look, the land is bright.

Thank you.

I think the ingredients for success, or as we would say at Coca-Cola. “the secret formula,” is a combination of three things: vision, knowing what you want to be when you grow up; confidence, knowing who you are; and luck, or what I would call being in the right place at the right time.

With those three ingredients and your Georgia Tech diploma, you have the formula for success. You have a first class education from a world class university, and I really congratulate you all on your achievement.

Georgia Tech is not just a school that has national leadership in many categories of scholarship and research. It is not just an institution that has gone from the most humble beginnings to great international recognition. It is not just the home of the 1990 football champions! It is all of those things and much more. Georgia Tech today is an inspiring realization of the American dream! Like my company, Coca-Cola, your school has expanded its influence from small beginnings on North Avenue to the farthest reaches of the globe, including being a future centerpiece for the 1996 Olympics and hopefully for the 1994 World Cup Soccer. I travel extensively and I am very much attuned to worldwide trademarks and brands, and I can tell you in the academic field, Georgia Tech is achieving worldwide name recognition.

The first ingredient in the secret formula for success is vision — what you would like to be. Because remember that we all live under the same sky, but we do not have the same horizon. A vision is different, I think, from the short-term goals that characterize a young life. These are often set for you by teachers. parents, advisers. They all have, to one degree or another, some stock in your life, and they quite appropriately set goals for you.

There’s no harm in taking advice, but now you will shape your own destiny. Now you need a larger vision.

I believe that vision is an essential component of the life of a successful individual, of a successful institution, of a successful company. Let’s take my own enterprise, Coca-Cola. It has a rich history of vision.

Sometime around 1899, three wise men travelled from Chattanooga to Atlanta. Two were businessmen and the third was the inevitable lawyer. They visited with Mr. Asa Candler, the then owner of Coca-Cola, and described how, on a recent visit to Havana, Cuba, they had observed a crowd of Cubans watching a baseball game and drinking a soft drink called Pina Colada. This drink was served in a bottle that had a marble-like top that you popped open in order to consume it. They felt that this same principle could be applied to the soft drink, Coca-Cola, so as to take it out of its exclusive soda fountain venue and have it enjoyed everywhere. As some of you know. this led to these three wise men receiving the sole rights for almost all of the U.S. to place Coca-Cola in bottles, and the legal tender for this right was a symbolic $1, which appears to have never actually changed hands. Pretty good vision!

Similarly, we have the vision of Mr. Robert Woodruff who in the 1920s dreamed of creating a global marketplace for Coca-Cola. Undoubtedly, it was sparked by his belief that “life belongs to the discontented“ — that restlessness of spirit that impels some of us to go that extra step that brings about a breakthrough. Pretty good vision!

Again, still on home ground, consider Billy Payne’s vision of having Atlanta compete for the honor of becoming the host city of the 1996 Summer Olympics. In Tokyo last September, I listened to Billy Payne relate a personal, very inspiring story to the International Olympic Committee [IOC]. Billy told them how he had been a child and a young teenager in 1956 and 1960 watching the daily highlights of the Melbourne and Rome Games and how every single night of those Olympic Games he had fallen asleep imagining himself on the starting line of the 100 meter finals, only to discover the next morning that he had been dreaming. He related how later in life, while always a good athlete, he realized he would never be good enough to be an Olympian, but he never stopped dreaming. Billy was able to communicate to the IOC his new dream, the dream of an Atlantan — one of many Atlantans — who held the same dream. The dream that the Centennial Games would be celebrated in Atlanta in 1996. I tell you ladies and gentlemen, that was pretty good vision!

Georgia Tech also had the vision to participate in that effort with a total commitment of time and technological expertise. Unquestionably, Tech’s interactive video programs were a decisive factor in convincing the IOC. But I suspect that Georgia Tech had more in mind than just helping out the Atlanta Olympic Committee as a proud citizen of this city. I suspect that Georgia Tech saw that, through the platform of the Olympics, it would project an image for itself to a worldwide audience that not even Madison Avenue could conjure up. And I think it is for that same reason that Dr. Crecine is so involved in our bid for Atlanta to be one of the venues for the World Cup Soccer in 1994, an effort I am knowledgable of and appreciative of in my capacity as co-chairman of the Atlanta World Cup Soccer Advisory Board. Visionary people see in these associations things that cannot be wrought through conventional molds.

The final example of vision I will give you is America — not just the geographical entity of the U.S. — but for what America means as a vision to the world at large. You may think I am exaggerating. I beg you not to make that mistake. I have lived most of my life in other countries as an outsider looking in at the U.S. I have a deep. deep regard and affection for this nation. even though I did not have the privilege of being born here.

America is made up of an amazing, remarkable population representing virtually every race, religion, nationality, and language on earth. The diverse American people are a fabulous resource unequalled in any other nation.

The reason people continue to come here from all over the world — sometimes risking their lives — is because of this very simple, but very clear vision and that’s this incredible notion of a chance, a chance to start again. It‘s this brilliant idea that here you can wipe the slate clean and try to be whatever you want to be! With all that is wrong in this nation, it still offers people the best chance on earth to apply their skills and realize their dreams.

Even with all her warts and blemishes exposed through an open democratic society and probing news cameras, as an outsider I can tell you that the world at large still sees a nation of freedom and opportunity unequalled anywhere. While many here focus only on the failures, the world at large sees a nation that has delivered on more of its promises than any other nation ever in history.

You should be proud because although people may criticize this country. they also yearn to come here. It’s this dichotomy of feelings that is important to understand. Another ingredient I mentioned as being important to me is confidence — a basic acceptance of what I am and a realistic understanding of what I am not. It is an understanding of your potential.

To realize this potential, you must be at peace with yourself. You must focus on your strengths and attributes, and you must develop them to the max. I think I was in my twenties when this truth finally dawned on me, because until then I had been thrashing around, trying to be all things to all people. It doesn‘t work that way. Confidence in your potential means you can look anybody in the eye and not be in awe of them. Confidence is seeing an equal, level playing field.

So there you have it, my ingredients for success. Vision, confidence and thirdly, luck. Don‘t think that if you have vision and confidence, luck will come looking for you. Sometimes you have to make your own luck.

Lastly, I would caution you that as intelligent and active participants in a dynamic society like America, you must bring balance into your lives. Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them — work, family, health, friends and spirit — and you’re keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls ~ family. health, friends and spirit — are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked. nicked. damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.

You live in a world of growing opportunity at one of the most exciting times in history, and you have been prepared with an exceptionally fine education. Because you are all so well educated, let me pose this final question to you. What is education for? Is it for the pursuit of knowledge or for the pursuit of significance? How you answer makes a difference.

Knowledge is merely a tool. There is someone in Argentina or Singapore who has the same degree as you. The difference lies in how you use it. Will you use your education for life or just as a living? It‘s up to you now.

President Steinberg, Chancellor Sillerman, distinguished guests and my fellow amphibians, I stand here before you a happy and humble frog.

When I was a tadpole growing up back in the swamps, I never imagined that I would one day address such an outstanding group of scholars. And I am sure that when you were children growing up back in your own particular swamps or suburbs, you never imagined you would sit here on one of the most important days of your life listening to a short, green talking frog deliver your commencement address. All of us should feel very proud of ourselves...and just a little bit silly.

In any case, congratulations to all of you graduates. As we say in the wetlands, "Ribbit-ribbit-kneedeep-ribbit," which means "May success and a smile always be yours...even when you're kneedeep in the sticky muck of life."

Now, I know that there are some people out there who wonder what brought me here today. Was it the incoming tide on Shinnecock Bay? Was it the all-you-can-eat midnight buffet aboard the Paumanok? Or was it the promise that I'd get to play basketball with Sidney Green and the Runnin' Colonials? Don't let my spindly little arms fool you. I can slam dunk one mean basketball. While those are all very good reasons for coming to this beautiful campus, today I am here for an even more important reason--to thank each and every one of you at Southampton College.

First, of course, I want to thank you for bestowing upon me this Honorary Doctorate of Amphibious Letters. To tell you the truth, I never even knew there was such a thing as "Amphibious" Letters. After all those years on Sesame Street, you'd think I'd know my alphabet. It just goes to show that you can teach an old frog new tricks.

It's great to have an honorary doctorate. I have spoken with my fellow honorees -- Professor Merton, Ms. Meaker, Mr. Gambling -- and as honorary doctors we promise to have regular office hours, put new magazines in our waiting room, and to make late night house calls regardless of your health plan coverage. On behalf of all of us, thank you sincerely.

But I'm also here at Southampton to thank you for something even more important. I am here to thank you for the great work that you have done -- and for the great work that you will be doing with your lives. You have dedicated yourselves to preserving the beauty that is all around us. While some might look out at this great ocean and just see a magnificent view, you and I know that this ocean -- and every ecosystem -- is home to an indefinable number of my fellow animals.

As you go out into the world, never lose sight of the fact that you are not just saving the environment, you are saving the homes and lives of so many of my relatives.

On behalf of frogs, fish, pigs, bears and all of the other species who are lower than you on the food chain, thank you for dedicating your lives to saving our world and our home. In the words of my cousin, Newt -- no, not that Newt, this is another Newt -- "We appreciate what you are doing more than you can even imagine."

And so I say to you, the 1996 graduates of Southampton College, you are no longer tadpoles. The time has come for you to drop your tails and leave this swamp. But I am sure that wherever I go as I travel around the world, I will find each and every one of you working your tails off to save other swamps and give those of us who live there a chance to survive. We love you for it.

Enjoy life! And thank you very much.

President Walsh, trustees, faculty, friends, noble parents...and dear class of 1996, I am so proud of you. Thank you for asking me to speak to you today. I had a wonderful time trying to imagine who had been ahead of me on the list and had said no; I was positive you'd have to have gone to Martha Stewart first. And I meant to call her to see what she would have said, but I forgot. She would probably be up here telling you how to turn your lovely black robes into tents. I will try to be at least as helpful, if not quite as specific as that.

I'm very conscious of how easy it is to let people down on a day like this, because I remember my own graduation from Wellesley very, very well, I am sorry to say. The speaker was Santha Rama Rau who was a woman writer, and I was going to be a woman writer. And in fact, I had spent four years at Wellesley going to lectures by women writers hoping that I would be the beneficiary of some terrific secret—which I never was. And now here I was at graduation, under these very trees, absolutely terrified. Something was over. Something safe and protected. And something else was about to begin. I was heading off to New York and I was sure that I would live there forever and never meet anyone and end up dying one of those New York deaths where no one even notices you're missing until the smell drifts into the hallway weeks later. And I sat here thinking, "OK, Santha, this is my last chance for a really terrific secret, lay it on me," and she spoke about the need to place friendship over love of country, which I must tell you had never crossed my mind one way or the other.

I want to tell you a little bit about my class, the class of 1962. When we came to Wellesley in the fall of 1958, there was an article in the Harvard Crimson about the women's colleges, one of those stupid mean little articles full of stereotypes, like girls at Bryn Mawr wear black. We were girls then, by the way, Wellesley girls. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that while I was here, Wellesley actually threw six young women out for lesbianism. It was so long ago that we had curfews. It was so long ago that if you had a boy in your room, you had to leave the door open six inches, and if you closed the door you had to put a sock on the doorknob. In my class of, I don't know, maybe 375 young women, there were six Asians and 5 Blacks. There was a strict quota on the number of Jews. Tuition was $2,000 a year and in my junior year it was raised to $2,250 and my parents practically had a heart attack.

How long ago? If you needed an abortion, you drove to a gas station in Union, New Jersey, with $500 in cash in an envelope and you were taken, blindfolded, to a motel room and operated on without an anesthetic. On the lighter side, and as you no doubt read in the New York Times magazine, and were flabbergasted to learn, there were the posture pictures. We not only took off most of our clothes to have our posture pictures taken, we took them off without ever even thinking, this is weird, why are we doing this?—not only that, we had also had speech therapy—I was told I had a New Jersey accent I really ought to do something about, which was a shock to me since I was from Beverly Hills, California, and had never set foot in the state of New Jersey... not only that, we were required to take a course called Fundamentals, Fundies, where we actually were taught how to get in and out of the back seat of the car. Some of us were named things like Winkie. We all parted our hair in the middle. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that among the things that I honestly cannot conceive of life without, that had not yet been invented: panty hose, lattes, Advil, pasta (there was no pasta then, there was only spaghetti and macaroni)—I sit here writing this speech on a computer next to a touch tone phone with an answering machine and a Rolodex, there are several CDs on my desk, a bottle of Snapple, there are felt-tip pens and an electric pencil sharpener... well, you get the point, it was a long time ago.

Anyway, as I was saying, the Crimson had this snippy article which said that Wellesley was a school for tunicata—tunicata apparently being small fish who spend the first part of their lives frantically swimming around the ocean floor exploring their environment, and the second part of their lives just lying there breeding. It was mean and snippy, but it had the horrible ring of truth, it was one of those do-not-ask-for-whom-the-bell-tolls things, and it burned itself into our brains. Years later, at my 25th reunion, one of my classmates mentioned it, and everyone remembered what tunacata were, word for word.

My class went to college in the era when you got a masters degrees in teaching because it was "something to fall back on" in the worst case scenario, the worst case scenario being that no one married you and you actually had to go to work. As this same classmate said at our reunion, "Our education was a dress rehearsal for a life we never led." Isn't that the saddest line? We weren't meant to have futures, we were meant to marry them. We weren't' meant to have politics, or careers that mattered, or opinions, or lives; we were meant to marry them. If you wanted to be an architect, you married an architect. Non Ministrare sed Ministrari—you know the old joke, not to be ministers but to be ministers' wives.

I've written about my years at Wellesley, and I don't want to repeat myself any more than is necessary. But I do want to retell one anecdote from the piece I did about my 10th Wellesley reunion. I'll tell it a little differently for those of you who read it. Which was that, during my junior year, when I was engaged for a very short period of time, I thought I might transfer to Barnard my senior year. I went to see my class dean and she said to me, "Let me give you some advice. You've worked so hard at Wellesley, when you marry, take a year off. Devote yourself to your husband and your marriage." Of course it was stunning piece of advice to give me because I'd always intended to work after college. My mother was a career woman, and all of us, her four daughters, grew up understanding that the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" was as valid for girls as for boys. Take a year off being a wife. I always wondered what I was supposed to do in that year. Iron? I repeated the story for years, as proof that Wellesley wanted its graduates to be merely housewives. But I turned out to be wrong, because years later I met another Wellesley graduate who had been as hell-bent on domesticity as I had been on a career. And she had gone to the same dean with the same problem, and the dean had said to her, "Don't have children right away. Take a year to work." And so I saw that what Wellesley wanted was for us to avoid the extremes. To be instead, that thing in the middle. A lady. We were to take the fabulous education we had received here and use it to preside at dinner table or at a committee meeting, and when two people disagreed we would be intelligent enough to step in and point out the remarkable similarities between their two opposing positions. We were to spend our lives making nice.

Many of my classmates did exactly what they were supposed to when they graduated from Wellesley, and some of them, by the way, lived happily ever after. But many of them didn't. All sorts of things happened that no one expected. They needed money so they had to work. They got divorced so they had to work. They were bored witless so they had to work. The women's movement came along and made harsh value judgments about their lives—judgments that caught them by surprise, because they were doing what they were supposed to be doing, weren't they? The rules had changed, they were caught in some kind of strange time warp. They had never intended to be the heroines of their own lives, they'd intended to be—what?—First Ladies, I guess, first ladies in the lives of big men. They ended up feeling like victims. They ended up, and this is really sad, thinking that their years in college were the best years of their lives.

Why am I telling you this? It was a long time ago, right? Things have changed, haven't they? Yes, they have. But I mention it because I want to remind you of the undertow, of the specific gravity. American society has a remarkable ability to resist change, or to take whatever change has taken place and attempt to make it go away. Things are different for you than they were for us. Just the fact that you chose to come to a single-sex college makes you smarter than we were—we came because it's what you did in those days—and the college you are graduating from is a very different place. All sorts of things caused Wellesley to change, but it did change, and today it's a place that understands its obligations to women in today's world. The women's movement has made a huge difference, too, particularly for young women like you. There are women doctors and women lawyers. There are anchorwomen, although most of them are blonde. But at the same time, the pay differential between men and women has barely changed. In my business, the movie business, there are many more women directors, but it's just as hard to make a movie about women as it ever was, and look at the parts the Oscar-nominated actresses played this year: hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker, and nun. It's 1996, and you are graduating from Wellesley in the Year of the Wonderbra. The Wonderbra is not a step forward for women. Nothing that hurts that much is a step forward for women.

What I'm saying is, don't delude yourself that the powerful cultural values that wrecked the lives of so many of my classmates have vanished from the earth. Don't let the New York Times article about the brilliant success of Wellesley graduates in the business world fool you—there's still a glass ceiling. Don't let the number of women in the work force trick you—there are still lots of magazines devoted almost exclusively to making perfect casseroles and turning various things into tents.

Don't underestimate how much antagonism there is toward women and how many people wish we could turn the clock back. One of the things people always say to you if you get upset is, don't take it personally, but listen hard to what's going on and, please, I beg you, take it personally. Understand: Every attack on Hillary Clinton for not knowing her place is an attack on you. Underneath almost all those attacks are the words: Get back, get back to where you once belonged. When Elizabeth Dole pretends that she isn't serious about her career, that is an attack on you. The acquittal of O.J. Simpson is an attack on you. Any move to limit abortion rights is an attack on you—whether or not you believe in abortion. The fact that Clarence Thomas is sitting on the Supreme Court today is an attack on you.

Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim. Because you don't have the alibi my class had—this is one of the great achievements and mixed blessings you inherit: Unlike us, you can't say nobody told you there were other options. Your education is a dress rehearsal for a life that is yours to lead. Twenty-five years from now, you won't have as easy a time making excuses as my class did. You won't be able to blame the deans, or the culture, or anyone else: you will have no one to blame but yourselves. Whoa.

So what are you going to do? This is the season when a clutch of successful women—who have it all —give speeches to women like you and say, to be perfectly honest, you can't have it all. Maybe young women don't wonder whether they can have it all any longer, but in case any of you are wondering, of course you can have it all. What are you going to do? Everything, is my guess. It will be a little messy, but embrace the mess. It will be complicated, but rejoice in the complications. It will not be anything like what you think it will be like, but surprises are good for you. And don't be frightened: you can always change your mind. I know: I've had four careers and three husbands. And this is something else I want to tell you, one of the hundreds of things I didn't know when I was sitting here so many years ago: you are not going to be you, fixed and immutable you, forever. We have a game we play when we're waiting for tables in restaurants, where you have to write the five things that describe yourself on a piece of paper. When I was your age, I would have put: ambitious, Wellesley graduate, daughter, Democrat, single. Ten years later not one of those five things turned up on my list. I was: journalist, feminist, New Yorker, divorced, funny. Today not one of those five things turns up in my list: writer, director, mother, sister, happy. Whatever those five things are for you today, they won't make the list in ten years—not that you still won't be some of those things, but they won't be the five most important things about you. Which is one of the most delicious things available to women, and more particularly to women than to men. I think. It's slightly easier for us to shift, to change our minds, to take another path. Yogi Berra, the former New York Yankee who made a specialty of saying things that were famously maladroit, quoted himself at a recent commencement speech he gave. "When you see a fork in the road," he said, "take it." Yes, it's supposed to be a joke, but as someone said in a movie I made, don't laugh this is my life, this is the life many women lead: Two paths diverge in a wood, and we get to take them both. It's another of the nicest things about being women; we can do that. Did I say it was hard? Yes, but let me say it again so that none of you can ever say the words, nobody said it was so hard. But it's also incredibly interesting. You are so lucky to have that life as an option.

Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women. Thank you. Good luck. The first act of your life is over. Welcome to the best years of your lives.

Members of the Class of 1996, I see in the newspaper that Southampton University on Long Island got Kermit the Frog to give the Commencement address this year. You, unfortunately, have to make do with me. The only Muppet connection I can boast is that my former editor at Alfred Knopf was also the editor of that important self-help text, Miss Piggy's Guide to Life. I once asked him how it had been to work with such a major star and he replied, reverentially, "Salman: the pig was divine." In England, where I went to college, we don't do things quite this way on graduation day, so I've been doing a little research into Commencement and its traditions. The first American friend I asked told me that in her graduation year - not at this college, I hasten to add - she and her fellow-students were so incensed at the choice of Commencement speaker - whom I suppose I should not name - oh, all right then, it was Jeane Kirkpatrick - that they boycotted the ceremony and staged a sit-in in one of the college buildings instead. It is a considerable relief, therefore, to note that you are all here. 

As for myself, I graduated from Cambridge University in 1968 - the great year of student protest - and I have to tell you that I almost didn't make it. This story has nothing to do with politics or demonstrations; it is, rather, the improbable and cautionary tale of a thick brown gravy-and-onion sauce. It begins a few nights before my graduation day, when some anonymous wit chose to redecorate my room, in my absence, by hurling a bucketful of the aforesaid gravy-and-onions all over the walls and furniture, to say nothing of my record player and my clothes. With that ancient tradition of fairness and justice upon which the colleges of Cambridge pride themselves, my college instantly held me solely responsible for the mess, ignored all my representations to the contrary, and informed me that unless I paid for the damage before the ceremony, I would not be permitted to graduate. It was the first, but, alas, not the last occasion on which I would find myself wrongly accused of muck-spreading. I paid up, I have to report, and was therefore declared eligible to receive my degree; in a defiant spirit, possibly influenced by my recent gravy experience, I went to the ceremony wearing brown shoes, and was promptly plucked out of the parade of my gowned and properly black-shod contemporaries, and ordered back to my quarters to change. I am not sure why people in brown shoes were deemed to be dressed improperly, but once again I was facing a judgment against which there could be no appeal. Once again, I gave in, sprinted off to change my shoes, got back to the parade in the nick of time; and at length, after these vicissitudes, when my turn came, I was required to hold a university officer by his little finger, and to follow him slowly up to where the ViceChancellor sat upon a mighty throne. As instructed, I knelt at his feet, held up my hands, palms together, in a gesture of supplication, and begged in Latin for the degree, for which, I could not help thinking, I had worked extremely hard for three years, supported by my family at considerable expense. I recall being advised to hold my hands way up above my head, in case the elderly Vice-Chancellor, leaning forward to clutch at them, should topple off his great chair and land on top of me. I did as I was advised; the elderly gentleman did not topple; and, also in Latin, he finally admitted me to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. 

Looking back at that day, I am a little appalled by my passivity, hard though it is to see what else I could have done. I could have not paid up, not changed my shoes, not knelt to supplicate for my B.A. I preferred to surrender, and get the degree. I have grown more stubborn since. I have come to the conclusion, which I now offer you, that I was wrong to compromise; wrong to make an accommodation with injustice, no matter how persuasive the reasons. Injustice, today, still conjures up, in my mind, the memory of gravy. Injustice, for me, is a brown, lumpy, congealing fluid, and it smells pungently, tearfully, of onions. Unfairness is the feeling of running back to your room, flat out, at the last minute, to change your outlawed brown shoes. It is the business of being forced to beg, on your knees, in a dead language, for what is rightfully yours. This, then, is what I learned on my own graduation day; this is the message I have derived from the parables of the Unknown Gravy-bomber, the Vetoed Footwear, and the Unsteady Vice-Chancellor upon his Throne, and which I pass on to you today: first, if, as you go through life, people should some day accuse you of what one might call aggravated gravy abuse - and they will, they will - and if in fact you are innocent of abusing gravy, do not take the rap. Second: those who would reject you because you are wearing the wrong shoes are not worth being accepted by. And third: kneel before no man. Stand up for your rights. I like to think that Cambridge University, where I was so happy for three marvelous years, and from which I gained so much - I hope your years at Bard have been as happy, and that you feel you have gained as much - that Cambridge University, with its finely developed British sense of irony, intended me to learn precisely these valuable lessons from the events of that strange graduation day.

Members of the Class of 1996, we are here to celebrate with you one of the great days of your lives. We participate today in the rite of passage by which you are released from this life of preparation into that life for which you are now as prepared as anyone ever is. As you stand at the gate of the future, I should like to share with you a piece of information about the extraordinary institution you are leaving, which will explain the reason why it is such a particular pleasure for me to be with you today. In 1989, within weeks of the threat made against me by the mullahs of Iran, I was approached by the President of Bard, through my literary agent, and asked if I would consider accepting a place on the faculty of this college. More than a place; I was assured that I could find, here in Annandale, among the Bard community, many friends, and a safe haven in which I could live and work. Alas, I was not able, in those difficult days, to take up this courageous offer, but I have never forgotten that at a moment when red-alert signals were flashing all over the world, and all sorts of people and institutions were running scared, Bard College did the opposite - that it moved towards me, in intellectual solidarity and human concern, and made, not lofty speeches, but a concrete offer of help. I hope you will all feel proud that Bard, quietly, without fanfares, made such a principled gesture at such a time. I am certainly extremely proud to be a recipient of Bard's honorary degree, and to have been accorded the exceptional privilege of addressing you today.

Hubris, according to the Greeks, was the sin of defying the gods, and could, if you were really unlucky, unleash against you the terrifying, avenging figure of the goddess Nemesis, who carried in one hand an apple-bough and, in the other, the Wheel of Fortune, which would one day circle round to the inevitable moment of vengeance. As I have been, in my time, accused not only of gravy abuse and wearing brown shoes but of hubris, too, and since I have come to believe that such defiance is an inevitable and essential aspect of what we call freedom, I thought I might commend it to you. For in the years to come you will find yourselves up against gods of all sorts, big and little gods, corporate and incorporeal gods, all of them demanding to be worshipped and obeyed - the myriad deities of money and power, of convention and custom, that will seek to limit and control your thoughts and lives. Defy them; that's my advice to you. Thumb your noses; cock your snooks. For, as the myths tell us, it is by defying the gods that human beings have best expressed their humanity. The Greeks tell many stories of quarrels between us and the gods. Arachne, the great artist of the loom, sets her skills of weaving and embroidery against those of the goddess of wisdom herself, Minerva or Pallas Athene; and impudently chooses to weave versions of only those scenes which reveal the mistakes and weaknesses of the gods - the rape of Europa, Leda and the Swan. For this - for the irreverence, not for her lesser skill - for what we would now call art, and chutzpah - the goddess changes her mortal rival into a spider. Queen Niobe of Thebes tells her people not to worship Latona, the mother of Diana and Apollo, saying "What folly is this! - To prefer beings whom you never saw to those who stand before your eyes!" For this sentiment, which today we would call humanism, the gods murder her children and husband, and she metamorphoses into a rock, petrified with grief, from which there trickles an unending river of tears. Prometheus the Titan steals fire from the gods and gives it to mankind. For this - for what we would now call the desire for progress, for improved scientific and technological capabilities - he is bound to a rock while a great bird gnaws eternally at his liver, which regenerates as it is consumed. The interesting point is that the gods do not come out of these stories at all well. If Arachne is overly proud when she seeks to compete with a goddess, it is only an artist's pride, joined to the gutsiness of youth; whereas Minerva, who could afford to be gracious, is merely vindictive. The story increases Arachne's shadow, as they say, and diminishes Minerva's. It is Arachne who gains, from the tale, a measure of immortality. And the cruelty of the gods to the family of Niobe proves her point. Who could prefer the rule of such cruel gods to self-rule, the rule of men and women by men and women, however flawed that may be? Once again, the gods are weakened by their show of strength, while the human beings grow stronger, even though - even as - they are destroyed. And tormented Prometheus, of course, Prometheus with his gift of fire, is the greatest hero of all. It is men and women who have made the world, and they have made it in spite of their gods. The message of the myths is not the one the gods would have us learn - that we should behave ourselves and know our place - but its exact opposite. It is that we must be guided by our natures. Our worst natures can, it's true, be arrogant, venal, corrupt, or selfish; but in our best selves, we - that is, you - can and will be joyous, adventurous, cheeky, creative, inquisitive, demanding, competitive, loving, and defiant.

Do not bow your heads. Do not know your place. Defy the gods. You will be astonished how many of them turn out to have feet of clay. Be guided, if possible, by your better natures. Great good luck and many congratulations to you all.

These are moments to be cherished in America life: The realization of a common dream, unique, really, to this land - a college education, a privilege not confined to the well-born or wealthy. Here the working class sits side by side with old and new fortunes; here new Americans from distant lands and cultures mingle with the sons and daughters of Americans who came on sailing ships, some to proclaim their freedom, others in the holds and chains of slave ships. I am honored to be with you. I know what is expected of me. Brevity, most of all. Maybe a little humor. Wisdom, or the appearance of it. I am here as a journalist, but I am also here as a husband, a father and a citizen. That is the four-part harmony of my life and they are complementary parts; I am incomplete if any one is missing.

I am also a child of the second half of the 20th century. I was born in 1940 and my earliest memories are of the pain and the glories of World War II; I came of age with the threat of nuclear war in the world - and greatest innocence at home; I stood on the front lines of the battle for civil rights and am haunted still by the personal and political price this nation paid in Vietnam; I can tell you when I first heard Elvis and when I first saw The Beatles. One president was assassinated, another was forced to resign, communism fell. Women in America began to take their rightful place. The American family began to take on new forms, alas, too often to the detriment of family members and society.

It was a time of momentous change. Mind boggling, world altering, exhilarating, disorienting change. And it was merely an overture for your generation. The sound you hear is a new century, coming fast, with changes and challenges yet unimagined.

This is your time: the 21st century. The millennium. It is yours to shape and master. It makes my heart race. I envy you.

You have at your disposal a dazzling assortment of new tools not even imagined not so long ago. The gee whiz tools of communications and information: cable television, satellites, cell phones, pagers, faxes and, of course, the king of them all, the personal computer. Who could ask for anything more?

Well, here is a modest suggestion as you lead us into the new century. This will be the cyberspace equivalent of a teenage joyride - reckless and pointless - unless we all apply the lessons of earlier technological revolutions to this one.  They almost all have had unexpected consequences, and they are most successful when as much effort and thought is applied to the use of the technology as to the development of it in the first place.

If this new technology becomes simply another means of amusing ourselves, or speeding the transactions of commerce or communicating simply for the sake of communication, then we will have failed.

If this new technology becomes primarily the province of the privileged, leaving the underclass to wander in cyber-wilderness, then we will have failed. If it becomes merely an instrument of greater invasion into our personal lives, then we will have failed.

This is your technology. Indeed, with the introduction of the cyber age we have fundamentally altered a relationship between generations. This is the first time the kids have taught their parents to drive.

It's where we're headed that concerns me. One of my principal passions is the environment and biological diversity. Cyber technology is a great vehicle for information exchange, mapping and research. But if we become a nation of shut-ins, more engrossed in a virtual rain forest than the real, thick, seamy, green, vibrant, living, breathing experience, we will be poorer for it. For all of its capacity, this new technology also is of little use in solving what I believe is the most vexing issue in American life: race. There is no delete button for bigotry. We may be color blind as we surf the 'net, but alas, on the street, in the workplace, in our homes and social life, we - more than we care to acknowledge - see life through a prism of pigmentation.

We're doing better. I grew up in apartheid America. Now we have the laws of the land, the richer tapestry of ethnic achievement and prominence, people of courage on all sides of the racial dynamic.

We are increasingly a land of many colors, a geography of Asian, Latino and African hues against a diminishing backdrop of white European stock. If we allow racism, expressed either as utter bigotry or dressed up as executive ethnic pride, to metastasize at the current rates, we'll soon find ourselves at an incurable stage, unable to build walls high enough, schools private enough, industries insulated enough to withstand the ravages of racism.

It requires instead that most basic and yet most vexing human condition: an open mind and an open heart. That can be your legacy. We seem at the moment to be caught in a cycle of easy and cheap distraction. 

Celebrity has been at once devalued and raised to an artificially high place in our popular culture. Never mind achievement or worth that stands the test of time. A moment in the spotlight of television is life itself for dysfunctional families willing to share their sordid secrets on daytime talk shows; for parents to put their youngsters in the cockpits of small planes on stormy days; for performers to reach ever further into the universe of the outrageous to make an impression; for producers and editors to succumb to the easy temptations of titillation rather than intellectual provocation.

And we encourage that by our benign attention.

Is that how we want to measure, in the closing days of the 20th century, what has been called the American Century?

We're better than that, or we should be.

I've watched this country go from the vanilla '50s to the psychedelic '60's, to the disco '70's, to the greedy '80's.

Now, in the uncertain '90's, what worries me most is the enduring cynicism in our land about the separation from the traditional institutions of public life, city hall, state house, especially Washington. I cannot remember a time when there was such recognition that the traditional framework of society - of family and faith and community and responsibility and accountability - was in such desperate need of repair.

Your immediate concerns, understandable, are jobs and careers and relationships. Indeed. They will remain your primary focus for they are about personal happiness and survival.

However, the means by which your time will be measured, will be the values that you embrace, the care that you show for each other. Yours can be the age of tolerance and understanding.

To be true to the meaning of this institution and the purpose of its education I urge you to remember the counsel of the late Bartlett Giammatti, Yale president, major league baseball commissioner and Renaissance man. In a setting quite like this in a lesser-known Eastern institution he said, "you must know that idealism is not a paralyzing but a liberating force and that to strive for principles, even if the journey is never completed, is to tap a vast source of energy, the energy to commit to your best in the brief, precious time that each of us is blessed to have." 

Fifty years ago - in 1946 - another generation of young Americans marked a special spring in their lives. Together with the British, other Western allies and especially the Russians they had just won the war against Hitler and Nazi Germany and imperialist Japan. They had saved the world. They came home, and they built the America we know today. They kept the peace. They went to college in historic proportions, they married and had families. They built giant industries and small businesses. They gave us great universities and great highway systems. They integrated America. They discovered new cures and gave us new songs. They rebuilt their enemies and stood tall against new adversaries in Moscow and Beijing.

And they didn't whine or whimper.

I am in awe of them.

Fifty years from now let another commencement speaker stand here and say of your generation: they saved their world and I am in awe of them.

This is your time. Take it on. Don't be afraid to lean into the wind, love the earth in all of its natural glories and take care of each other. We're counting on you. 

Thank you. Thank you, President Pforzheimer. Governor Weld, President Rudenstine, President Wilson, fellow honorands, men and women of Harvard, all those who comprise the Harvard community, guests and friends, thank you.

I'm delighted to be here on this day of celebration and rededication. To those of you who are here from the class of '97, I say congratulations. You may be in debt, but you made it. And if you're not in debt now, after the alumni association gets through with you, you will be.

In fact, I would like to solicit the help of this audience for the State Department budget. It is under $20 billion.

As a former professor and current mother, I confess to loving graduation days - especially when they are accompanied by an honorary degree. I love the ceremony; I love the academic settings; and although it will be difficult for me today - let's be honest - I love to daydream during the commencement speech.

Graduations are unique among the milestones of our lives, because they celebrate past accomplishments, while also anticipating the future. That is true for each of the graduates today, and it is true for the United States. During the past few years, we seem to have observed the 50th anniversary of everything. Through media and memory, we have again been witness to paratroopers filling the skies over Normandy; the liberation of Buchenwald; a sailor's kiss in Times Square; and Iron Curtain descending; and Jackie Robinson sliding home.

Today, we recall another turning point in that era. For on this day 50 years ago, Secretary of State George Marshall addressed the graduating students of this great university. He spoke to a class enriched by many who had fought for freedom, and deprived of many who had fought for freedom and died. The Secretary's words were plain; but his message reached far beyond the audience assembled in this yard to an American people weary of war and wary of new commitments, and to a Europe where life-giving connections between farm and market, enterprise and capital, hope and future had been severed.

Secretary Marshall did not adorn his rhetoric with high-flown phrases, saying only that it would be logical for America to help restore normal economic health to the world, without which there could be no political stability and no assured peace. He did not attach to his plan the label, Made in America; but rather invited European ideas and required European countries to do all they could to help themselves. His vision was inclusive, leaving the door open to participation by all, including the Soviet Union - and so there would be no repetition of the punitive peace of Versailles - also to Germany.

British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin called the Marshall Plan a "lifeline to sinking men," and it was - although I expect some women in Europe were equally appreciative.

By extending that lifeline, America helped unify Europe's west around democratic principles, and planted seeds of transatlantic partnership that would soon blossom in the form of NATO and the cooperative institutions of a new Europe. Just as important was the expression of American leadership that the Marshall Plan conveyed.

After World War I, America had withdrawn from the world, shunning responsibility and avoiding risk. Others did the same. The result in the heart of Europe was the rise of great evil. After the devastation of World War II and the soul-withering horror of the Holocaust, it was not enough to say that the enemy had been vanquished, that what we were against had failed.

The generation of Marshall, Truman and Vandenberg was determined to build a lasting peace. And the message that generation conveyed, from the White House, from both parties on Capitol Hill, and from people across our country who donated millions in relief cash, clothing and food was that this time, America would not turn inward; America would lead.

Today, in the wake of the Cold War, it is not enough for us to say that Communism has failed. We, too, must heed the lessons of the past, accept responsibility and lead. Because we are entering a century in which there will be many interconnected centers of population, power and wealth, we cannot limit our focus, as Marshall did in his speech to the devastated battleground of a prior war. Our vision must encompass not one, but every continent.

Unlike Marshall's generation, we face no single galvanizing threat. The dangers we confront are less visible and more diverse - some as old as ethnic conflict, some as new as letter bombs, some as subtle as climate change, and some as deadly as nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. To defend against these threats, we must take advantage of the historic opportunity that now exists to bring the world together in an international system based on democracy, open markets, law and a commitment to peace.

We know that not every nation is yet willing or able to play its full part in this system. One group is still in transition from centralized planning and totalitarian rule. Another has only begun to dip its toes into economic and political reform. Some nations are still too weak to participate in a meaningful way. And a few countries have regimes that actively oppose the premises upon which this system is based.

Because the situation we face today is different from that confronted by Marshall's generation, we cannot always use the same means. But we can summon the same spirit. We can strive for the same sense of bipartisanship that allowed America in Marshall's day to present to both allies and adversaries a united front. We can invest resources needed to keep America strong economically, militarily and diplomatically - recognizing, as did Marshall, that these strengths reinforce each other. We can act with the same knowledge that in our era, American security and prosperity are linked to economic and political health abroad. And we can recognize, even as we pay homage to the heroes of history, that we have our own duty to be authors of history.

Let every nation acknowledge today the opportunity to be part of an international system based on democratic principles is available to all. This was not the case 50 years ago.

Then, my father's boss, Jan Masaryk, foreign minister of what was then Czechoslovakia - was told by Stalin in Moscow that his country must not participate in the Marshall Plan, despite its national interest in doing so. Upon his return to Prague, Masaryk said it was at that moment, he understood he was employed by a government no longer sovereign in its own land.

Today, there is no Stalin to give orders. If a nation is isolated from the international community now, it is either because the country is simply too weak to meet international standards, or because its leaders have chosen willfully to disregard those standards.

Last week in the Netherlands, President Clinton said that no democratic nation in Europe would be left out of the transatlantic community. Today I say that no nation in the world need be left out of the global system we are constructing. And every nation that seeks to participate and is willing to do all it can to help itself will have America's help in finding the right path.

In Africa, poverty, disease, disorder and misrule have cut off millions from the international system. But Africa is a continent rich both in human and natural resources. And today, it's best new leaders are pursuing reforms that are helping private enterprise and democratic institutions to gain a foothold. Working with others, we must lend momentum by maintaining our assistance, encouraging investment, lowering the burden of debt and striving to create successful models for others to follow.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, integration is much further advanced. Nations throughout our hemisphere are expanding commercial ties, fighting crime, working to raise living standards and cooperating to ensure that economic and political systems endure.

In Asia and the Pacific, we see a region that has not only joined the international system, but has become a driving force behind it - a region that is home to eight of the ten fastest growing economies in the world.

With our allies, we have worked to ease the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program, and invited that country to end its self-imposed isolation. We have encouraged China to expand participation in the international system and to observe international norms on everything from human rights to export of arms-related technologies.

Finally, in Europe, we are striving to fulfill the vision Marshall proclaimed but the Cold War prevented - the vision of a Europe, whole and free, united - as President Clinton said this past week - "not by the force of arms, but by possibilities of peace."

Where half a century ago, American leadership helped lift Western Europe to prosperity and democracy, so today the entire transatlantic community is helping Europe's newly free nations fix their economies and cement the rule of law.

Next month in Madrid, NATO will invite new members from among the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, while keeping the door to future membership open to others. This will not, as some fear, create a new source of division within Europe. On the contrary, it is erasing the unfair and unnatural line imposed half a century ago; and it is giving nations an added incentive to settle territorial disputes, respect minority and human rights and complete the process of reform.

NATO is a defensive alliance that harbors no territorial ambitions. It does not regard any state as its adversary, certainly not a democratic and reforming Russia that is intent on integrating with the West, and with which it has forged an historic partnership, signed in Paris just nine days ago.

Today, from Ukraine to the United States, and from Reykjavik to Ankara, we are demonstrating that the quest for European security is no longer a zero-sum game. NATO has new allies and partners. The nations of Central and Eastern Europe are rejoining in practice the community of values they never left in spirit. And the Russian people will have something they have not had in centuries - a genuine and sustainable peace with the nations to their west.

The Cold War's shadow no longer darkens Europe. But one specter from the past does remain. History teaches us that there is no natural geographic or political endpoint to conflict in the Balkans, where World War I began and where the worst European violence of the past half-century occurred in this decade. That is why the peaceful integration of Europe will not be complete until the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia are fulfilled. (Applause.)

When defending the boldness of the Marshall Plan 50 years ago, Senator Arthur Vandenberg observed that it does little good to extend a 15-foot rope to a man drowning 20 feet away. Similarly, we cannot achieve our objectives in Bosnia by doing just enough to avoid immediate war. We must do all we can to help the people of Bosnia to achieve permanent peace.

In recent days, President Clinton has approved steps to make the peace process irreversible, and give each party a clear stake in its success. This past weekend, I went to the region to deliver in person the message that if the parties want international acceptance or our aid, they must meet their commitments - including full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal.

That tribunal represents a choice not only for Bosnia and Rwanda, but for the world. We can accept atrocities as inevitable, or we can strive for a higher standard. We can presume to forget what only God and the victims have standing to forgive, or we can heed the most searing lesson of this century which is that evil, when unopposed, will spawn more evil.

The majority of Bosnia killings occurred not in battle, but in markets, streets and playgrounds, where men and women like you and me, and boys and girls like those we know, were abused or murdered - not because of anything they had done, but simply for who they were.

We all have a stake in establishing a precedent that will deter future atrocities, in helping the tribunal make a lasting peace easier by separating the innocent from the guilty; in holding accountable the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing; and in seeing that those who consider rape just another tactic of war answer for their crimes.

Since George Marshall's time, the United States has played the leading role within the international system - not as sole arbiter of right and wrong, for that is a responsibility widely shared, but as pathfinder - as the nation able to show the way when others cannot.

In the years immediately after World War II, America demonstrated that leadership not only through the Marshall Plan, but through the Truman Doctrine, the Berlin airlift and the response to Communist aggression in Korea.

In this decade, America led in defeating Saddam Hussein; encouraging nuclear stability in the Korean Peninsula and in the former Soviet Union; restoring elected leaders to Haiti; negotiating the Dayton Accords; and supporting the peacemakers over the bomb throwers in the Middle East and other strategic regions.

We welcome this leadership role, not in Teddy Roosevelt's phrase, because we wish to be "an international Meddlesome Matty," but because we know from experience that our interests and those of our allies may be affected by regional or civil wars, power vacuums that create opportunities for criminals and terrorists and threats to democracy.

But America cannot do the job alone. We can point the way and find the path, but others must be willing to come along and take responsibility for their own affairs. Others must be willing to act within the bounds of their own resources and capabilities to join in building a world in which shared economic growth is possible, violent conflicts are constrained, and those who abide by the law are progressively more secure.

While in Sarajevo, I visited a playground in the are once known as "sniper's alley," where many Bosnians had earlier been killed because of ethnic hate. But this past weekend, the children were playing there without regard to whether the child in the next swing was Muslim, Serb or Croat. They thanked America for helping to fix their swings, and asked me to place in the soil a plant which they promised to nourish and tend.

It struck me then that this was an apt metaphor for America's role 50 years ago, when we planted the seeds of renewed prosperity and true democracy in Europe; and a metaphor as well for America's role during the remaining years of this century and into the next.

As this great university has recognized, in the foreign students it has attracted, the research it conducts, the courses it offers, and the sensibility it conveys, those of you who have graduated today will live global lives. You will compete in a world marketplace; travel further and more often than any previous generation; share ideas, tastes and experiences with counterparts from every culture; and recognize that to have a full and rewarding future, you will have to look outwards.

As you do, and as our country does, we must aspire to set high standards set by Marshall, using means adapted to our time, based on values that endure for all time; and never forgetting that America belongs on the side of freedom.

I say this to you as Secretary of State. I say it also as one of the many people whose lives have been shaped by the turbulence of Europe during the middle of this century, and by the leadership of America throughout this century.

I can still remember in England, during the war, sitting in the bomb shelter, singing away the fear and thanking God for America help. I can still remember, after the war and after the Communist takeover in Prague, arriving here in the United States, where I wanted only to be accepted and to make my parents and my new country proud.

Because my parents fled in time, I escaped Hitler. To our shared and constant sorrow, millions did not. Because of America's generosity, I escaped Stalin. Millions did not. Because of the vision of Truman-Marshall generation, I have been privileged to live my life in freedom. Millions have still never had that opportunity. It may be hard for you, who have no memory of that time 50 years ago, to understand. But it is necessary that you try to understand.

Over the years, many have come to think of World War II as the last good war, for if ever a cause was just, that was it. And if ever the future of humanity stood in the balance, it was then.

Two full generations of Americans have grown up since that war - first mine, now yours; two generation of boys and girls, who have seen the veterans at picnics and parades and fireworks saluting with medals and ribbons on their chests; seeing the pride in their bearing and thinking, perhaps, what a fine thing it must have been - to be tested in a great cause and to have prevailed.

But today of all days, let us not forget that behind each medal and ribbon, there is a story of heroism yes, but also profound sadness; for World War II was not a good war. From North Africa to Solerno, from Normandy to the Bulge to Berlin, an entire continent lost to Fascism had to be taken back, village by village, hill by hill. And further eastward, from Tarawa to Okinawa, the death struggle for Asia was an assault against dug-in positions, surmounted only by unbelievable courage at unbearable loss.

Today, the greatest danger to America is not some foreign enemy. It is the possibility that we will fail to hear the example of that generation; that we will allow the momentum towards democracy to stall; take for granted the institutions and principles upon which our own freedom is based; and forget what the history of this century reminds us - that problems abroad, if left unattended, will all too often come home to America. (Applause.)

A decade or two from now, we will be known as neo-isolationists who allowed tyranny and lawlessness to rise again; or as the generation that solidified the global triumph of democratic principles. We will be known as the neo-protectionists, whose lack of vision produced financial meltdown; or as the generation that laid the groundwork for rising prosperity around the world. We will be known as the world-class ditherers, who stood by while the seeds of renewed global conflict were sown; or as the generation that took strong measures to forge alliances, deter aggression and keep the peace.

There is no certain road map to success, either for individuals or for generations. Ultimately, it is a matter of judgment, a question of choice. In making that choice, let us remember that there is not a page of American history, of which we are proud, that was authored by a chronic complainer or prophet of despair. We are doers. We have a responsibility, as others have had in theirs, not to be prisoners of history, but to shape history; a responsibility to fill the role of pathfinder, and to build with others a global network of purpose and law that will protect our citizens, defend our interests, preserve our values, and bequeath to future generations a legacy as proud as the one we honor today.

To that mission, I pledge my own best efforts and summon yours. Thank you very, very much.

It's always embarrassing to hear people say all of these wonderful things about me. I am compelled to reflect on how I felt almost 50 years ago, sitting in Commencement exercises at Howard University, graduating not with honor but with mercy, not cum laude or magna cum laude but "O thank you, Lordy." And I think I represent the trifling, undisciplined underachievers who are sitting out there guilty as hell because you have wasted four years.

When Martin Luther King won the Nobel Prize, one of his teachers said - and his wife got very angry - "You know, he was really not a very distinguished student. We had many students in class with more promise and potential than he had." And I'm sure, some 20 years ago, when Anita Defrantz ['74] sat where you sit, there were very few people who could have imagined the impact she would have on the world of sport. In fact, if your coach had not noticed this wonderful young lady and helped her become a rower and Olympian, many great things would never have happened. She would not had the unmitigated gall to challenge the president of the United States and the foreign policy of her nation when they refused to participate in the Olympic games in Moscow. She would not have been named to the International Olympic Committee. Atlanta probably would not have won [the hosting of] the Olympic Games. And she would not be standing in line as one of the foremost prospects to lead international sport into the 21st century.

I mention this only to point out that you have no idea what God has in store for you. It makes no difference what you have done up to now. It doesn't even matter what you think of yourself. There will be many dangerous toils and snares through which you must pass.

But our presence on this campus today should remind us that we as Americans approaching the 21st century, we as Americans in a Judeo-Christian tradition, we as Americans with the educational opportunity afforded by this college, we live in the midst of an amazing grace. And nothing is impossible. 

Jesse Jackson always says, "If you can conceive it and believe it, you can achieve it." And I go even further than that because I could not have even conceived of becoming a member of the congress of the United States or an ambassador to the United Nations. In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined that. And yet history puts us on a roller coaster that gives us the thrills of a lifetime and takes us places where we dare not go.

Responding to the forces of history we are compelled to take our place and stand tall for the things we believe in.

One of the great dreams of my time was the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan changed the world, and its ideal is still around: The ideal that America can be involved in the development of an entire planet. The ideal that it is possible on Earth that no child need go hungry. The things the world needs are so imminently doable, it only takes the will and determination and the political commitment of a people to make it the kind of world we can all be proud of.

Whether we call it a Marshall Plan and whether it is run by governments or by the private sector, which is more likely, I want you to look at the world and realize it calls you to leadership. And you needn't know where you go. You only need to take one step at a time. History will lead you down paths of excellence and paths of creativity that even in your wildest dreams you cannot now imagine.

There is also a sense in which America is still poor. Martin Luther King was killed simply for insisting that America could not continue with people isolated on lonely islands of poverty in the midst of an ocean of material wealth. And those lonely islands of poverty, even more than race, threaten the domestic tranquility of our nation, for many of the people who are bogged down in problems of crime, many of the people who are suffering from the kind of alienation that makes them want to blow up government buildings or shave their heads in hostility, many of those young people are victims of the poverty in our midst. They see the world going by and leaving them behind. They hear no one speaking up in their behalf. And there is a lashing out in anger and in bitterness, which expresses itself in antisocial behavior.

We can build bigger prisons to contain antisocial behavior, or we can reach out with love and understanding, putting an end to that kind of behavior.

I say that poverty in America is not inevitable, nor necessary. Indeed, just the opposite is true. If capitalism is going to expand, it is going to expand into new markets. That's the reason we created the North American Free Trade Agreement, adding Mexico and Canada to the U.S. economy. But the black economy in our central cities has a gross national product larger than Mexico and Canada combined, and it is still underdeveloped. If you think of the economy of rural white America, small towns where the banks are closing and abandoning the people, then there is another underdeveloped economy.

I think the happiest times I have spent in my childhood have been in small towns. The love and family atmosphere at this small college probably contributed more to your education than you realize. You will come to appreciate the size of this campus and the fact that people know your name and that people care about you. This is an extended family that will go with you forever. Many college graduates this spring will receive the same degree as you do today, yet they will not receive it with the love and prayer and commitment you are taking from this college. These are qualities that come from being just the right size. Transforming the megalopolis to right-sized communities is going to be done by people who are committed to translating the ideals of their lives into the lives of their neighbors.

And then there is the African continent. We've been through the Asian miracle, but I think that Africa, with all of her power and all of her wealth, is perhaps the hope of the 21st century. There is on the African continent the resource base, the human potential and the need that will create a vast opportunity for the continued growth of free enterprise. The problem of debt, the problem of disease - many of the problems we have already solved in this country - will be solved in the 21st century on the African continent. You will be a part of those solutions.

This is a beautiful day. God has blessed you far beyond your deserving, and you can't even imagine at this point how much that is. But it's going to get better from here on in because hardly one percent of the people on the planet have the talent, the resources, the love, the vision and commitment that you have acquired as a result of your involvement with this institution.

Not far from here a ship called the Amistad docked 150 years ago. It was out of the impression made by slaves on students in Connecticut that those people were set free and an antislavery movement began. What the movie did not portray was the enormous missionary movement that went south and established more than 500 schools and colleges for former slaves. That movement expanded to Africa and helped create the middle class that is making possible freedom and opportunity today.

Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela were not accidents. The school that Martin Luther King went to in Atlanta was founded by the same kind of people from New England that founded the school that Nelson Mandela went to in South Africa. That is a glorious tradition, a tradition that is your tradition, a tradition that will continue under your leadership, and all of us will be the better for it. 

God has blessed you. Go in peace.

I've come to you this morning with a topic that probably in an earlier age would have sounded a little bit absurd. And that’s the question of whether character matters, whether it has anything to do with public service.

Now even as recently as a generation ago, probably no one would give a commencement talk on that address to educated people -- people getting their degree -- because education was considered to be not only the acquisition of knowledge, but the formation of moral character. That’s what education was all about.

As a matter of fact, the president of Harvard University, until the middle of the last century, personally taught the courses in ethics. Every college in America before the twentieth century was started by Christians, with one exception, the University of South Carolina. Even when I was at Brown in the 1950's, chapel was mandatory.

Can you imagine in that liberal bastion today? How dramatically things have changed. And so, we have taken the moral component out of culture. Teddy Roosevelt, President Teddy Roosevelt, understood exactly where that would lead us. He said, “To educate a man in the mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.”

Thank God for institutions like Geneva, where you still care about educating people not only in the mind but in the conscience and in the moral education and formation as well.

Even in our country we’ve gone through a dramatic and rapid change. Remember the ethical malaise of the 80's with everybody concerned about all of the Wall Street scandals and Boesky and Milken and all of those names which are now legend? We went after them with a vengeance because we knew something was wrong in American life, and there was an ethical concern. The Washington Post said, "We’ve reached the point where 'common decency' can no longer be described as common." Time Magazine: "Hypocrisy, betrayal, greed unsettle a nation’s soul."

And we were deeply concerned in the 80's with the question of ethics and moral behavior -- so concerned that we took Clarence Thomas when he went for his confirmation hearing and tore him apart on the issue of character, and whether his personal character had anything to do with what kind of a Supreme Court Justice he would be. And actually, that was a valid question -- whether the questioning of Thomas was valid or not -- that was a valid question. Senator John Tower happened to be a friend of mine, was nominated to be Secretary of Defense. He was denied the nomination to be Secretary of Defense because of womanizing and drinking allegations, perhaps rightly so. Bob Packwood was driven from the Senate for, who had a long and distinguished career in the United States Senate, for unseemly behavior with women, rightly so in my opinion.

But what has happened just a decade later in the 90's? In the 90's, to follow the polls -- and what I am going to say has no partisan overtones of any kind, because I would say this if there was a Republican in the Whitehouse or a Democrat in the Whitehouse. It makes absolutely no difference. But if the charges that have been made are correct, if there's any validity whatsoever -- and I underline the if, and I tell you I pray daily for the President and for our leaders because my God commands me to do so, and every one of you should do the same thing.

But two thirds of the American people say that, if indeed the President of the United States committed perjury, subornation of perjury, tampering with witnesses, and committed a series of sexual indiscretions that it should make no difference because the country is doing so well.

Even at the same time, 97% of the American people say that they believe their own moral behavior is superior to the President. I can only describe it as if a  spaceship has suddenly flown over America and dropped some de-sensitizing nerve gas upon it, so that everybody’s moral nerve endings have been totally numbed. And it's as if we don’t care -- that character means nothing -- that it’s okay -- anything you want to do.

If you want to go back and do some summer reading, go back and get Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, written in the late 30's, because he turned out to be the greater prophet of the latter half of the 20th century, not Orwell with 1984, as we believe. And he said, we would simply be amused into submission so that the powers, the controller of the State, could take us over -- because everybody would have free sex, and a soma, a little pill that they would take that would make them feel good in all occasions. And if you could make people feel good, they wouldn’t care about anything else. It’s almost as if, God forbid, that has happened. It was a radically new concept.

Now, let me give you a quiz question. I will ask you to think about this. You probably know the answer if you studied any philosophy here at Geneva, and I’m sure you must have. Many of you have at least three degrees. This will be your final college exam. And if you don’t use it ever again in life, you might appear on jeopardy and you’ll know the answer.

“What was Socrates and his interlocutors trying to discover in the great classic of philosophy called, The Republic?”

What was the question? Simple question: "What is justice?"

And, "Is it better to appear just or to be just?"

And if you read the book you know the great story when, he, Socrates tells the ring of Gyges. And Gyges finds this ring that allows him to do anything that it wants, invincibility. It allows him to steal the king's throne and his wife. Above all, Gyges seeks to serve his own interests. And then Socrates asks us, was that the right thing to do -- even if in the process he was able to appear righteous in society? America, today, does not ask that question. Instead we ask, "How will Gyges handle the economy?"

We’ve lost what’s been the basic question that people have asked all through history: "What’s justice?" "Better to be right, or to appear right?" Think about it. Everything you do in your life, every single decision you make, ask yourself, “Is it better to appear right or to be right?” And if you answer that question, you will have lives of nobility and decency and character, and you'll contribute something of worth to your society and to your culture.

What is character? What do we mean when we use that term. Character is a neutral word. The character of something is that the character of this [the podium] is that it’s made of wood. But the question is whether we care about good character; whether we care about the kind of person who has always been perceived not by others, but known to be true -- in his heart that he believes in truth, justice, nobility, honesty. Or are we a person who accepts lies, self serving, dishonest, given to the baser passion. And every society up until this moment has always exalted virtue and said that bad character is something to be discouraged and the baser passion to be restrained. Michael Novak says it so beautifully. He said, “A society of Americans which exalts virtue has 270 million policemen. A society that mocks virtue can’t hire enough.” And you know what happens to a society that can’t hire enough police. The Germans, and the Italians, and the Japanese, and the Russians found out.

Our Founding Fathers would be appalled that we would even be asking these questions in this time. Our government was not a democracy. Our government was never established to be a democracy. It was established be a Republican form of government. That is, that we elected representatives who would represent us. And that’s why the Senate of the United States was never to be elected by direct election, but was to be appointed by the State. That’s why we still have something most people think is an anachronism -- and it is not -- the Electoral College; because we would get 535 people together who would know the President best, and they would cast the votes for the President, so that the public officials were somehow removed from the passions of the masses. And they would not rule by poll and focus groups. But they would have a sense of nobility and that they would therefore be able to do what was in the best interests of "the people," not necessarily what the poll told them on that particular given day the people wanted.

We’ve totally abandoned that notion -- given up on the idea that our public officials should be men, as [Benjamin] Franklin put it, and women of wisdom and character -- and "virtue" was the phrase. Our Founding Fathers presupposed that our leaders would be people of virtue because that’s the only way self government could possibly survive; otherwise you would need police to enforce everything. Adams said that our Constitution was made only for a religious people. For any other kind, it would be considered wholly inadequate.

Why has this happened? Number one, in our culture we have witnessed in the last thirty years the systematic erosion of a belief in truth. If you take one thing away with your degree today, you should take away an understanding that there is absolute truth, even though 72% of the American people say there is no such thing. There is absolute truth because Jesus Christ said, “I am the Truth.” There is ultimate reality. God has created us. He has spoken. There is a known physical order. There is a known moral order; because God has created it, even in a society which says there is no such thing. It’s true; there is.

And if there’s truth, you have the capacity to know what is right and what is wrong. And if you can’t define what is right and wrong in a culture, you are headed for the kind of moral nihilism we’re experiencing today. Samuel Johnson, the great British writer, once said when he was told a guest was coming to dinner who believed that morality was a sham, he said -- he roared back -- he said, “If he believes there's no difference between virtue and vice, let us count the spoons before he leaves.” Trouble is students are buying this stuff. Chronicles [sic] of Higher Education reports the most terrifying things that students say when they’re asked about whether something is absolutely right or not, including an article I read recently, in which one writer called it absolute phobia, absolute-a-phobia -- that the students could not say categorically that Nazis atrocities were wrong.

We’ve come that far in a relativistic culture. We’ve begun to confuse celebrity and fame with virtue, so that there’s no difference between a Dennis Rodman and a Reggie White. There’s no difference between somebody who gives all of his money to the poor, as Reggie White does, and tries to help people who are in need -- and someone who makes a complete fool of himself as a public spectacle. Fame is fame. And we’ve lost the distinction between vice and virtue. We’ve raised a generation without conscience, which is why in the work that I do in the prisons I travel from place to place and I see people say that --I see these kids, and I see them say, "There is no right and wrong!" And then I see their cold eyes. And then I understand why Jonesboro happened, and why Paducah happened, and why here in Pittsburgh not so many days ago, a student walked in and shot his teacher. And then I understand why students, kids, up in Central Park in New York cut somebody apart in the middle of the night that they stumbled onto, and they disemboweled him, and they disfigured his face. And people say, "Well that was poverty" or "minority." Nonsense. They were all white kids and they were all from an upper middle class in New York, an upper middle class family. Don’t tell me that. It’s because we haven’t instilled conscience in people, because we have abandoned virtue and we’ve said character doesn’t matter. And these kids are beginning to believe it.

The third thing we’ve done, which is appalling, is that we have basically said that "what we do with our bodies" -- I want you to think about it -- "what we do with our bodies has nothing to do with our real self." In the last thirty years, we've embarked upon an experiment in this country, largely fueled by the sexual revolution and the idea that a sexual privilege and right is the highest enshrined constitutionally-protected right in our culture. And we’ve said what we do with our bodies has nothing to do with our real self. It’s a modern form of dualism. We have separated what every culture has believed, what the Christian knows to be body, mind, and spirit being one -- and we’ve said that the body is simply an instrument. We can use it any way we want. The Christian doctrine is totally opposite of that. It says the body is part of us and so valuable to God that it will be resurrected on that great day when he returns and raises us from dead. It is so vital that marriage is considered a covenant relationship in which two bodies come together and make one flesh. And we’ve abandoned that: We say that the body is like an automobile: I can get in it and drive it and take it anyplace I want and use it for pleasure and simply do anything I want. It’s the absolute destruction. The problem is that is how we dis-integrate individuals. Because we disintegrate mind, body, and spirit. And you disintegrate that -- disintegrated people cannot form integrated relationships toward others. Disintegrated people create disintegrated societies, precisely what we have done.

What is integrity? Integrity is wholeness. Any of you in the crowd ever been on the Navy? You’ve been aboard a Naval ship? You know what happens when that ship takes off? I see some hands going up. But someone goes up to the captain on the bridge -- the captain on the bridge says check for watertight integrity. And someone goes down through the ship and they check every single door to see that every door, every waterproof door, is sealed. And they go back up and they say, "The ship has integrity." Integrity means every part of your body. It does not mean every part of your life. It means every single part of your existence. All those water tight doors are shut tight. And then there is integrity. You cannot say that someone can do something on the private side of their lives without it having public consequences, because you’ve opened one of those watertight doors and that ship will eventually sink. A cheat in private is going to be a cheat in public. Someone who lies in private is going to lie in public, and you can’t trust someone who does that.

I want to leave you with a thought, which I guess today is a radical thought. One would never think we would reach the point in America where this would be a radical thought. I want you to go out of here not only being educated men and women who have been privileged, privileged to have one of the great educations you can receive from one of the great institutions in America, one which has it’s roots deep in 150 years of proud tradition of service to God and the country, which cares about the quality of education. But I want you to go out of here not only people who are educated, but people who are going to strive all of your life for integrity and character and purity and virtue and that you’re going to make a difference in your lives by the moral examples that you set. Who would have thought that had to be necessary to say? It ought to be in your families. It ought to be in your businesses. It ought to be in all of the relationships of your life.

I was a marine officer. When you’re trying to go into combat, the most important thing is that the fellow in the next foxhole you can depend on to be there if the shooting begins. I cared a whole lot more about his character than I did his IQ, because my life depended on his character. And as you go through life, whether it’s in the military, or whether it’s in your businesses, or whether it’s in your churches, or whatever walk of life, and certainly in your family, someone is gonna to depend more on your character than your IQ.

Build and develop your character.

How do you do it?

It’s essential; it's essential to freedom.

Well, we all have the greatest message of all: "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much." "Respect others." Speak the truth. Simply "let your 'yes' be yes" -- your "'no', no." Act justly. "Do justly." "Love mercy." "Walk humbly with your God." "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things." "Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." "Who may live on your holy hill? "He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous; who speaks the truth from his heart and has no slander on his tongue; who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellow man; who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the Lord; who keeps his oath, his word," even when it hurts. "Stop doing wrong." "Learn to do right." "Seek justice." "Encourage the oppressed." "Defend the cause of the fatherless." "Plead the cause of the widow."

C.S. Lewis, born a hundred years ago this year -- C.S. Lewis wrote with prophetic insight into what was happening into American culture and western culture. He said this in a book which we wrote in the 40s, in an article called, The Poison of Subjectivism: “The very idea of freedom presupposes some objective moral law which overarches rulers and rules alike. Subjectivism about values is eternally incompatible with democracy. We and our rulers are of one kind only so long as we are subject to one law. But if there is no Law of Nature, the ethos of any society is the creation of its rulers, educators" -- and a wonderful word he uses -- "conditioners. Unless we return to the crude and nursery-like belief in objective values, we perish.”

My single message to you today, as you depart this great institution: Do your duty.

Twenty-five years ago this summer, I was converted to Christ. And everyday that I get up in the morning, I thank God for that moment when I realized my own sin, and I knew that as an historical fact, the son of God went to the cross and took upon himself my sin.

Twenty-five years ago, in the darkest days of Watergate, you read about all of my sins -- those of you graduating now. Younger students at least read about them in your history books. I am always appalled when people come up to me and ask for my autograph on airplanes because they read about me in their history book.

But what I realized that night, twenty-five years ago, the toughest of the Nixon tough guys, the Whitehouse "Hatchet Man," was that it was true that I could be set free, and I realized what was in my heart -- not the stuff you read about in Watergate, but much worse.

And I tell you I would suffocate in the stench of my own sins today if I did not know that Christ took them away.

And what does that do with me?

That inspires in me what Chesterton said is the "mother of all virtues." That inspires in me a sense of gratitude that I will do for my God whatever He calls me to do. And what he calls us to do is to live for him in biblical fidelity to the kinds of commands I read to you from the Holy Scriptures, and to be men and women of character who exalt virtue and go into a society which has disdained character, which is laughing at honor, which is mocking virtue, and saying, "No, we believe in truth, and we’re going to live our lives that way no matter what the cost. Be those kind of men and women.

God Bless you.

It is a great honor and pleasure to be invited today to share this happy occasion, not only with the members of the graduating class of 1998, but also with the families and friends who have no doubt supported you along the way with their kind words of advice and encouragement. I do remember sitting where you sat this morning, when I was part of the class of 1968. I still remember how uncertain and insecure I felt but how proud my father was on the day. I called my father recently and told him that I would be coming here today and giving this address and that it would bring back memories. And being a good west-of-Ireland man, he remembered the important part. "It was damn wet," he reminded me. "It poured all day," which was true. The class of 1998 has been much luckier with the weather--a bit of wind, a bit cool. I put on the gown this afternoon because I thought I'd need it--a bit of frisson in the air. But also I feel reinvigorated, because now, along with eight other very distinguished honorary graduates, I'm a member of the class of 1998, and I can come back in 30 years' time and feel quite young. All in all, it is a very special occasion, and I think it's appropriate that I would salute all of those have returned for your graduation years, particularly the threes and the eights. It was wonderful to see you file past coming in here this afternoon. But I think you can understand if I particularly want to focus on and to address my words to the class of 1998 because you are the future, you are those who take on the particular responsibility for the shaping of our society and of our world. Your families and your professors are rightfully proud of your achievements and they are delighted to see you graduate with futures so bright with promise.

I too am proud. I was very impressed with the three addresses we heard this morning, one in Latin and two in English. And if that's indicative of the class of 1998, then it's good to hear. I'm proud to see so many capable young men and women about to embark on a future career where they can put their years of learning and preparation to good use. Having passed through the rigors of a formal education, you are now ready to assume new responsibilities and tasks, becoming answerable only to yourselves with regards to your performance, your humanity and your soundness of judgement, in a world full of possibilities.

But I would ask you to remember that it's not a world full of possibilities for all. Each of you has been the beneficiary of a rare privilege. You have received an exceptional education at an exceptional place when there are many, in both your country and mine, and in many, many other parts of our world, who are just as innately talented and just as ambitious as you are but will never have such an opportunity. I say this not to make you feel guilty. You should be proud of what you have achieved. But I do ask that you use your education to pursue only the worthiest of goals; goals that contribute to the betterment of the lives of others; and goals that give you personal satisfaction because of their contribution to the society we live in.

1998 is an important year for goals and an important year for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It is a year when we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You will notice that I do not use the word "celebrate". I think we don't celebrate; we mark in a somber and reflective way the fiftieth anniversary. It is a year when we re-affirm our commitment to work for change and to demonstrate that the principles of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration are not too theoretical, nor too abstract. We must all set ourselves the goal of giving such principles practical effect and the success of our efforts can only be measured by the improved well being of individuals around the world.

The Universal Declaration was the first international agreement aimed at the improvement of all human rights for all people. It was a document shaped and generated to a large extent by the vision of a truly inspiring woman from the United States. A woman who had committed her life to worthy goals and who, although extremely shy, made herself a powerful voice on behalf of a wide range of social causes, not least the cause of improving the treatment of women. The woman was, of course, Eleanor Roosevelt who, as the US representative to the UN Commission on Human Rights and later as its Chairperson, was largely responsible for the Universal Declaration.

Unlike the other members of the Commission, Mrs. Roosevelt was neither a scholar nor an expert on international law. She wasn't an academic and she wasn't a jurist, but what she did have was an incredible sense of commitment and compassion. She saw herself as an ambassador for the common man and woman, and her enthusiasm for this goal, combined with her humanitarian convictions, resulted in a Declaration that was direct and straight-forward, and a Declaration that has endured as a universally accepted standard of achievement for all people and all nations. It was adopted on the tenth of December, 1948. It is as relevant now as when it was written.. It's a living document--it's written in the present tense. It was written by people with vision.

Fifty years ago was of course "no ordinary time," as quite a number of you sitting here near the front will recall. The devastation of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust made nations more willing to commit to a universal standard of human rights protections. But in times such as these, when we've become concerned about a lack of sufficient will, it is also worth remembering that throughout the war period, Eleanor Roosevelt worked tirelessly for the human rights of the ordinary men and women in America, reminding us that no matter how hard the going gets, we must not sacrifice human rights for other goals.

For Mrs. Roosevelt, all human rights were universal since every man, woman, and child sought equal justice, equal opportunity, and equal dignity without discrimination. But if rights didn't have meaning locally, in the factory, farm, or office, Mrs. Roosevelt thought they would have little meaning elsewhere and she warned that: "Without concerned citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain at progress in the larger world."

The Declaration's fiftieth anniversary is an ideal time to assess whether we are upholding human rights close to home as well as further afield. As part of the follow-up to the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights of 1993, the United Nations system and its member-states are undergoing a yearlong assessment of its successes and shortcomings with respect to the protection and promotion of human rights. Human Rights organizations and concerned individuals play an important role in that assessment: encouraging discussion and debate on the continuing relevance of the international human rights standards and pointing to areas of imbalance in protection.

One such area is the promotion at the international level of economic, social, and cultural rights and the right to development. Extreme poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, and the vulnerability of children to exploitation are all areas requiring much greater effort. Economic and social rights are in every sense interdependent with civil and political rights. I find it interesting that since I took up my responsibilities as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last September, because I've placed a lot of emphasis on having a better balance and having more focus and attention on economic and social rights, some people have said, "Is she not strong on civil and political rights? Is she not clear about torture and disappearances and imprisonment and prison conditions and so on?" But in fact it's because I'm so strong on civil and political rights that I recognize you cannot truly advance them unless you're also prepared to advance strongly economic and social rights. And that's a big challenge for this great country, a very big challenge right now.

As High Commissioner for Human Rights, I draw strength from being part of an incredible and broad human rights community, a community which encompasses both organizations and individuals, and which represents all cultures, traditions and backgrounds. And I think I particularly ask the class of 1998, and indeed other years who have come back for their graduation, to join the efforts of the human rights community by committing yourselves to the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration, the opening lines of which recognize the inherent dignity and equality of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. I also urge you to take part in the human rights debate so that through informed and purposeful discussion we can achieve a greater understanding of how the rights enshrined in the Declaration can be implemented at both the local and international level.

I'd like to draw on the address of President Rudenstine. He was in fact precisely conveying that message--the importance of using the resources, the intellectual resources that this great University represents, and to bring them to the issues that confront all of our societies an dour global village. The motto of the fiftieth anniversary, "All human rights for all," expresses what we must commit ourselves to achieving in the years ahead. It is evident that in many parts of the world, there is little cause for celebration--far from it. At the end of January, while in Cambodia, I visited a shelter in Phnom Pen for women who had been victims of trafficking for the sex trade. I sat in a small room and listened to a 15-year-old girl who explained, through an interpreter, that friends of her family had driven her to the city as she thought to take up a job in a clothing factory. Instead, she was forced in the door of a sex brothel where she was beaten until she complied for 16 or 17 hours a day with what was required of her. She managed to escape after three months and she was trying to rebuild her sense of herself. She was ashamed, she felt humiliated. As I looked into her eyes I was aware that she wasn't alone in her misery; that millions of children and women, worldwide, endure a similar fate. There is a trafficking in human persons. It's modern slavery. The rights for far too many remain little more than words on paper. However, I do believe that we should commit ourselves to focusing on the future, reinvigorating the common will and commitment of the international community to ensuring the enjoyment of human rights by people everywhere. We are all the custodians of human rights and we must all find our own way to do what is required.

I thought it fitting, somehow, coming here to Harvard, that I should remind you of some lines of Seamus Heaney's poem "From the Republic of Conscience." I didn't know when I was preparing this address who would be honored with me--Harvard kept the secret well. I didn't know that Seamus Heaney was going to be here or I would have found another worthy Irish poet to quote. But it's too late now, and somehow I think his words do enhance what I'm trying to say, so close your ears, Seamus, and I'll do my best. These words are part of the poem, "From the Republic of Conscience."

"...you carried what you had to and very soon 
your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared..."

"...I came back from that frugal republic 
with my two arms the one length, the customs woman 
having insisted my allowance was myself.

The old man rose and gazed into my face 
and said that was official recognition 
that I was now a dual citizen.

Their embassies, he said, were everywhere 
but operated independently 
and no ambassador would ever be relieved."

You who graduate today, and you who are recent and not so recent graduates, who return to meet your Harvard friends again, can, I believe, do much to contribute to the betterment of society. You can become interested and involved in the world around you. By virtue of your education, you can offer society the benefit of your focused knowledge, as well as a wider vision and a great sense of purpose. You also have the skills to teach others to be more tolerant, more understanding and more caring, and I'm confident that your recognition of this special responsibility will guide your actions and perhaps one day--and I think I saw some potential candidates--inspire a future Eleanor Roosevelt.

I wish you much happiness and success in the years ahead. May your memories of Harvard, as mine are, and the friends you have made here be with you always. Congratulations, new graduates, and I am very honored to be linked with the honored graduates up here of 1998 and to be rejuvenated by joining the class of 1998. Thank you very much.

I am touched. I look at you 2,045 graduates who celebrate today. Your families and your parents are so proud of your achievements. I know, because when we walked through for the procession, I saw so many smiling faces, and so many proud faces. You have worked hard, and you're entitled. You have many challenges and triumphs ahead, because your adventure is just beginning.

Cleveland and Case Western have a great meaning to me. My father graduated from the dental school here, my uncle from the medical school here, my sister from Flora Stone Mather College, and I attended Flora Stone Mather College also. So it is really thrilling for me to speak to you and to share today with you. Over 40 years ago, I left Cleveland with $500 and a used Studebaker. I came to New York expecting to stay several months and then return to Cleveland, but as fate would have it, I applied to the UN for a job because my cousin was one of our ambassadors, and I was turned down because I did not have fluency in two languages. I applied to Bache and Company, and after a test they offered me $65 as trainee in research, and $75 a week in accounting. I took the research, the $65 a week, because it challenged me, it made me use my accounting abilities.

And frankly, I was lucky. They were expanding their research department, and the analyst who had railroads, shipping, buses, airlines, trucks -- everything that moved -- gave me the airlines. The analyst who had chemicals and drugs also had radio, television, motion pictures. He thought that those industries were going nowhere, so he dumped them on me. I was lucky. I realized the value of the totally depreciated films for television, and I wrote the first study on the value of those films.

Two years later, I got my first order. I was not registered, I was not allowed to take orders. But Madison Fund called me, and they said, "We made money on a report that you wrote, we owe you an order." So I went up to the partner in charge of research, and I said, "Shall I go up and get the order, or shall I wait until I get registered." The research partner practically shoved me out of his office. He said, "Go up there and get the order, and we'll make it up to you at Christmas time." Well, that jump-started my career.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about the differences, the similarities, the opportunities and challenges when I left Cleveland and those of today. Some of the challenges we faced have been met. There are current ones that are obvious today, and new ones will develop tomorrow. Wall Street, when I joined it, was almost exclusively white males.

Some of the things that happened no longer exist. For example, women were paid less than men. I changed jobs twice because I was being paid $13,000 a year and the men doing the same work were being paid $20,000. And you know, that difference, when you have that amount of money, represents the difference of a quality of life -- the ability to take vacations, buy a new car, et cetera.

At that time, women were not allowed in the luncheon clubs of the major Wall Street clubs. If a company gave a meeting, a session, where they explained their products, they had to send a man. I was not allowed in it. At that time, women were not allowed to travel out of town on business.

I once applied for a job at a major Wall Street banking firm, and I was told, "We have never had a woman higher than a secretary, and if we hire you, you will have to wear a hat and white gloves in the elevators." Once upon a time, when I wanted to change jobs, I sent a resume out with my full name. I didn't get one response. The New York Society of Security Analysts had a job placement bureau. They sent the same resume out with just my initials. I got an interview and a job.

Even as recent as when I bought my seat on the New York Stock Exchange 30 years ago, when I made the Stock Exchange co-ed, it appeared on the front page of leading newspapers around the country. They had never had a woman member before because there was no ladies' room on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. I had more people concerned about my toilet habits. Actually, there was a ladies' room on the floor, but no one told me about it for two years.

Subsequently I became a director of the Sales Executives Club, and we had our board meeting on the second floor of the Union League Club. I went up to the elevators, and they would not let me in the elevator. So I had to walk through the kitchen and up the stairs with the waiters. The men in the meeting saw how angry I was, so afterwards they said, "Come with us to the elevators." Well, they wouldn't let them in the elevator with me, so they walked down the stairs and through the kitchen with me and the waiters. There is both good news today and both bad news today. The bad news is that because other women and I introduced so many firsts, there just aren't that many firsts around for you for tomorrow. The good news is that many more opportunities now abound.

Women-owned businesses now employ one out of four workers in the United States. We employ 130 percent of what the Fortune 500 employs globally. We generate over $2.3 trillion of revenues every year. Forty years ago, we owned beauty shops or small retail stores, so things have changed. Today we own all types of businesses, and the fastest-growing ones are those in construction, trucking, and not the traditional female companies.

Technology has changed the world, and its importance in our lives is accelerating. On one hand, it will create wonderful opportunities, and on the other hand, it will change the way we conduct business and our personal lives in the years ahead. Just think about it -- people are telecommuting. They are working from their home now, with just a computer and a modem. This didn't happen years ago. And when we thought of Europe, we thought of a place for a great vacation. Paris, Rome, London, the museums. Today, when we think of Europe, we look at the European Union which is currently under way, and the creation of the common currency for Europe, the Euro. We see economic opportunities as well as negative factors that could develop from this unity that is happening.

The world today is not just the Unites States. It is truly a global economy. We are interconnected and interdependent. Instant global communications have revolutionized many countries. For example, let's look at Asia. Some of those countries went from no telephone system to cellular phones and computerized callings. They bypassed the traditional phone systems as we know them.

Computers, for example, have changed the way we work and live. At my firm, when I bought my seat on the exchange, if someone gave me an order, I wrote out the order ticket. I either called the order down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange or I took it to an order clerk, who called it down to the floor. The clerk wrote out the order ticket, gave it to a two dollar broker who had to be a member of the New York Stock Exchange, who took it to the specialists post, said "How is General Motors," bought or sold the stock, and repeated the whole process back. Today, my brokers in the discount business will take a telephone call from a customer, we type it on the screen -- the name, the account number, what the customer wants to do. It automatically goes down to the post electronically, where that stock is traded, the order is filled, and it is back within two or three seconds -- totally untouched. That's what has happened, and that has been a true revolution.

Ten years ago, we introduced touch-tone orders, where you can place orders using your touch-tone telephone. Three years ago, it was orders by way of a PC. Today we have Internet trading, where no hands touch it. It has totally revolutionized facets of our industry.

Biotech, for example, is just starting to enter a new phase which will eliminate many of the diseases we have seen in our parents and grandparents, just as polio was eliminated during my period. Developments in biotech will change both the quality and quantity of our lives.

But just because today you receive your degree which you have worked very hard for, don't think that's all you need. You need to stay focused on what's important to you. Don't give up.

Let me give you an example by telling you a little story about my first car, the one that brought me to New York from Cleveland, Ohio. Did you ever hear the name Studebaker? Well, that was the car, and it was really something. It wasn't flashy or expensive, and it wasn't very fast or dashing, and it really didn't have a lot of style. So what was important about this car? What was special about this car was that it taught me. It taught me how to deal with obstacles, problems, and life. That darned car door would never open right -- it would always stick. I'd pull it, I'd cajole it, I'd shake it, I'd even plead with it. There were times I swore at it. Finally, I learned, I just had to kick it. And you know what? That is the real lesson that old Studebaker taught me. When a door is hard to open, and if nothing else works, sometimes you just have to rear back and kick it open.

Here are a few other lessons from the battlefield. First, you must keep learning. You have learned great technical skills, but you must keep them current. You and thousands of other women and men are entering the work force, armed with your degrees. You all begin on a level playing field. You keep it level depending on what you do with that degree and how you build upon it. Regardless of the path you choose, you cannot stop learning. You cannot stop developing and adding to your skills.

Technology will continue to march ahead, with or without you. I've been on Wall Street for over 40 years. If someone had told me even five years ago that I'd have a computer on my desk and actually use it every day, I would have laughed. Technology is changing everything, and that will not stop. Make technology your friend. Use it. Otherwise it will be your enemy.

But I also recommend that you keep your other skills sharp and current. Learn finance. Watch closely global economics. And know how to write and talk and read and listen.

Next, know the more that you succeed, the more you will be challenged. Many think that the biggest battle I had to fight was to buy my seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Yes, that was a battle, but that only got me into the game.

I was also a beneficiary of the women's movement. I never worked for Governor Carey, I never donated money to him, but I got a call one day, and he said, "I have made a promise to hire women for my administration, and I would like you as superintendent of banks." So along that process, I got a call from one of the reporters, who said, "Do you think a woman is qualified to be superintendent of banks?" So I said, pausing a little bit, "Yes, I think I'm qualified, because the initials for 'superintendent of banks' are ...," and I just laughed.

I will also tell you that I got a call from a friend of mine who was head of research at one of the major trust departments of a major bank. And he called, and he said, "Mickie, I was just called into the chairman's office. I don't get called into the chairman's office regularly." And he said to me, "I understand that they are going to appoint a woman She is not a lawyer, and she's Jewish." He says, "What do I tell them?" I said, "Tell him the truth -- he's right on all three." Well, those policies, this would not happen today, in my opinion. Many of those policies and prejudices are no longer there, thanks to our new awareness that prejudice is not only ethically wrong, but it's economically stupid.

Keep an open mind, an inquisitive mind. Learn from your successes. Learn from your failures. It's OK to make a mistake, but you are not entitled to make the same mistake twice.

Most of you will have challenging careers. Try to be as smart or smarter than anyone else. My discount brokerage business is national. We serve over 80,000 customers. In the scheme of things, we are really small. We're a peanut. But I'm able to compete, not because I'm the biggest. But we try to stay one step ahead in technology, products, and customer service. Whether you are running a department, leading a team, or responsible for managing a project or a classroom, it is your obligation and your privilege to be as good as you can be. At least, do all you can to do your best. Do your homework all of your life.

When regulations changed in 1975, I changed the operations of my research firm to a discount brokerage company because I realized that when you change laws and regulations, there are always new opportunities, and that's when discount brokerage was invented. Two years ago, it came across the broad tape that someone I knew resigned from his own firm. He owned 70 percent of the largest black-owned firm in the municipal bond business. And they are smart people. So I realized the firm could not make it without Calvin Grigsby. So I called his two partners, Suzanne Shank and Napoleon Brandford, and we have built Siebert Branford Shank, where they own 51 percent, and we have a very successful municipal bond underwriting operation. I hadn't planned to do that, but when I saw the opportunity, I realized that it was good business and it was also the right thing to do. I don't like to brag much, but I will. Last year, we underwrote -- senior managed, which meant we ran the books and priced the deal -- $250 million for Detroit Water. And under us was Goldman, Sachs; Lehman Brothers; Paine Webber; and Prudential Bache. Two months ago, we underwrote $200 million for the State of California, and under us was Bear Stearns and Morgan Guarantee. The bank that wouldn't make me the loan for the seat was under us for underwriting -- and that's important.

But at the end of the day, the reason that corporations or municipalities trust my firm to sell millions of dollars of securities is, we may be small, but we know how to do it as well as major firms. You don't have to be the biggest -- just the best. Institutions give us large orders because they trust us. I'll tell you something. Competence has no gender. Brains have no sex nor color. Just remember that. We are in business where I have traded control of companies and had absolutely nothing in writing. Our writing is our bond, and so it should be for you. Finally, give something back. See yourself as part of a larger community and join in. My firm has two charitable programs -- SEPP, which is the Siebert Entrepreneurial Philanthropic Program, where we share revenues on certain business we do, and we've donated over $5 million to date. And we also handle the sale of stock received by nonprofit organizations or institutions on a pro bono basis -- we do not charge them. Nothing in my years of fighting and winning battles has come close to feeling as good as giving something back. We all owe it to each other.

You know, life is a very serious game. When you see a challenge, reach for it, grab it, and do it. And if you don't succeed, pick yourself up and try again.

I've been talking to you about what I've learned that I think has value for you. I'd like to close with another thought. Today's economic and social problems are profound. Resources are scarce. Our institutions -- educational, government, philanthropic -- are being challenged as never before. This world needs new talent and a continued dedication to a higher standard of human dignity. You will be asked to solve tremendously complex business and social problems, both here and globally. For the sake of all of us, please try. I'll close by giving you a challenge -- when you hit a closed door and it doesn't open easily, don't get discouraged. Just remember my Studebaker. When all else fails, just rear back and kick the door open. But don't do it just for yourself -- do it also for those who follow you.

Thank you very much for allowing me to share this wonderful day with you.

Members of the class of 1998: In an effort to alter history, I would like to give you students a commencement speech that is both memorable and useful. It consists of a list of jobs that are readily available to young college graduates, but are rarely , if ever, considered to be within their reach. The mistake made by most of you is that you aim too low - assistants to administrative assistants and the like - whereas the positions I am about to describe are not only exalted and high paying; they also require little or no work, experience, training or knowledge. Thus they are exceptionally well suited to graduating seniors. Here, then, is a sort of ‘unclassifieds’ of exciting opportunities waiting for you:

President of the United States. This job is often avoided by students because it necessitates living in Washington and has an age requirement. But the position is very worthwhile. Recent grads would make excellent U.S. Presidents because they usually are single, and can get into less trouble than a married President. The “work” does not require that one have been President of some other place, like China. And it lasts eight years at most, after which you’ll have plenty of time for golf and dating. Perks include free food, you own seal, protection by the Secret Service (when they’re not out testifying), and a loyal staff, consisting of such people as Dick Morris and Linda Tripp.

Drug Czar. A most enjoyable and relaxing job, it has the added distinction of being the only government post named for a Russian. Its best feature is that while it requires no effort, it also demands no successes. As drug czar all you need to do is claim, every few months, that you are eradicating the nation’s drug problem. Everyone will understand that you’re kidding. The person who accomplished the least in this position, and was therefore the most successful, was William Bennett, who was equally successful as Secretary of Education, an office that he recommended be abolished once he left it. Mr. Bennett is currently the spokesperson for national morality.

Spokesperson. It’s easy. I’s fun. And it could be you! Simply find someone in the news, preferably under indictment, and do all his/her public speaking. In no time, you will be that someone in the news. Then you can hire a spokesperson. Infinite possibilities.

Expert Expert. When an individual mishap occurs, and the press wishes to suggest that it signifies a national epidemic, who they gonna’ call? As a expert expert, simply be prepared to show up on TV and warn the public about the ‘lessons’ of everything from frostbite to shark attacks. Make something out of nothing! Offer solutions! Create jobs for others!

Historian. You probably think that becoming a historian demands a Ph.D. and long study, but today anyone may be so designated if he/she remembers anything. Recent grads may become historians if they, say remember the ’80s. You can appear on your own cable channel, and rake in big fees on the lecture circuit. But you will have the most fun simply making up history. Who will correct you? Did somebody say ‘Professor’?

Talk-Show Host. (See President of the United States.)

Celine Dion. Claim to be Celine Dion. She’s everywhere, so who’ll know? Only requirement is that you sing the love song from Titanic all year. Your career will go on and on.

Plagiarist. Talk about easy! Why write your own material when others have done it for you? With careful choices, a good plagiarist can produce dozens of articles or books a year and make a fortune. Don’t worry about being caught. If you have to apologize, just say, ‘An error was made.’ Nobody cares.

Media Critic. Now here’s a job you can do at home. You don’t even need to have been a model member of the media to criticize them (see Plagiarist), and many find they are better at it in inverse proportion to their abilities. The ‘work’ is not only easy but also exclusive; no one but members of the media will pay attention! With luck you can join the faculty of a journalism school and take a whole year ‘teaching’ a ‘subject’ that a slow 12 year-old could pick up in three weeks.

Publishing Giant. As long as you don’t hold the fuddy-duddy notion of books as literature, you can be a publishing giant (and be invited to all the best parties!) without lifting a finger. Simply sign up a major criminal or disgraced public figure to a lucrative book contract. That’s it! You don’t even need to produce the book. Who’ll notice? Eventually you may be fired, but think of all the celebrities you’ll rub elbows with. And you can always become a media critic or historian.

Celebrity Lawyer. Time was when new law-school grads had to suffer years of obscurity laboring in the stacks of some stuffy firm. Now you can go straight to TV and be rich and famous instantly. Just be sure to shout, interrupt and call your opponents idiots. Do not expect to achieve the charm or personal appeal of a Alan Dershowitz or a Marcia Lark right away. But in a very short time you’ll be building a name for yourself and a clientele! Why chase ambulances when the ambulance can come to you?

There you go. Congratulations and good luck. Remember: there’s a great country out there. Take it.

I am so smart I know what is wrong with the world. Everybody asks during and after our wars, and the continuing terrorist attacks all over the globe, “What’s gone wrong?” What has gone wrong is that too many people, including high school kids and heads of state, are obeying the Code of Hammurabi, a King of Babylonia who lived nearly four thousand years ago. And you can find his code echoed in the Old Testament, too. Are you ready for this?

“An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”

A categorical imperative for all who live in obedience to the Code of Hammurabi, which includes heroes of every cowboy show and gangster show you ever saw, is this: Every injury, real or imagined, shall be avenged. Somebody’s going to be really sorry.

When Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross, he said, “Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.” What kind of a man was that? Any real man, obeying the Code of Hammurabi, would have said, “Kill them, Dad, and all their friends and relatives, and make their deaths slow and painful.”

His greatest legacy to us, in my humble opinion, consists of only twelve words. They are the antidote to the poison of the Code of Hammurabi, a formula almost as compact as Albert Einstein’s “E = mc2.

I am a Humanist, or Freethinker, as were my parents and grandparents and great grandparents — and so not a Christian. By being a Humanist, I am honoring my mother and father, which the Bible tells us is a good thing to do.

But I say with all my American ancestors, “If what Jesus said was good, and so much of it was absolutely beautiful, what does it matter if he was God or not?”

If Christ hadn’t delivered the Sermon on the Mount, with its message of mercy and pity, I wouldn’t want to be a human being.

I would just as soon be a rattlesnake.

Revenge provokes revenge which provokes revenge which provokes revenge — forming an unbroken chain of death and destruction linking nations of today to barbarous tribes of thousands and thousands of years ago.

We may never dissuade leaders of our nation or any other nation from responding vengefully, violently, to every insult or injury. In this, the Age of Television, they will continue to find irresistible the temptation to become entertainers, to compete with movies by blowing up bridges and police stations and factories and so on…

But in our personal lives, our inner lives, at least, we can learn to live without the sick excitement, without the kick of having scores to settle with this particular person, or that bunch of people, or that particular institution or race or nation. And we can then reasonably ask forgiveness for our trespasses, since we forgive those who trespass against us. And we can teach our children and then our grandchildren to do the same — so that they, too, can never be a threat to anyone.

A woman’s reach should exceed her grasp, or what’s a heaven for?

You should know that when a husband and wife fight, it may seem to be about money or sex or power.

But what they’re really yelling at each other about is loneliness. What they’re really saying is, “You’re not enough people.”

If you determine that that really is what they’ve been yelling at each other about, tell them to become more people for each other by joining a synthetic extended family — like the Hell’s Angels, perhaps, or the American Humanist Association, with headquarters in Amherst, New York — or the nearest church.

Computers are no more your friends, and no more increasers of your brainpower, than slot machines…

Only well-informed, warm-hearted people can teach others things they’ll always remember and love. Computers and TV don’t do that.

A computer teaches a child what a computer can become.

An educated human being teaches a child what a child can become. Bad men just want your bodies. TVs and computers want your money, which is even more disgusting. It’s so much more dehumanizing!

By working so hard at becoming wise and reasonable and well-informed, you have made our little planet, our precious little moist, blue-green ball, a saner place than it was before you got here.

Most of you are preparing to enter fields unattractive to greedy persons, such as education and the healing arts. Teaching, may I say, is the noblest profession of all in a democracy.

One of the things [Uncle Alex] found objectionable about human beings was that they so rarely noticed it when they were happy. He himself did his best to acknowledge it when times were sweet. We could be drinking lemonade in the shade of an apple tree in the summertime, and Uncle Alex would interrupt the conversation to say, “If this isn’t nice, what is?”

So I hope that you will do the same for the rest of your lives. When things are going sweetly and peacefully, please pause a moment, and then say out loud, “If this isn’t nice, what is?”

That’s one favor I’ve asked of you. Now I ask for another one. I ask it not only of the graduates, but of everyone here, parents and teachers as well. I’ll want a show of hands after I ask this question.

How many of you have had a teacher at any level of your education who made you more excited to be alive, prouder to be alive, than you had previously believed possible?

Hold up your hands, please.

Now take down your hands and say the name of that teacher to someone else and tell them what that teacher did for you.

All done?

If this isn’t nice, what is?

I'll start in the formal traditional way by addressing President Casper and Provost Rice, the trustees and faculty, the honored guests, the graduates and their families and their guests. Thanks a lot for inviting me to come here. I really appreciate it. I call attention to the formality of the traditional beginning of this kind of speech, because one of the things I want to talk to you about today is the question: What are we doing here?

Graduation exercises, like this one, embody one of the great secular rituals in our culture, unique and strange occasions involving funny hats which some here have made funnier and more light-hearted and more individual and more festive with pineapples and inflatable surgical gloves and trees and things I don't know what they are. But you have not succeeded in the making the hats any more strange than they already are. Many of us have traveled great distances to wear these special get-ups, to witness a procession of individuals in these unusual garments whose colors are part of the symbolic code elaborately explained in your program and remembered by almost nobody. We have come to take part in the handing over of special emblematic objects, diplomas, which bear language dimly understood or downright incomprehensible inscribed on unfamiliar materials signed and stamped with seals so formal they're nearly mystical with symbols and mottoes. The hats are like a ritual symbolic surrealist mystery, a symbol flamboyantly representing mystery itself.

By comparison, other secular rituals, like the inauguration of an American president, for example, or the ceremonies of becoming an American citizen, get accomplished with a kind of quick, understated simplicity, more like getting a driver's license than our ceremonies today.

Why do we mark these occasions with such intense degrees of, as the song title is, "Pomp and Circumstance"?

My question is only put the more by the Stanford tradition of doing something a little silly or weird to go along with it. It's another way of putting the same question: What is this?

There are two usual explanations for this remarkable intensity of ceremoniousness. One is that the graduates have worked very hard for their education. Possibly so. Another is that the parents and family have made material sacrifices, sometimes mortgaging homes or taking second jobs in order to pay for the education. There's something in that notion, too. But neither one seems an adequate explanation of these rituals.

On some deeper level, I think that what we see today is the celebration here of the two great obligations or standards, the two great tests that apply to every tribe and culture on earth, the two values by which any human society must be judged. These two measures of any people, of any nation, challenge us Americans at the end of what has been called "the American century" in special ways. These secular rituals and extraordinary gowns and processions invoke those two monumental standards and propose that on this splendid campus in the midst of a prosperous, technologically sophisticated society, which this is in some ways the center, in a richly burgeoning mass culture, we do continue, so these exercises are meant to assert, to fulfill the ancient fundamental purposes of community.

I mean the two great requirements of the human animal, without which human community is corrupt or useless, namely, caring for the young ones and honoring the wisdom of the old ones, including the ways and wisdom of the dead. The tribe or community or nation that fails at either of these missions brings woe and destruction on itself. Today the graduates pass symbolically from being the objects of the first concern, young ones who have been nurtured, to bearing the responsibilities of the second, those who are supposed to care for the young and who will preserve and extend the wisdom of the dead.

Colleges and universities are places where those fundamental activities -- taking care of the offspring, revering the ancestors -- come together in a single effort. Commencement exercises are a sort of transition or meeting place between those two broad purposes. If you come on a tribe that neglects its children or ignores its old ones, you know that some tremendous woe is about to extinguish that people's spirit.

I think that the special outfits and music and titles and diplomas are a kind of prayer that our spirit be healthy, that those missions are still sacred one way or another. And clowning is part of the sacred; clowning is a way of pointing toward the sacred.

I'm going to try to comment on those missions in a specific way that apply to Americans today, and to these graduates, but first let me elaborate the general idea a little bit. Most mammals have to care for their young, but in the famous classical tag, the human animal is an especially puny creature. Its claws are almost useless as weapons. So are its feeble little teeth. Its hide offers only flimsy protection. The pathetic animal can't swim very well. It can't fly at all. It can't jump very high. Its climbing is mediocre and even its most athletic specimens are not very fast, compared to other animals. But we're a clever, observant, busy little monkey. And for survival, we have developed means of communication -- communicating not only horizontally, so the animal can cooperate with its peers in gaining food or shelter, but also vertically with its predecessors and successors so that the experiences of past lifetimes can be applied to make up for our physical weakness.

For this purpose of memory and transmission the animal has devised the binary code of the computer, and before that, printed marks, and before printed marks, incised or written marks, and before the incised or written marks, the creature made a technology out of its own body, notably with the highly refined system of grunts emitted through its feeding orifice. Like the griots in Alex Haley's Roots who could call up across centuries information about dynasties, family relations, property rights, the human animal through this amazing grunt code of speech can retain subtle shades of information -- which food is available at what time of year, what customs for mating or burial best serve a community, information as precise or as subtle as "Get me a pound of galvanized ten-penny nails" or "I love you but not that way."

Mostly we take this process for granted, but not always. I remember when I was in grade school they used to show us movies provided by industrial groups -- "The Story of Glassmaking" or "The Amazing Truth About Paper" -- and these movies had these informative graphic diagrams and vivid scenes showing very complicated machinery pulping paper or making bottles or fiberglass curtains, and also shots of technicians in lab coats working the machinery or developing the processes, making notes on clipboards. And in grade school I used to watch those machines in assembly lines in the movies, those elaborate diagrams of chemical processes, and I used to think to myself: "There's no way kids are going to learn to do this stuff." I felt that when the grownups who worked in those factories and laboratories died, it was all going to fall apart. There would be no more Coke bottles or paper or whatever. "I know these kids," I said to myself. "When it's our turn to manage all this stuff, they're not going to work those machines, where the caps come down on the bottles ten times a second!" I knew in my bones that maybe one or two kids in a hundred had absorbed the diagrams, and none of us could work the machines! It was all going to collapse.

In a way, it is amazing that of course the people in my generation and later did learn to work the machines, and the machines that make the machines, and we not only mastered the process, but extended and improved and supplanted and developed and exceeded what had come before. It still surprises me. Most or all of the people who made those movies about glass or paper or whatever are dead now. Most of those people in those obsolete factories are dead, and those who practice their crafts and professions today honor them in their work, without necessarily thinking about them. Or maybe once in a while they do think about those old ones of glass or paper. I hope they do. In the interest of the community, the community instructs the young in the ways of the past; and if I have one superstition, my superstition is that we had better honor those before us as we hope to be honored by those to whom we pass on our treasures of knowledge and skill.

Maybe the most powerful, even disturbing, statement I know concerning that process of receiving from the old ones to give to the young is the legendary half-mythical speech given by Chief Seattle, the Suquamash Indian leader. In the most authentic of the many versions of Seattle's speech, he recognizes that the white invaders have displaced and conquered his people, reduced now to a remnant who have to rely on the goodwill of the white leaders. His people are a faded, hopeless community now, says Seattle to the conquerors, and soon there may be none left of a people who once were more numerous and hopeful than yours. He muses that the white men have said that their god is the god of the Indians as well, but Seattle says he has to doubt that. Why, if the two peoples have this one father, does he treat the one so much better than the other? And how can we be brothers, he says to the triumphant newcomers, when we're so different.

As his great central example of that difference, Seattle points to how differently the two peoples behave in relation to their dead. He says:

To us the ashes of our ancestors are sacred and their resting place is hallowed ground.

You wander far from the graves of your ancestors and seemingly without regret.

Your dead cease to love you and the land of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of the tomb and wander away beyond the stars.

They are soon forgotten and never return.

"Our dead never forget this beautiful world that gave them being," he says, and he explains that they often return to advise and comfort the living.

This is very smart, cunning rhetoric on Seattle's part, seeming to concede and submit while it defiantly chastises. Then his speech takes a different, rather surprisingly rhetorical turn, musing that despite these differences, on the other hand, he says, all peoples eventually wither and die away; nothing lasts forever. "We may be brothers after all," he says.

"We may be brothers after all" -- brothers in mortality, brothers in the fact that all nations wither. Nothing lasts forever. And then Chief Seattle makes a remarkable statement, a sentence that has rung in my mind since I first read it: "They are not powerless, the dead."

"They are not powerless, the dead." I believe that these famous remarks of Chief Seattle speak to something deep in the nature of the United States of America, as though Seattle intuited something profound about our possibilities and our risks. I associate his saying that the dead are not powerless with the nature of American memory -- our particular national ways of honoring the old ones.

It's been said that while the United States is beyond doubt a great nation, it remains to be seen if we are a great people, or whether we are perhaps still engaged in the undertaking of becoming a great people. I propose to you that a people is defined and unified not by blood, but by shared memory -- a people is held together and identified by what successfully gets passed on from the old ones to be remembered by the young. A people is its memory, its ancestral treasures.

The greatness of our military and political and economic power, the greatness of our technology, are beyond question. And beyond that power and abundance there are our great national documents -- the Constitution with the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence. And beyond those, some of our cultural accomplishments seem unarguably great -- our jazz certainly, our feature films maybe, the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, writing by Cather and Ellison and Faulkner.

But the crucial question is: Who are the people who remember those documents, who are the people who remember the music of Ellington or Parker, the films of Buster Keaton, the poems of Dickinson or Whitman? Am I right in supposing that these are among our sacred shared treasures? Or is the list more uncertain than that, or different from that? Do we or do we not recall our treasures? Do we know what they are, and do we remember them, whatever they may be?

In this country, it's especially evident that a people is defined by memory, not by blood -- more evident than in a country where more of the citizens resemble one another physically. In our country, where we don't all resemble one another quite so much physically, the conscious process of memory, the deciding who we are by what we remember, is more overt and visible because also, relatively speaking, we do without the two great supports of memory in many other cultures. Even our racial division, with its history of injustice, in this context is perhaps only the greatest and most painful example of our still ongoing quest to be a great people. What are the two things that we do without?

On one side, we do not have a single unifying folk culture in which the grandparents all tell the same stories and sing the same songs to the children. The Italian American grandma and the Eastern European grandma and the African American grandma and the Lebanese and Chinese and Southeast Asian grandmas in America all tell somewhat different jokes and tales and sing somewhat different songs. Secondly, on the other extreme, we are relatively without a social class that considers itself the hereditary curators of art. That is, possibly in that imaginary village of President Casper's, that one person with a college degree who says, "I'm well born. My ancestors and I take care of this memory, these things. Somebody else does the folk memory, I do the aristocratic memory." But here, there's relatively little snob value to art. There are countries in the world where politicians must pretend to love the great national poet. In those countries, if a driver is angry at another driver, he yells at him, "You have no culture!"

I submit to you that this is not an American insult.

In the absence of a single folk culture, in the relative absence of the aristocratic notion, where do we Americans get the memory that holds us together as a people? How do we stave off the withering away that's implicit in Chief Seattle's observation that we don't keep our dead with us? How is it that we have managed to hold together as a people? How can we expect to?

One answer is that we're still working on it -- that we have developed a national genius for making it up as we go along. Improvisation characterizes our music, our clothes, our blue jeans, the get-ups that you have on today, the headlong invention and energy of our businesses, our mass entertainment. But the spirit of improvisation alone, though we may be proud of it, it alone cannot sustain the process that transmits the ways of glassmaking and papermaking, or the ways of understanding ourselves across the generations.

A second, perhaps terribly anticlimactic answer to how do we get along without a single folk root, and without a dominant aristocratic ideal, answer can be expressed in one disappointing yet hopeful word: school. In America's public schools and in our colleges and universities -- this particular university improvised by a couple not far out of living memory -- we have improvised some notion of who we are. Or, to be precise, who our old ones are. Who are the dead we keep with us?

My personal favorite example of that process of choosing our old ones is in the writing of the great American essayist W. E. B. DuBois. In a memorable paragraph, where DuBois associates the great works of the past with the spirit of freedom, DuBois writes -- you can tell a good 19th-century prose style by the way he writes, almost in blank verse -- he writes:

I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women glide in gilded halls. From out the caves of evening that swing between the strong-limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all graciously with no scorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, I dwell above the Veil.

You may not have his examples, but you better have examples. Here in his rich 19th-century cadences, DuBois affirms that the care of the old ones and care for their works is a matter of choice and love, not blood. He indicates that culture through its greatest works is a means to individual freedom. In Chief Seattle's terms, DuBois walks with his dead.

To this lofty idea of his, we can add another element of national memory, our popular culture, a realm where the inventions and improvisations of immigrants, a mixing of African and Latin and European and Asian elements have created a fabric of tremendous richness. But it's a peculiarity of this fluid, dynamic popular culture that memory can be very short. Ellington and Keaton, Billie Holiday and Preston Sturges were popular, even mass art not long ago, but within a generation or two, they, too, are taught in school and remembered largely through the work of school. Given this importance of school as curator of American culture, in the absence of those two other repositories, it's no wonder that these commencement exercises are so elaborate, and so overtly laden with symbols and mysteries.

The work of those artists in movies and jazz comes into school, as the best sitcoms and cop shows are coming into school, partly because of the accelerating pace and increasing scale of mass art -- mass art, which perhaps should be distinguished from popular art. Mass art, which can be wonderful and glorious -- I don't mean to disparage it -- is by nature designed and produced by experts, distributed by experts, marketed by experts who hope to make it popular in one specific sense. Popular art, true popular art in a larger sense is produced by a people, distributed by means more like gossip than like marketing campaigns. The mass product of the steel oil drum, the ugly and unpromising object, was made a musical instrument of popular art by people who used it to invent a new music. Then steel drum music was marketed by the organs of mass art, and perhaps some of that product was sampled into a rap tune before rap, in its turn, was transformed from popular art into mass art, perhaps to be made popular art again in a complex American circulation.

I promise to apply my thoughts about honoring our predecessors and caring for our young to this moment, to these particular graduates.

Your generation has experienced mass culture with a special intensity. By the time you were 12 or 13, you had consumed many, many different mass-marketed products, some of them brilliant and wonderful, some less so. As small children you saw the movie and had the illustrated book, and you pleaded for the spin-off products and you got the action figure and the little figures at the fast-food place, and you saw the cartoon version on television on the weekend. By the time you were 14, manipulated so many times, so effectively, you were more than a little jaded or ironic about mass art, sometimes while being nostalgic about it, at the same time. The normal response to these manipulated cultural waves is to sort of lump them and to feel a little disgust with them.

Many of the styles of your generation, in music and dress, as I perceive them, are as if designed to come up with something that resists the mass scale, a kind of grooming or music that won't easily be sold by Sears & Roebuck to 10-year-olds within a few weeks. In this sense, it has occurred to me that the body-pierce shares some roots and motives with the current American resurgence of my own art of poetry, poetry which has become increasingly, well, increasingly popular in recent years. Like certain fashions, like having a piece of steel go through the bridge of your nose or something, poetry seeks to live on an individual human scale. The medium for a poem is one person's voice. So by the nature of the medium, it is a counterweight to mass art.

One of your hallmarks as a generation from my point of view may be an admirable, droll skepticism. You do not want to be too easily sold or too easily sold to, and your presence here today as individuals indicates that you have held out for quality goods and excellent pursuits. The hijinks with the academic garments are in that category. I don't want to overpraise them. I'm aware they can slide off into a kind of languid privileged class arrogance, you know, like kids at community colleges have to take this seriously, we can crap around. I'm aware that there's a balance there. I understand that, and you don't want to become like the upper classes in the Evelyn Waugh novels, where they trash stuff, and he writes, "It was the sound of the English upper classes howling for broken glass." But you can handle that one.

In a way, as a generation, you have reversed the lines I recall from my beloved great teacher here at Stanford, Yvor Winters.

Winters wrote this quatrain in a poem called "On Teaching the Young":

The young are quick of speech. 
Grown middle-aged, I teach 
Corrosion and distrust 
Exacting what I must.

I hope your corrosion and distrust carry you far, and that your resistance and skepticism not prevent you from picking and choosing and walking among the great dead, as W. E. B. DuBois describes.

In relation to the ideas of honoring the old ones and caring for the young, I pray that my own generation has not let you down. I pray that we have not been as Chief Seattle wondered if we are. The language in which I've been addressing you, the machines that are amplifying my voice, the dyestuffs in our garments, the subjects you've studied, none of this was invented by anybody here. We got this language and the garments and the mathematics and the music and the ceramic engineering, all the rest of it, from our elders who got those goods from people who are now dead, in a chain going back farther than anybody can trace.

Woe be to us if we have in any way broken that chain that goes so far back. Curses on us if we've held treasures that have crossed thousands of years through successive generations, from the dead to the not yet born. Think of your ancestors: Among them, for everybody here, among your ancestors have been princes and slaves. Everybody here in this stadium, if we seek among your tens of thousands of ancestors, will find not only slaves and royal personages, but the products of love matches and rapes, people who died of starvation, people who thrived, and across all those adventures and misadventures, somehow the treasures have been passed on.

Therefore, though some of you who graduate today will found mighty businesses, and some of you will make spectacular works of art and some of you will be effective healers and scientists and thinkers and politicians, I ask you to remember that in a certain sense, the most important thing about you will not be the prizes you win or your accomplishments.

Though you win a Nobel Prize in physics and literature, in a sense it is more important that you keep physics and literature alive, to be passed on to the generations that follow you, as treasures that you got from the generations that preceded you. Your success in business or law may be laudable, and may enrich you and your families and communities, but that is less important in the largest way than the fact that by practicing your skills and exercising your knowledge, you are also preserving them and perfecting them, and you thank those predecessors who preserved and perfected those skills for you by maintaining them for those to follow you.

I charge you not to break the chain that goes back to the primates that evolved what we now separate into bands and music and poetry and speech as a means of extending memory in an individual lifetime and beyond it. I charge you in whatever way you choose to honor the past and to convey its treasures to the young.

They asked me to read something of my own, and I'll close by reading a poem of mine that maybe will be a good addendum to what I've said to you, because it presents a notion of the past as not necessarily, or history as not necessarily, the doings of big shots. The history in here is in many, many places, and you're sitting on it and wearing it and thinking it, and it's in your grooming and the shape of your nose and the garments on your back. The poem is called "Shirt."

Good luck and congratulations to you, Class of '99.

It's a great honor for me to be the third member of my family to receive an honorary doctorate from this great university. It's an honor to follow my great-uncle Jim, who was a gifted physician, and my Uncle Jack, who is a remarkable businessman. Both of them could have told you something important about their professions, about medicine or commerce.

I have no specialized field of interest or expertise, which puts me at a disadvantage, talking to you today. I'm a novelist. My work is human nature. Real life is all I know. Don't ever confuse the two, your life and your work. The second is only part of the first.

Don't ever forget what a friend once wrote Senator Paul Tsongas when the senator decided not to run for reelection because he'd been diagnosed with cancer: "No man ever said on his deathbed I wish I had spent more time in the office." Don't ever forget the words my father sent me on a postcard last year: "If you win the rat race, you're still a rat." Or what John Lennon wrote before he was gunned down in the driveway of the Dakota: "Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans."

You walk out of here this afternoon with only one thing that no one else has. There will be hundreds of people out there with your same degree; there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you will be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just your life at a desk, or your life on a bus, or in a car, or at the computer. Not just the life of your minds, but the life of your heart. Not just your bank account, but your soul.

People don't talk about the soul very much anymore. It's so much easier to write a resume than to craft a spirit. But a resume is a cold comfort on a winter night, or when you're sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you've gotten back the test results and they're not so good.

Here is my resume: I am a good mother to three children. I have tried never to let my profession stand in the way of being a good parent. I no longer consider myself the center of the universe. I show up. I listen, I try to laugh. I am a good friend to my husband. I have tried to make marriage vows mean what they say. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh. I am a good friend to my friends, and they to me. Without them, there would be nothing to say to you today, because I would be a cardboard cutout. But call them on the phone, and I meet them for lunch. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh.

I would be rotten, or at best mediocre at my job, if those other things were not true. You cannot be really first rate at your work if your work is all you are.

So here is what I wanted to tell you today:

Get a life. A real life, not a manic pursuit of the next promotion, the bigger paycheck, the larger house. Do you think you'd care so very much about those things if you blew an aneurysm one afternoon, or found a lump in your breast? Get a life in which you notice the smell of salt water pushing itself on a breeze over Seaside Heights, a life in which you stop and watch how a red-tailed hawk circles over the water gap or the way a baby scowls with concentration when she tries to pick up a cheerio with her thumb and first finger.

Get a life in which you are not alone. Find people you love, and who love you. And remember that love is not leisure, it is work. Each time you look at your diploma, remember that you are still a student, still learning how to best treasure your connection to others. Pick up the phone. Send an e-mail. Write a letter. Kiss your Mom. Hug your Dad. Get a life in which you are generous.

Look around at the azaleas in the suburban neighborhood where you grew up; look at a full moon hanging silver in a black, black sky on a cold night.

And realize that life is the best thing ever, and that you have no business taking it for granted. Care so deeply about its goodness that you want to spread it around. Once in a while take money you would have spent on beers and give it to charity. Work in a soup kitchen. Be a big brother or sister.

All of you want to do well. But if you do not do good, too, then doing well will never be enough. It is so easy to waste our lives: our days, our hours, our minutes. It is so easy to take for granted the color of the azaleas, the sheen of the limestone on Fifth Avenue, the color of our kid's eyes, the way the melody in a symphony rises and falls and disappears and rises again. It is so easy to exist instead of live. I learned to live many years ago.

Something really, really bad happened to me, something that changed my life in ways that, if I had my druthers, it would never have been changed at all. And what I learned from it is what, today, seems to be the hardest lesson of all. I learned to love the journey, not the destination. I learned that it is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you get. I learned to look at all the good in the world and to try to give some of it back because I believed in it completely and utterly. And I tried to do that, in part, by telling others what I had learned. By telling them this:

Consider the lilies of the field. Look at the fuzz on a baby's ear. Read in the backyard with the sun on your face. Learn to be happy. And think of life as a terminal illness because if you do you will live it with joy and passion, as it ought to be lived.

Well, you can learn all those things, out there, if you get a life, a full life, a professional life, yes, but another life, too, a life of love and laughs and a connection to other human beings. Just keep your eyes and ears open. Here you could learn in the classroom. There the classroom is everywhere. The exam comes at the very end. No man ever said on his deathbed I wish I had spent more time at the office. I found one of my best teachers on the boardwalk at Coney Island maybe 15 years ago. It was December, and I was doing a story about how the homeless survive in the winter months.

He and I sat on the edge of the wooden supports, dangling our feet over the side, and he told me about his schedule; panhandling the boulevard when the summer crowds were gone, sleeping in a church when the temperature went below freezing, hiding from the police amidst the Tilt a Whirl and the Cyclone and some of the other seasonal rides. But he told me that most of the time he stayed on the boardwalk, facing the water, just the way we were sitting now even when it got cold and he had to wear his newspapers after he read them.

And I asked him why. Why didn't he go to one of the shelters? Why didn't he check himself into the hospital for detox? And he just stared out at the ocean and said, "Look at the view, young lady. Look at the view."

And every day, in some little way, I try to do what he said. I try to look at the view. And that's the last thing I have to tell you today, words of wisdom from a man with not a dime in his pocket, no place to go, nowhere to be. Look at the view. You'll never be disappointed.

President Bulger, Chancellor Scott, Board of Trustees, Distinguished Members of the Platform Party, my fellow honorees.

Let's rip! Let's go! Rip! Okay. I was going to say most of all congratulations to all of you, you finally did it, but I think you know that already. 50 percent of you, 50 percent of you, are the first in your family to receive a university degree. 50 percent.

Thank you, thank you. To those of you who are going on to graduate school, good luck. And to those of you who are not, bad luck. For now, reality sets in. The last three weeks I've asked people to remember who spoke at their graduation, and what do they remember? 99 percent cannot remember the name of the speaker or what they said. Not one thing that they said. So you'd better not let me down today. My name is Billie Jean King!

And I want you to remember one thing before you get out of here. I want to keep it really simple: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Woooo! Let's see if you remember a couple of things. As the Olympic coach for the woman's tennis team, I have a journal: the four basic parts to us. The physical. The mental. The emotional. The spiritual. Can you do that? Can you remember that? Physical! Mental! Emotional! Spiritual! Yes! Maybe you'll remember that. Yes!

And when you dream your dreams, make sure you integrate all these parts so you have total fulfillment. Do you remember it? Come on! Physical, mental, emotional, spiritual! And as you leave today, to go on, I don't want you to forget your friendships. And here's something that is so important, particularly in business. Your friendships, your relationships, your networking, and your mentoring. If it hadn't been for a friend, I would have never played tennis. It was the last sport I ever played. I played every other sport before I played tennis. All team sports. Always a team sport. And a friend of mine, Susan Williams, in the fifth grade, said, "Do you want to play tennis?" And I said, "What's tennis?" So my friend Susan Williams brought me to tennis, and at my first free lesson at the public park, I decided I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world. But if it hadn't been for Susan, I wouldn't have gotten there. Yeah! Yeah!

So don't lose your friendships and your acquaintanceships that you have here today. Don't ever lose them. They'll be part of your networking as you get older. It'll be important. Find a mentor. Find a mentor and be a mentor. Give back. And when people tell you not to believe in your dreams, and they say "Why?", say "Why not?" As you heard from your student speaker Litza [Melendez], she dreamed about being the student speaker here four years ago as a freshman. And her dream came true today, and I congratulate her.

My younger brother Randy Moffatt was a major-league baseball player for twelve years, most of those years with the San Francisco Giants as a relief pitcher. He was cut from his high school team and told he was not going to make it. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school team and told he would not make it. You want to be like Mike? Why not?

WORLD TEAMTENNIS is my dream, it's coed, and everyone for thirty years has told me "Give it up," and I'm never going to give it up. So remember to dream, and then to go out and act. Today one of our fellow honorees Ahmed Kathrada received his honorary doctorate. Just think about living 26 years in prison. As a child, Ahmed wanted to end apartheid in South Africa. And even when he was in prison with Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, they never gave up their dream. And now there's a new South Africa because of people like Ahmed Kathrada. Don't ever forget it!

June 23, 1972. Title IX. It was the first time a woman ever got an athletic scholarship to college. In 1972. Men had been getting them for over 100 years. You can be proud to be at the University of Massachusetts here at Amherst because you are among a handful of institutions that are fully compliant with Title IX. And the University achieves this in women's sports while not reducing any sports from the men's program. That is awesome, because only a handful of universities throughout this country are in compliance. So I thank you very much for that.

Without Title IX, our women would have never won the gold medals in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. We won softball. We won women's gymnastics. We won basketball. And we won soccer. And last year we won the World Cup in soccer for the women because of Title IX.

I'll fast forward. Now we're in 1973. We were just in 1972. Title IX, remember? Now we're in 1973. Let me set the stage. We're at the height of the women's movement. We were not burning bras, but wanting equal opportunity for women and men. Vietnam was finally calming down, we just passed Roe v. Wade, Watergate was heating up, we had no microwaves, we had no faxes, we had no cable TV, and personal computers? Forget it! Hadn't been thought of. Women were making 59 cents on the dollar in 1973, and the reason I played Bobby Riggs is because Margaret Port, the number-one player in the world that year, from Australia, had lost to him, on Mother's Day. It was called the Mother's Day Massacre. She lost so badly that I finally had to play the hustler Bobby Riggs, the former number-one tennis player in the world. And that match was not about tennis; it was about social change. It was about changing the hearts and minds of people to believe that women could chew gum and walk at the same time.

That we deserved an opportunity to compete, an opportunity to play. We deserved it. Now we're up to 75 cents on the dollar. Such a deal. We deserve a 25-cent discount every time we go shopping.

And the young men who experienced that match back in 1973, I call you the first generation of men of the women's movement. You are the first generation of men who insist that their daughters have equal opportunities with their sons. And the most important words that have helped me in life when things have gone right or when things have gone wrong are "accept responsibility.”
"Accept responsibility."
And I'll give you an idea. Like in tennis, every ball that comes to me is a decision. Every ball that comes to me is a decision. Do I slice it, do I hit cross-court, do I hit topspin, do I hit sidespin, do I lob? What do I do? But I have to accept responsibility for that. And that's where sports teaches us to put it on the line, so to speak, and live it. And here remember one thing. It's everyone's responsibility to lead, to honor, and to fight, for everyone's basic rights, for equality. Regardless of our gender, our age, our race, our religion, our appearance, sexual orientation or our abilities.
So dream, act, and lead. And congratulations to you! Yes! Massachusetts, yes, you're the best! Yes! Go for it! 

Good morning. Thank you very much. It is perhaps an understatement to say it's an honor to be back at MIT, addressing the graduating class of the year 2000. As I look out on this crowd, it is both humbling and inspiring.

I'd like to start my remarks this morning with special thanks to all of you who have sent me emails in the last couple of weeks. You see, when I sat down to write this speech, as commencement speakers naturally do, I tried to figure out what would be most meaningful to you in a time of tremendous change, in an era of prosperity, in this new world rushing towards all of us. And so, rather than impose my world view on you, I thought I'd ask you to give me a little advice, and so I decided to do a little research.

I sent out an email to all the graduates, asking you not only where I should focus, but what I should avoid. And I must say, you are both a prolific and a diverse bunch. I received hundreds of messages. And the mail I received actually gives you some great insights into the graduating class here at MIT.

As soon as one person would ask me to talk about something, the next person would say, please don't talk about that. Many of you asked me what it takes to succeed as a woman in business. Others said, for heaven sakes don't talk about being a woman. Some of you were curious about my work at Hewlett-Packard, but just as many said, we don't want to hear about Hewlett-Packard. Some of you wanted me to talk about the future of technology, but others said, I've studied enough about technology, please talk about something else.

Some said they wanted to hear about leadership. But one gentleman, in particular, who shall remain nameless, was very adamant in saying that he didn't want to hear anything about leadership. And, by the way, he also did not want to hear anything about Microsoft or Elian Gonzales. You know who you are.

The longer I looked at the messages, however, certain patterns began to emerge and slowly it became clear to me what I think you really wanted to hear. You wanted this address to be based on my life experience, not esoteric theory. You wanted to know the best way to make the decisions you'll need to live life, to build a career, and, with that one exception, of that nameless aforementioned gentleman, you actually did want to know how a leader can lead in this new landscape that's emerging from the mist. And, oh, I must also add, that on one point there was complete unanimity: please don't run over your time. On that last point I do promise to be brief.

And so, this morning, I'd like to talk about journeys, how you get from one place to another, and how sometimes the journey brings you back home. In some ways, today, for me, is about coming home. I was sitting in one of those chairs on the shady side only eleven years ago. [CHEERING] Thank you. In 1989, as a graduating Sloan Fellow, I can honestly say I didn't expect to be CEO of a company like Hewlett-Packard; truthfully, I don't think I expected to be a CEO at all. I can honestly say that I never would have predicted the huge impact that technology would today be playing in all our lives. And certainly, if you had looked at me in my cap and gown, seated in those chairs, eleven years ago, logic would not have indicated that I would be your commencement speaker today.

Journeys in life are far more random, far less orderly, than they seem at first glance. The reason I say first glance is that paths appear random, are random, especially when you are looking at them one step at a time. It's only when you stand back and see the whole journey in perspective, the paths chosen, the paths rejected, a pattern emerges, a pattern that over time defines the journey of life. And today for you is a wonderful day to put your journey in perspective.

The significance of commencement exercises dates back over centuries, because graduations have always been markers, life markers, along the way. Your time here at MIT and the journey that lies before you will be defined not only by the power of your logic and your intellect, but equally by the power of your aspiration and determination.

When I sat where you are eleven years ago, or when I sat in a different chair three thousand miles away at Stanford twenty-four years ago, the proud holder of an undergraduate degree in Medieval History, yes, that's true, or when I worked as a secretary in the shipping department of a company called Hewlett-Packard, typing bills of lading, logic and intellect would never have predicted that I would one day return to run that same Palo Alto company.

And this is, of course, exactly my point. At any one moment in time you often can't see where your path is heading and logic and intellect alone won't lead you to make the right choices, won't in fact take you down the right path. You have to master not only the art of listening to your head, you must also master listening to you heart and listening to your gut. One has to look beyond the immediate choices at hand and dare to dream big, dare to strive for the art of the possible, dare to truly aspire. It is far too easy to get paralyzed by the seeming weight of it all. It is too easy to freeze up at moments exactly like today. I can sympathize.

In some ways, the world you are going into, while far more prosperous, is actually far more complex, far more complicated, than the one I faced at Stanford in 1976, or even the one I faced here in 1989. But have no fear, although fear is part of the journey as well, because in fact you have all the tools you need up here in your head, here in your heart, and in your gut. All you really have to do is engage your heart, your gut, and your mind in every decision you make, engage your whole self and the journey will reveal itself with the passage of time. And so let me put that into personal context for you.

I can see now that I started my professional journey on the day at age 4 when I declared to my parents and to the world, Mom, Dad, I want to be a fireman. Now this was not some precious instinct towards civic duty. No, it really wasn't terribly profound. In fact, it was simply that I loved the color red and I thought the black and white dogs with spots were really cool. But when I look back now I see a kid who was not afraid to commit to a different path through life, and I see parents who encouraged their child's ambition whatever it was.

I see now also that I began my path to become a CEO on the day I decided to quit law school. After I realized that being a fireman was actually about more than the color red and the dogs, and I knew I couldn't paint like my artist mother, I automatically assumed that I would follow in my father's footsteps. You see, my father was a law professor and a judge, and his guidance and example have always meant the world to me. And so, after studying medieval things at Stanford, I went on to law school. I followed the logical path that I, and others, had always presumed for me. I wanted my father to be proud of me. I wanted to follow in his footsteps.

But it quickly became apparent to me in law school that I didn't like studying the law. For me, the emphasis on precedent felt confining. My father loved the law; he still loves the law, but while I was intellectually challenged, the rest of me was left cold. And so this presented for me a gut-wrenching dilemma. Do I risk letting my father down? Do I stick it out in law school? Or do I go do something else? Do I let go of this notion of the logical path for Carly?

And while that decision tortured me at the time, I literally didn't sleep for three months, I made the decision and I didn't blink and I left law school. What seemed at the moment, especially to my father, a random, ill-advised move, was actually an important life lesson and a marker in my own journey.

And I genuinely believe that life teaches lessons in strange ways. The lesson I learned at that life marker was love what you do, or don't do it. Don't make a choice of any kind, whether in career or in life, just because it pleases others or because it ranks high on someone else's scale of achievement or even because it seems to be, perhaps even for you at the time, simply the logical thing to do at that moment on your path. Make the choice to do something because it engages your heart as well as your mind. Make the choice because it engages all of you. Remember as graduate of a world class university, as a graduate of this place, with your double-E or your degree in Physics or Computer Science or Architecture, the freedom to choose is now yours.

And to make the most of that freedom, use your mind and your heart and your gut. Freedom to choose can sometimes feel like a terrible burden, but the burden is greatly lightened when we learn how to use our whole selves, when we realize that we have everything we need for this journey of life.

Now, here at MIT this morning, we are celebrating the graduation of your minds. Your minds have done exceptionally well in this training phase. You have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can absorb knowledge, and invent, and create. And the stuff that you have stored in your mind will be immensely valuable without question.

But your mind alone won't do it. When you leave here you start on the second important journey, figuring out how to listen to your heart. Now, of course, for some of you, engaging all of yourself is natural; it's easy for you. You've known how to do it perhaps since birth. But for the rest of us, getting there is a process. It can take years, decades. Some of us never get to know our whole selves, but we need to keep trying.

My own process of finding the soul to guide me brings me back once again to my parents. My mother was a stay-at-home wife and an artist, but my mother, more than anyone else, taught me about the power of aspiration and courage. She also taught me the world of dreams expressed in art, the world of things freed from the laws of everyday. And she did it with a strength and a passion that I wish could be bottled. Even when it wasn't easy or convenient, both my mother and father were ultimately true to themselves. And I absorbed that lesson from them. Their definition of greatness was about greatness of character.

And, of course, now it's time to turn to the parents in the audience, all of you who have instilled greatness of character into the graduates seated before us. And so I'd like to take a moment for the graduates to look out into this audience and find the people who have helped get you to this place, your parents, your grandparents, your partners, your guardians, your friends, whoever has been a catalyst, whoever has had defining influence and lasting impact on your life, whether they truly know it, whether you really see it, whether you really fully feel its weight yet. Take a moment now and honor all of them. [APPLAUSE]

And parents, guardians, partners and friends, those who have sacrificed so much for today's graduates, I have perhaps unfortunately some advice for you today as well. If you have done your job right, your soon to be newly minted MIT grad is going to follow their own path. If you have done your job well, they may in fact surprise you, confound you, even defy you. They may not become the doctor, or the teacher, or the electrical engineer, or the next billion dollar dot.com founder or Nobel Laureate. Then, again, they might. And that's OK. It is probably difficult to fathom, especially because you have worked so hard, sacrificed so much, to get your graduates to this incredible place. But your ultimate job is to let them go. Today is an important day for you, an acknowledgement of one chapter closed and the handing over of the pen, so they can write their own next chapter.

In this chapter, the one that is now coming to a close, when you first embarked upon it I think many of you were drawn to this place because of one of the words in its name: technology. Now some of you asked me to address the changing role of technology in business and in life. As you draw this first chapter in your life to a close, we are also drawing the first chapter in the Information Age to a close. And I believe we are now entering the Renaissance phase of the Information Age, where creativity and ideas are the new currency, and invention is a primary virtue, where technology truly has the power to transform lives, not just businesses, where technology can help us solve fundamental problems.

In this new world we must always remember that technology is only as valuable as the use to which it is put. In the end, technology is ultimately about people. And in this technology Renaissance, we will witness and experience the fundamental transference of power to the people, to the masses. To the individuals who bring their own spark, their own energy to the process, technology becomes not about bits and bytes, but about the celebration of people's minds and people's hearts.

And so, what will it mean to be a leader in this world that you are entering? How must leadership be re-invented to be commensurate with the opportunity, the world we have just described?

Leadership in this new landscape is not about controlling decision-making. We don't have time anymore to control decision-making. It's about creating the right environment. It's about enablement, empowerment. It is about setting guidelines and boundaries and parameters and then setting people free.

Leadership is not about hierarchy or title or status; it is about having influence and mastering change. Leadership is not about bragging rights or battles or even the accumulation of wealth; it's about connecting and engaging at multiple levels. It's about challenging minds and capturing hearts. Leadership in this new era is about empowering others to decide for themselves. Leadership is about empowering others to reach their full potential. Leaders can no longer view strategy and execution as abstract concepts, but must realize that both elements are ultimately about people.

Now, of course, traditional aspects of being a Chief Executive will continue to be important, like understanding the business or the institution, understanding the numbers or the assets, pushing the right levers to bring about the right results. But the most magical and tangible and ultimately most important ingredient in the transformed landscape is people. The greatest strategy in the world, the greatest financial plan in the world, the greatest turnaround in the world, is only going to be temporary if it isn't grounded in people.

There are small and large acts of leadership. And small acts of leadership can change the world as surely as large acts. Ultimately they can have as much effect on people's lives as big ones. A mother who teaches a child inventive ways of thinking, or a mother that encourages her daughter's desire to become a fireman, that's a small act of leadership. A dad who lets his daughter quit the law, that's a small act of leadership.

Expressed another way, your generation of leaders will know that every one on this earth is born with the potential to lead. And that is a deep and fundamental shift, a shift worth celebrating. Every man and every woman on this earth is born to lead. A leader's greatest obligation is to make possible an environment where people's minds and hearts can be inventive, brave, human and strong, where people can aspire to do useful and significant things, where people can aspire to change the world.

At Hewlett-Packard we call this way of thinking, this set of behaviors, the rules of the garage. You see the garage is a special place to us; it is where we began. But these rules are about the way we compete and the way we work.

And our rules are, believe you can change the world, work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever, know when to work alone and when to work together; share tools, ideas, trust your colleagues. No politics, no bureaucracy: these are ridiculous in a garage. The customer defines a job well done. Radical ideas are not bad ideas. Invent different ways of working. Make a contribution every day. If it doesn't contribute, it doesn't leave the garage. Believe that together we can do anything. Invent.

These rules, while they really are core to the culture and behaviors that drive HP, I believe that if you carry these rules with you on your journey, if you create an environment where people's hearts and minds are fully engaged, where strategy is ennobling, where great aspirations are powered by the desires of people to do something worthwhile, then you will have touched others you encounter on your journey.

And now I am almost finished and you are just beginning a great journey. You are commencing your life's work. Many of you are commencing your lives as adults. I'm a bit further along than you. Perhaps that's why you ask me what, if anything, I would have done differently. Would I skip medieval history and philosophy? Would I have stayed in law school? Would I have become a fireman? Would I have preferred not to have been a secretary? And the answer to all of these questions is, no. I still believe that everything I did had a purpose, even if the purpose was to tell me I was going the wrong way. I believe every lesson life has taught has prepared me for what I do today.

Now, if I could send you an email, every year for the rest of your days -- don't worry, I won't -- I'd say this: see your life as a journey, pause at moments like this to see life's markers and the patterns that emerge, know yourself, be true to yourself, engage your whole self in everything you do. Remember that leadership is not in fact about you, but about the people who you are trying to inspire by unleashing their talents, their hopes, their aspirations. Remember that leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes. And last, if technology is your passion, then make sure people are at the heart of your endeavors.

And finally, remember that throughout this journey, the only limits that really matter are the ones you put on yourself, and that those crucial moments in your life, when you know what you need to do, but others advise against what they perceive to be a detour from your path, know yourself, trust your whole self, and don't blink. If you do these things, when you look back, or maybe when you look down from this podium, you will know that this journey was a wonderful gift and that you have made as much of this wonderful gift as you could have. Thank you very much.

Speaking to you today marks a milestone in my life. I am 40 years old. 22 years ago, when I was in your seat, I never, ever thought I would be 40 years old.

The implications of being your speaker frightens me. For one thing, when a 40 year old geezer spoke at my baccalaureate ceremony, he was about the last person I'd believe. I have no intention of giving you the boring speech that you are dreading. This speech will be short, sweet, and not boring.

I am going to talk about hindsights today. Hindsights that I've accumulated in the 20 years from where you are to where I am. Don't blindly believe me. Don't take what I say as "truth." Just listen. Perhaps my experience can help you out a tiny bit.

I will present them a la David Letterman. Yes, 40-year old people can still stay up past 11.

#10: Live off your parents as long as possible.

When I spoke at this ceremony two years ago, this was the most popular hindsight-except from the point of view of the parents. Thus, I knew I was on the right track.

I was a diligent Oriental in high school and college. I took college-level classes and earned college-level credits. I rushed through college in 3 1/2 years. I never traveled or took time off because I thought it wouldn't prepare me for work and it would delay my graduation.

Frankly, I blew it.

You are going to work the rest of your lives, so don't be in a rush to start. Stretch out your college education. Now is the time to suck life into your lungs-before you have a mortgage, kids, and car payments.

Take whole semesters off to travel overseas. Take jobs and internships that pay less money or no money. Investigate your passions on your parent's nickel. Or dime. Or quarter. Or dollar. Your goal should be to extend college to at least six years.

Delay, as long as possible, the inevitable entry into the workplace and a lifetime of servitude to bozos who know less than you do, but who make more money. Also, you shouldn't deprive your parents of the pleasure of supporting you.

#9 Pursue joy, not happiness.

This is probably the hardest lesson of all to learn. It probably seems to you that the goal in life is to be "happy." Oh, you may be have sacrifice and study and work hard, but, by and large, happiness should be predictable.

Nice house. Nice car. Nice material things. Take my word for it, happiness is temporary and fleeting. Joy, by contrast, is unpredictable. It comes from pursing interests and passions that do not obviously result in happiness.

Pursuing joy, not happiness will translate into one thing over the next few years for you: Study what you love. This may also not be popular with parents. When I went to college, I was "marketing driven." It's also an Oriental thing.

I looked at what fields had the greatest job opportunities and prepared myself for them. This was brain dead. There are so many ways to make a living in the world, it doesn't matter that you've taken all the "right" courses. I don't think one person on the original Macintosh team had a classic "computer science" degree.

You parents have a responsibility in this area. Don't force your kids to follow in your footsteps or to live your dreams. My father was a senator in Hawaii. His dream was to be a lawyer, but he only had a high school education. He wanted me to be a lawyer.

For him, I went to law school. For me, I quit after two weeks. I view this a terrific validation of my inherent intelligence.

#8: Challenge the known and embrace the unknown.

One of the biggest mistakes you can make in life is to accept the known and resist the unknown. You should, in fact, do exactly the opposite: challenge the known and embrace the unknown.

Let me tell you a short story about ice. In the late 1800s there was a thriving ice industry in the Northeast. Companies would cut blocks of ice from frozen lakes and ponds and sell them around the world. The largest single shipment was 200 tons that was shipped to India. 100 tons got there unmelted, but this was enough to make a profit.

These ice harvesters, however, were put out of business by companies that invented mechanical ice makers. It was no longer necessary to cut and ship ice because companies could make it in any city during any season.

These ice makers, however, were put out of business by refrigerator companies. If it was convenient to make ice at a manufacturing plant, imagine how much better it was to make ice and create cold storage in everyone's home.

You would think that the ice harvesters would see the advantages of ice making and adopt this technology. However, all they could think about was the known: better saws, better storage, better transportation.

Then you would think that the ice makers would see the advantages of refrigerators and adopt this technology. The truth is that the ice harvesters couldn't embrace the unknown and jump their curve to the next curve.

Challenge the known and embrace the unknown, or you'll be like the ice harvester and ice makers.

#7: Learn to speak a foreign language, play a musical instrument, and play non-contact sports.

Learn a foreign language. I studied Latin in high school because I thought it would help me increase my vocabulary. It did, but trust me when I tell you it's very difficult to have a conversation in Latin today other than at the Vatican. And despite all my efforts, the Pope has yet to call for my advice. Learn to play a musical instrument. My only connection to music today is that I was named after Guy Lombardo. Trust me: it's better than being named after Guy's brother, Carmen. Playing a musical instrument could be with me now and stay with me forever. Instead, I have to buy CDs at Tower.

I played football. I loved football. Football is macho. I was a middle linebacker-arguably, one of the most macho position in a macho game. But you should also learn to play a non-contact sport like basketball or tennis. That is, a sport you can play when you're over the hill.

It will be as difficult when you're 40 to get twenty two guys together in a stadium to play football as it is to have a conversation in Latin, but all the people who wore cute, white tennis outfits can still play tennis. And all the macho football players are sitting around watching television and drinking beer.

#6: Continue to learn.

Learning is a process not an event. I thought learning would be over when I got my degree. It's not true. You should never stop learning. Indeed, it gets easier to learn once you're out of school because it's easier to see the relevance of why you need to learn.

You're learning in a structured, dedicated environment right now. On your parent's nickel. But don't confuse school and learning. You can go to school and not learn a thing. You can also learn a tremendous amount without school.

#5: Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself.

I know a forty year old woman who was a drug addict. She is a mother of three. She traced the start of her drug addiction to smoking dope in high school.

I'm not going to lecture you about not taking drugs. Hey, I smoked dope in high school. Unlike Bill Clinton, I inhaled. Also unlike Bill Clinton, I exhaled.

This woman told me that she started taking drugs because she hated herself when she was sober. She did not like drugs so much as much as she hated herself. Drugs were not the cause though she thought they were the solution.

She turned her life around only after she realized that she was in a downward spiral. Fix your problem. Fix your life. Then you won't need to take drugs. Drugs are neither the solution nor the problem.

Frankly, smoking, drugs, alcohol-and using an IBM PC-are signs of stupidity. End of discussion.

#4: Don't get married too soon.

I got married when I was 32. That's about the right age. Until you're about that age, you may not know who you are. You also may not know who you're marrying.

I don't know one person who got married too late. I know many people who got married too young. If you do decide to get married, just keep in mind that you need to accept the person for what he or she is right now.

#3: Play to win and win to play.

Playing to win is one of the finest things you can do. It enables you to fulfill your potential. It enables you to improve the world and, conveniently, develop high expectations for everyone else too.

And what if you lose? Just make sure you lose while trying something grand. Avinash Dixit, an economics professor at Princeton, and Barry Nalebuff, an economics and management professor at the Yale School of Organization and Management, say it this way:

"If you are going to fail, you might as well fail at a difficult task. Failure causes others to downgrade their expectations of you in the future. The seriousness of this problem depends on what you attempt."

In its purest form, winning becomes a means, not an end, to improve yourself and your competition.

Winning is also a means to play again. The unexamined life may not be worth living, but the unlived life is not worth examining. The rewards of winning-money, power, satisfaction, and self-confidence-should not be squandered.

Thus, in addition to playing to win, you have a second, more important obligation: To compete again to the depth and breadth and height that your soul can reach. Ultimately, your greatest competition is yourself.

#2: Obey the absolutes.

Playing to win, however, does not mean playing dirty. As you grow older and older, you will find that things change from absolute to relative. When you were very young, it was absolutely wrong to lie, cheat, or steal.

As you get older, and particularly when you enter the workforce, you will be tempted by the "system" to think in relative terms. "I made more money." "I have a nicer car." "I went on a better vacation."

Worse, "I didn't cheat as much on my taxes as my partner." "I just have a few drinks. I don't take cocaine." "I don't pad my expense reports as much as others."

This is completely wrong. Preserve and obey the absolutes as much as you can. If you never lie, cheat, or steal, you will never have to remember who you lied to, how you cheated, and what you stole.

There absolutely are absolute rights and wrongs.

#1: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone.

This is the most important hindsight. It doesn't need much explanation. I'll just repeat it: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone.

Nothing-not money, power, or fame-can replace your family and friends or bring them back once they are gone. Our greatest joy has been our baby, and I predict that children will bring you the greatest joy in your lives-especially if they graduate from college in four years.

And now, I'm going to give you one extra hindsight because I've probably cost your parents thousands of dollars today. It's something that I hate to admit too.

By and large, the older you get, the more you're going to realize that your parents were right. More and more-until finally, you become your parents. I know you're all saying, "Yeah, right." Mark my words.

Remember these ten things: if just one of them helps you helps just one of you, this speech will have been a success:

#10: Live off your parents as long as possible.

#9 Pursue joy, not happiness.

#8: Challenge the known and embrace the unknown.

#7: Learn to speak a foreign language, play a musical instrument, and play non-contact sports.

#6: Continue to learn.

#5: Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself.

#4: Don't get married too soon.

#3: Play to win and win to play.

#2: Obey the absolutes.

#1: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone.

Congratulations on your graduation. Thank you very much.

Chairman Beard, President Marshall, President Shaw, Trustees, faculty members, parents and friends, alumnae/i reunion classes (especially the unsurpassed Class of 1960): thank you for giving me a great honor as well as the chance to be part of this wonderful day at Wheaton.

My impressions of Wheaton were formed while I was busy forming impressions of the president of the Class of 1960, Jill Galston, whom I was dating in her freshman year. To some extent, both sets of impressions fused together in my mind. Jill was the only girl in my experience who, saying goodnight after our first couple of dates, each time gave me a firm handshake. I attributed something of her sturdy confidence to Wheaton. It was clear that this was a person, and perhaps a college, that expected you to earn what you got, and where it wouldn't come easily! Later she introduced me to two teachers who changed her life: Mary Heuser, who gave her a lifelong interest in art, and Clinton McCoy, who introduced her to the invertebrates of a noxious little pond outside town and made her a biologist. Both teachers were plain-spoken, warm, and best of all, demanding. I have always taken their qualities to be Wheaton College's qualities. Candidates for degrees of the Class of 2000: it's my task as commencement speaker to delay your achieving what you came here for. The idea is that the delay is supposed to be worth it, that in your last hour of college life I can make you better equipped to lead the rest of your lives. Never mind that most of you have parents ready to supply you with advice for as long as there is breath in their bodies, or yours. I, a perfect stranger, am supposed to reveal to you some deep general truths about the world that have so far remained hidden from you. Here is my problem: I have no taste for generalizations, and in the course of my work I may actually have lost all capacity for abstract thought. I've spent my career on specifics, on works of art - grappling with them, buying them, putting buildings around them, exhibiting them to the public, all the while trying to wring sense out of them in all their vivid individuality. I comfort myself with the words of the artist and poet William Blake: "To generalize is to be an Idiot. To particularize is alone Distinction of Merit. General knowledge are those knowledge that idiots possess." If I'm going to do you any good at all this morning, I'd best be specific. Forty years ago in New Haven at my commencement we may have had a speaker, but honestly, I forget. If we did, he or she must have generalized a lot. I have been musing on what I wish I had been told that day, on the advice I needed then and for most of my life afterward. Practical, specific stuff, things Blake might have told us. I idly made a list, and soon I had written the speech I never heard. I might have ignored the advice, of course and so may you. Nevertheless, here are eight things I wish I'd been told at my commencement.

1. Put the alarm clock in the bathroom.
(And keep the door open,) This can be ignored by those of you whose irrepressible need to get going in the morning make it unnecessary. Others - I promise! - will find it the most important thing I have to say this afternoon.

2. Do one thing at a time.
Give each experience all your attention.Try to resist being distracted by other sights and sounds, other thoughts and tasks, and when it is, guide your mind back to what you're doing.
Longo before we taught "multi-tasking" to machines, I was brought up with some crude prototype Windows software in my head. I usually ran several programs at once, clicking back and forth, and always looking for a pull-down menu of new distractions. What's more, I thought that virtuosity would be a social advantage to me - the ability to impress people by doing a lot of things at once, none of them very well. And there were a lot of things: in high school I thought I'd be admired for switching effortlessly from Calypso lyrics to baseball statistics, to Latin, to brands of single malt whiskey. In graduate school I met my ideal in life when I studied the career of the Flemish painter Peter Paul Roberts, who was described by a Danish man who visited Rubens at work in his studio in the 1630s in Antwerp:

"While he was still painting, [Rubens] was having Tacitus read aloud to him, and was dictating a letter. When [we were] silent so we wouldn't disturb him, he began to talk to us, while continuing to paint, listening to the reading, and dictating his letter, answering our questions and thus displaying his astonishing powers."

A few geniuses can succeed this way; most of us can't and shouldn't try. I'm not warning against learning many things on many subjects, and virtuosity can indeed be useful. My warning is against distraction, whether you invite it or just let it happen, as I've done all my life. In baseball, high-percentage hitters know better: it's "focus" they talk about, and they prize it as much as strength. Psychologists describe skilled rockclimbers and tennis players and pianists as going beyond focus, to what they have called a "flow" experience, a sense of absorption with the rock or the ball or the music in which the "me versus it" disappears and there's a kind of oneness with the task that brings a joyful higher awareness, as well as successful performance. I've had these experiences, too little but not too late, and probably you have, too. They are a supreme kind of pleasure. You will have more of them if you do one thing at a time.


3. Spend more time listening.
Lawyers have a saying about conferences between legal opponents: "The side doing the talking is losing," For the longest time I thought that the test of my value was what I had to say. When I wasn't talking, I did listen to others, but with half my mind figuring out what I'd say next. It's as though I had been listening to music and just registering the melody but not hearing the harmony, the instruments, the subtleties of phrasing. To really listen takes active attention. To have listened and absorbed the whole message, with all its connotations, its unspoken and maybe unintended shadings, makes it likelier that when you do speak, you will contribute more, and do so with fewer words.
Lest this sound like a lesson in tactics, let me say that it's not just other people to whom you might listen more attentively, Try it on yourself. Pay attention not just to your voice, but also to your unvoiced sensations, your pleasure, your anger, your unease, your unspoken but genuine sense of things. (Here I should admit that if I'd gotten this advice at my New England commencement I'd have written it off as pure California.) It took me years to learn to pay attention to my complex reactions to situations, which were often so different from the friendly, constructive attitudes I thought I should have, and pretended to have. I've learned that if I didn't attend honestly to my own state of mind, I couldn't pay honest attention to others. I couldn't give empathetic help to others, or get it, either. So spend more time listening to yourself as well as others.


4. Make yourself clear.
This is risky. To say clearly what you think is to risk being more clearly wrong. To fudge what you think - to qualify it, complicate it, overload it - is usually a defensive move. It's a strategy for getting partial credit: you figure you may be wrong but at least you're clever, you're eloquent... and maybe not that far wrong.
I work in a field - art history - that is rich in adjectives, poor in provable statements, just right for somebody who hides from clarity behind vivid, entertaining language. The best antidote I ever heard prescribed to writers came from the art historian Howard Hibbard, who told us students what to do when we'd written a sentence: "Take your favorite word and strike it out." Hibbard meant that often we put the word there not for clarity but for vanity. Now that I've been spending most of my time as a manager, by the way, clarity has become a necessity, and my best friend. It saves my time and other people's. As to the risk of clarity I mentioned just now, that's mostly imaginary; after all, I do still have my job.


5. You educate yourself.
From now on, you had better put yourself in charge of your own education, if you haven't already, You may have to buck the system. American graduate education is a lot more clearly structured and scheduled than its British and European models. The menu and the timetable are there in the catalogue: take your choice of degree programs, sign up, take the courses, pass the exams, write the thesis, and out you come - certified - a doctor, lawyer, art historian, computer scientist, philosopher. Along the way, most graduate programs confine you to the professional cultures you are preparing to enter. In medicine and law, don't expect to be taught much about the minds and spirits of the people you are preparing to serve. In the humanities and social sciences, everything will conspire to keep you close to the library and the computer, and away from the real subject of your study, whether it's Renaissance paintings, or the Balkans, or family farmers.
Here is an example. During, the past generation art history has been preoccupied with questions of art theory and the social and economic and political contexts of art, which can be answered from illustrations in books. This has made the field richer intellectually, but it's excused faculty members and graduate students from going to real works of art in the original and dealing with them, looking hard and long, trying to grasp their peculiar way of communicating, enjoying their pleasures, appreciating how they elude simple classification and undermine theories. Learning art history without looking at art in the original is like learning about Shakespeare and Ibsen by reading plays and never going to the theater. Our graduate schools produce a lot of half-baked bread in the interest of getting it on the shelf quicker. Don't let the weaknesses of the system become weaknesses of your own. Look critically at what you're asked to learn and how. If it's too little, and too confined to the campus, then swallow the need to stretch out the time you spend, take courses not on the prescribed menu, and travel. In the humanities, nothing substitutes for travel abroad, though it takes time, money and the courage to risk being thought un-serious by the faculty, by your family and maybe by yourself. Parents, listen. You may have to subsidize even more education than you imagined, and it won't all took like work. But it's in a good cause.


6. Learn to draw. Or to play the cello. Or to tap dance,
Something impractical, even useless. Whatever it is, it ought to be hard for you, something you haven't really got time for, and that by professional standards you probably won't ever do well. I recommend drawing because when you get it right, maybe only once in a while, you will have such amazing waves of surprise and joy. And I promise that you'll have always be able to draw on a personal insight, a visceral empathy, with centuries of artists and their struggles to get it right.

7. Keep a journal.
For a lot of people this is harder than tap dancing. Knowing you're going to write something every day sharpens your attention to everything that happens, With a journal, you have this companion you're going to point things out to, so you stockpile impressions and passing thoughts, or, if you have a fitful memory like mine, you jot down notes to yourself It's good to begin with modest expectations - a spiral notebook from the drugstore, not a leatherbound diary with little red ribbon. Limit the time you spend at it, but do it every day. When you fail, start again. And again. For the longest time, I didn't keep a journal, and as a result much of my pretty long and interesting life is lost to me. That's a waste, one that you needn't let happen to you.

8. You will be more like your parents than you imagine, or want to be.
One morning at the age of 45, I looked in the mirror to shave and there was my father looking back at me. Around the same time my kids started noticing that I was sounding like my mother, and even now Jill helpfully points out that when conversation gets tedious or embarrassing, I tend to leave the room -just like my mother. Now I notice I've got Dad's speech mannerisms and his walk, and my closet has his smells. My parents are both dead now, and there are days when I feel that I'm not just like my parents, I am my parents. Something like this will happen to you, but it needn't creep up on you and surprise you. Many of your parents have made sacrifices to give you the chance to be different from them, including send you to Wheaton, and of course you may be even more different as time passes. At some point, though, you will discover your similarities, count on it. To sharpen the irony, the qualities in your parents that annoy you today are likely to be exactly the ones that, later on, your kids will point out in you. So, until then, try giving your parents a break and have a sense of humor about all their qualities.

Dear almost-graduates: this is more than enough advice. You need to reflect on your own feelings, your own desires. The world badly wants your brains and energy: give them freely, but try to stay conscious of what it is you're giving of yourself and why. Meanwhile, celebrate your success at Wheaton and bask in the pride we all feel for you this morning.

I want to tell you three true stories this evening. Together they make a point that I consider one of the great secrets of life and I hope you’ll remember these stories, because I promise you that you’ll need them at some time or another. The first story is called "the First Tightrope Walker."

Story I: The First Tightrope Walker

In 1859 the Great Blondin -- the man who invented the high wire act, announced to the world that he intended to cross Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Five thousand people including the Prince of Wales gathered to watch. Halfway across, Blondin suddenly stopped, steadied himself, backflipped into the air, landed squarely on the rope then continued safely to the other side. During that year, Blondin crossed the Falls again and again -- once blindfolded, once carrying a stove, once in chains, and once on a bicycle. Just as he was about to begin yet another crossing, this time pushing a wheelbarrow, he turned to the crowd and shouted "who believes that I can cross pushing this wheelbarrow." Every hand in the crowd went up. Blondin pointed at one man.
"Do you believe that I can do it?" he asked.
"Yes, I believe you can," said the man.
"Are you certain?" said Blondin
"Yes," said the man.
"Absolutely certain?"
"Yes, Absolutely certain."
"Thank you" said Blondin, "then sir, get into the wheelbarrow."

Now, you’ve just had a first class education, from a first class university in a first class college, in one of the best psychology departments in the world. Like that man in the crowd, you know a lot of things. But also like that man, there will be times in your life when knowing things won’t matter as much as how scary the situation is -- and when that happens you’ll have to decide whether or not to get into the wheelbarrow. My second story is about how to make that decision. It’s also about an odd event that over the last thirty-eight years of my life came to be known as "the bet."

Story 2: The Bet

There were three of us. Carl, Ben and I grew up on the same street in Cincinnati and we played a lot of games together. One day in 1962 we were playing a game called careers. If you played that game as a child, you remember that you travel around a board like in monopoly, but instead of collecting money and property, you collect stars, hearts and dollar signs which represent fame, happiness and money.

Well, one of us won the game -- I don't remember who-- but I do remember that whoever it was started gloating and an argument followed about who would actually be the most successful in achieving fame, happiness and wealth. The argument ended in "the bet." We agreed to meet 38 years later at noon of leap year day – February 29th in the year 2000. We would each tell our life story and the person who had been most successful, presumably the one who had gathered the most money, stars and hearts, would have the honor of humiliating the two losers by paying for their dinners at the fanciest restaurant in Cincinnati-- The Maisonette-- which also happened to be one of only eleven five-star restaurants in the United States.

Carl, was probably the favorite to win the bet. He was strikingly handsome and very cool. and after we graduated from high school and then college he made a strong start, at least in terms of dollar signs, stars and hearts. He went to New York and rose high in the organized crime world. He owned limousines, mansions and yachts. He was well known around town and often seen in the company or beautiful women. Then one day a freighter carrying a shipload of his smuggled goods ran aground off the coast of the United States. Carl escaped before the coast guard seized the ship but his fortune was wiped out in a single day. For the first time in his life his confidence broke and he returned to Cincinnati and got a job as a TV cameraman. He had always said that he would never live to see age 35 and one Halloween night in 1982 his prophecy was fulfilled. Carl was killed while driving drunk at the age of 34.

Ben, the second participant in the bet, could sell anything to anybody. He started his own advertising agency and in 1982, the same year that Carl died, Ben’s agency had 30 employees and 20 million dollars in billing. Then one day after years of building the business, Ben realized that he had no life outside of work. He sold his advertising agency, put the money in trust for his kids, and went to India. When he returned he became a teacher in an inner city school but he didn’t do so well in that job and he was fired after the first year. I remember him telling me how interesting it was to have failed. It was the first time that he had failed at anything, but he was far from crushed. Rather, he was fascinated with the idea. Ben went through another half-dozen jobs, all of them successful as he gradually learned how to combine his sales ability with his desire to help others. He is now a team building consultant and troubleshooter for large corporations. He's called in when there's a communications problem and he shows people how to work together. And incidentally he makes several thousand dollars a day for doing so.

Me--I went into teaching. I have to tell you that not once in 38 years did I think that I would lose the bet. Not because I thought my success greater than Ben's or Carl's, but because I couldn't imagine anybody feeling more fulfilled than I felt. There is an inexpressible joy that comes, standing in front of a large class and knowing that the next thing you are going to say will change their way of looking at the world forever. I had that joy and I didn't see how Ben or Carl could match it.

For thirty-eight years, whenever anyone got a raise, or a new job or got married or divorced or broke a limb we recalculated their standing in the bet. Everybody had a chance to win. We all had interesting lives, we all experienced the best and worst that life offers. We all travelled to far places, lived under extraordinary conditions, and weathered grave dangers. We all got married, we all got divorced, we all remarried. We all had babies. We all became incredibly rich, we all went dead broke. We all did all of those things but not in the same order, and that kept things interesting. So much so that when Ben jumped out of an airplane on his fortieth birthday, I jumped with him just in case we later decided that that kind of thing mattered. Don't misunderstand me. None of us particularly cared about wining the bet, but we cared mightily about not losing.

As leap year day 2000 approached, Ben and I realized that neither of us knew how to judge who had been most successful. We knew what we had meant by success when we had played that careers game so many years before but we no longer thought that the board game reflected reality. I can't tell you how much of a shock that realization created. When we first started on the road to success it seemed that the only problem was how to get from here to there. Only after we had gone 38 years down that road did we realize that the goal had changed.

That was the nicest part of the bet. I am sure that even without the bet at some point in our lives we would have sat down and assessed whether or not we had been successful. But I am also sure that if we had not made the bet, and if we had not had had to come up with the criteria for deciding it, we never would have discovered how the meaning of "success" had changed for us over the years.

Last February 29th, Ben and I met at our old high school to decide the bet. A few months earlier, we had asked the English honors class there to help us and they had posed to us a series of essay questions about success. We had sent our answers the month before. Now they questioned us about our answers in person – in what I called the "swimsuit contest." Along the way, we had also acquired newspaper, television and magazine reporters – why I’m not sure, but I presume that it’s because of the billions of childhood bets that get made, we were the only two who were competitive enough to keep ours going for a lifetime. Winning or losing had always included lifetime gloating rights, but with the press on hand there was the potential for national humiliation.

The biggest surprise of the meeting with the students was the discovery that in our lives Ben and I had both learned the same central thing about success, and what we had learned had nothing to do with fame or money or happiness. It had to do with fear. Both of us had learned that on occasion, life will look you in the eye and say "get into the wheelbarrow." At that moment, all of your knowledge won't matter. All that will matter is how badly you need to get to the other side of the tightrope and how much you are afraid of falling.

Ben faced a wheelbarrow when he quit his business. He climbed in and with no money, started a new life. I got into my wheelbarrow about ten years ago on a lonely road in India when I broke my leg hundreds of miles from help. In the two weeks that it took to get to medical care, I learned things about survival that professors don’t often get to learn. Carl faced his wheelbarrow when he lost everything. Maybe he would have climbed in after a time, but we’ll never know – As they say in the jungle "sometimes a bird falls out of the nest." That’s what happened to Carl.

Why did Carl hit bottom and quit while Ben hit bottom, failed in his first job after that, and yet still had enough spirit to be fascinated with the situation rather than crushed? The answer has to do with the nature of success and the secret of life that I mentioned in my introduction. That secret is the subject of this third and last story. So, put away the bet for a moment. I'll and tell you who won after this last story called "The Worst Olympic Ski Jumper Ever.

Story 3: The Worst Olympic Ski Jumper Ever

Eddie "the Eagle" Edwards was Britain's only hope for a medal in ski jumping in the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. On the day of the event, the winner jumped 403 feet. Eddie the Eagle, in a borrowed ski suit and goggles held together with tape, jumped 238 feet. He finished 56th in a field of 56. For a while he was a laughingstock. Television commentators poked fun -- reporters tried to make him look foolish. But Eddie refused to be embarrassed. "This is the best day in my life. I'm representing Britain in the Olympics," he said -- " I just jumped 72 meters through the air -- that's a hard thing to do." Eddie was having a great time. Then somebody noticed that Eddie, was the first Olympic ski jumper that Britain had ever had. He had, by default, stumbled off with the British jumping record. Eddie became the darling of the public.

Eddie got rich over the next few years, giving endorsements. But then things went bad. He lost his money in bad investments, he was barred from the 1992 Olympics and he crashed in a post Olympic jump. "Broke me collarbone, fractured me skull, tore ligaments in me knee, damaged me kidney... And cracked me ribs."

The last I heard of Eddie, he was practicing on a jump simulator in his apartment, more than a thousand miles from the nearest real jump. And what does he say about his brush with glory now that the cameras have turned elsewhere?

"Calgary? Oh, it was brilliant. That was my dream since I was 8. Life since has been great. I've had a wonderful time, been all over the world. Been to lots of interesting places, done lots of interesting things, met lots of interesting people. I wouldn't give that up for the world."

What I learned from the bet, and what I want to tell you tonight, is what Eddie the Eagle seemed to know all along: There are times when you are going to do well, and times when you're going to fail. But neither the doing well, nor the failure is the measure of success. The measure of success is what you think about what you've done. Let me put that another way: The way to be happy is to like yourself and the way to like yourself is to do only things that make you proud

When Ben realized that he was failing, he risked everything to start again. He wasn’t an instant success, but he kept trying. He never declared himself a failure, because he was proud of himself through every effort. When Carl failed as a criminal, he had nothing to be proud of. He wasn’t proud of his life. He had to rely on the world’s opinion of him and the world’s opinion was that he was a failure.

The way to be happy is to like yourself. That’s the real reason not to lie or cheat or turn away in fear. There’s that old joke, not very funny, that goes "no matter where you go, there you are." That’s true. The person who you’re with most in life is yourself and if you don’t like yourself you’re always with somebody you don’t like.

When Ben and I finally went to the Maisonette to settle the bet with a 4 hour, 12 course, multi-vintage wine dinner, we split the $600 tab. If you take that to mean that the outcome was a tie then I haven't made my point. The fact is, that along with our final definition of success came the understanding that both of us had won. So by the rules of the bet we were each bound to pay for the other's dinner.

Ok, here’s the part of the talk that will be on the test: There are
many people around you today who have great hopes for your future. I myself, have three hopes for you:

First, there is going to come a time in your life when in order to
succeed you will have to trust -- when you will have to make a big leap of faith -- and when that time comes I hope you will swallow your fear and get into the wheelbarrow.

Second, whatever strong belief you now hold about what it means to be successful, I hope you will stay open to the possibility that you’ve got it all wrong and graciously accept your new awareness when it comes, with gratitude and humility.

And third, my dear friends, I hope you'll always be like Eddie the
Eagle and only do things that make you proud so that you can truly be your own hero.

Well that's pretty much all I have to tell you. Go get started on all
of the successes and failures and all of the other great things that you will do in your life. But when, in the course of some business or
social ski jump, you come in dead last, remember to smile for the
cameras -- And be sure along the way to become so proud of yourself that when the cameras turn to away you can go home alone and say to yourself. "Oh it was brilliant."

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is fantastic. I never made it to college-I didn't have enough money-and I decided I was going to be a writer anyway. And the reason I was going to go to college was all those girls. So it's a good thing I didn't go.

Before I start, how many of you here today read me in high school? How many? You're all my bastard children, aren't you? Thank you, thank you for that.

Apropos of nothing whatsoever, I'd like to tell you a very brief thing about my childhood. I arrived in Los Angeles when I was 13 years old. And I was enamored of Hollywood. I wanted to meet famous people. So, we were a very poor family. So we came out-my dad was looking for work in the Great Depression. And I put on my roller skates-I didn't have money to take the streetcar. So I put on my roller skates, and I roller skated out to Hollywood looking for famous people. And, by God, I found one! Out in front of Paramount Studios-standing as if he were waiting for me-was W. C. Fields, himself. I couldn't believe that, you know. And I roller skated up to him, and I said, "Mr. Fields, could I have your autograph?" And he signed and gave it back to me and says,"There you are, you little son of a bitch!" And here I am!

So, I've come a long way. I hope I have another 20 years to go. That gives you 20 years to get from here to Mars. That's the important thing. I've got to give you a few rules of hygiene here-very important for the next several days. You can do some of them tonight. First of all, from today on, none of you are ever going to have to watch local television news again, right? Don't look at it ever. Because it tells you how bad you are. It's full of rapes, murders, funerals, AIDS, all the good things, huh? So you're not to look at that.

Now, right after graduation today, make a list of the people who don't believe in you. And you have a few, don't you? I had plenty of people who told me not to do what I was going to do. You make a list this afternoon, of the people who don't believe in you, and you call them tonight, and tell them to go to hell!

And then you gather around you the people who do believe in you - your parents and a few friends, if you're lucky. We don't have many friends in this world; but the few that do believe in you - and then you move on into the future. I try to do that.

I had a thing happen to me when I was 9 years old, which is a great lesson. That was in 1929-the start of the Great Depression. And a single comic strip in the newspaper sent me into the future. The first comic strip of Buck Rogers. In October 1929 I looked at that one comic strip, with its view of the future, and I thought, "That's where I belong." I started to collect Buck Rogers comic strips. And everybody in the fifth grade made fun of me. I continued to collect them for about a month, and then I listened to the critics. And I tore up my comic strips. That's the worst thing I ever did. Two or three day later, I broke down. I was crying, and I said to myself, "Why am I crying? Whose funeral am I going to? Who died?" And the answer was, "Me." I'd torn up the future.

And then I sat down with myself, and I was crying, and I said, "What can I do to correct this?" And I said, "Well, hell, go back and collect Buck Rogers comic strips!"

For the next four or five years, move into the future. And don't listen to anymore damn fools after this. And that's what I did. I started collecting Buck Rogers again.

And I began to write when I was 12 years old, about going to the moon, about going to Mars, about moving out into the universe. Thank God, I made that decision. Against all the people who said don't do that, because science fiction in those days didn't exist. We had maybe two or three books a year. You had to wait for six months, or eight months, for a new book to come out. So I made my decision-I began to write. And made my life whole after that. So those are the basic things you have to do.

I envy your youngness today. I envy your youngness. If I had to go back, and do everything over, I'd do it again. With everything that's been wrong with my life; with everything that's been good; with all the mistakes, all the problems. When I got married, all my wife's friends said, "Don't marry him. He's going nowhere." But I said to her, "I'm going to the moon, and I'm going to Mars. Do you want to come along?" And she said, "Yes." She said yes. She took a vow of poverty, and married me. On the day of our wedding, we had $8 in the bank. And I put $5 in an envelope, and handed it to the minister. And he said, "What's this?" I said, "That's your pay for the ceremony today." He said, "You're a writer, aren't you?" And I said, "Yes." And he said, "You're going to need this." And he gave it to me. And I took it back. So a couple of years later when I had some money, I sent him a decent check. But we all start just about the same. Most of you are not as poor, at your beginning, as I was. But I was indeed poor.

But I got to writing all these short stories of mine, without knowing what I was doing. The important thing in life is to follow your passion-no matter what it is-for whatever mysterious reasons.

I wrote a whole series of stories about Mars, without knowing what the hell I was doing. And when I was 29 years old, my wife got pregnant. We had $40 in the bank. My friend, Norman Corwin, the great radio writer, told me, "You've got to go to New York City and let the people see you and know that you exist."

I went to New York with all my short stories. I went on the Greyhound bus-four days and four nights to New York City. No air conditioning, no toilets. We've had many improvements in the last few years. But traveling to New York on the Greyhound bus and then arriving at the YMCA, where I stayed for $5 a week. With a stack of manuscripts in my lap, hoping to conquer the editorial field. I met with all these editors. They rejected me. On my last night in New York-defeated by my encounters-I had dinner with the editor of Doubleday, who said to me, "What about all those Martian stories you've been writing? If you tied them together and made a tapestry of them, wouldn't they make a book called, The Martian Chronicles?" And I said, "Oh, my God!" He said, "Why?" I said, "I read a book on Winesburg, Ohio, when I was 24-years-old, and I thought to myself, "Oh, God, if I could just write a book with characters like this, but put it on the planet Mars, wouldn't that be fun!"

I made an outline-I forgot all about it. And the next four or five years, I wrote this book. Not knowing what I was doing. And here he was suggesting to me that maybe I had a novel. I had written a novel without knowing it. He says, "Bring me an outline tomorrow, and if it's any good, I'll give you a check for $700." So I stayed up all night, in the YMCA; wrote the outline; took it to him the next day, and he said, "This is it! This is The Martian Chronicles. Here's $700." He says, "Now do you have any other stories that we might get people to thinking would make a novel?" And I said, "Well, I've got a story about a man with tattoos all over his body, and when he perspires at night, the tattoos come to life and tell their stories." He said, "Here's another $700." And he bought The Illustrated Man that day. So I went home with $1500! I was rich - rich! To my place in Venice, California, where my pregnant wife was waiting for me. And our rent was $30 a month. You could have a baby for $100-El Cheapo, huh? And so the money I got from Doubleday paid for the baby, and for our rent for the next year and a half.

So, you see, we all start with somewhat similar beginnings. But I had this passion-this dedication to be something-to do something with my writing. I'm very proud to flip back to my blue and white annual, when I graduated from L.A. High School in summer, 1938, when I was 17 years old. They asked me how I was going to predict my future. And underneath my picture, I had them put, "Headed for Literary Distinction." How in the hell did I know that? How in the hell did I know that-because I was nowhere, I was nowhere at all. And the last night at school, I went up on top of the school-it was sunset, and I was playing a part in a play-and I cried. Because I knew it was going to be years before anything happened to me. But I had to make it happen. I had to make it happen. I had to believe in my passion. So, that's the way it finally turned out.

Now, I wrote a short story recently, about a young man I met when I was 30 years old. And he was 21. He was a genius. He wrote fantastic short stories. The sort of thing I didn't write when I was 21. I was in my late 20's before I began to write really well. And this boy was so talented. I took his short stories; I sent them out to the magazines. I sold them all immediately. And he had a bright future. He had it made already. He was already a genius. But he went in the Navy. He went away, and I didn't see him for 20 or 30 years. And about 15 years ago, an old man came up to me at a book signing. And he said to me, "Do you know who I am?" I said, "No." I didn't recognize him. He told me who he was. That was that young boy of 21-who was a genius. And I said, "You son of a bitch! What have you done with your life? What have you done with your life?"

He stopped. He didn't listen to the God-given genetics in his blood. He didn't follow his dream. And here he was now-an old man-with nothing! With nothing . . . I said, "You get the hell out of here this afternoon. And you go write another short story. And get your career started again."

He left that encounter with me-blasted by my fury. And he went home and wrote a short story, and sent it to me. And I sold it.

So, what I'm saying to you is this-20 years from now, I'll be 100. But I'm still going to be alive, and I'm going to meet a lot of you. And I hope I'm not going to say to you, "You son of a bitch, what have you done with your life?"

Whatever it is-whatever it is, do it! Sure there are going to be mistakes. Everything's not going to be perfect. I've written thousands of words that no one will ever see. I had to write them in order to get rid of them. But then I 've written a lot of other stuff too. So the good stuff stays, and the old stuff goes.

I've had various encounters-I want to mention one thing here-you may have seen it a couple of nights ago. They had a program-that the universe was going to end in two billion years. Did that make you-did you stay up all night worrying about that? I couldn't believe it. I said, my God, what you're worried about is tomorrow afternoon, and next week, and next year. And I'm here to tell you, it's going to be great for you. Leave the TV alone, don't get on the Internet too much because there's a lot of crap there-it's mainly male, macho crap. We men like to play with toys. You get yourself a good typewriter, go to the library-live there. Live in the library. See, I didn't go to school, but I went to the library. And I've stayed there for the last 50 years or so. When I was in my 40's, I had no money for an office. I was wandering around UCLA one day, 35 years ago, and I heard typing down below-in the basement of the library. And I went down to see what was going on. I found there was a typing room down there. And for 10 cents for a half an hour, I could rent a typewriter. I said, "My God. This is great! I don't have an office. I'll move in here with a bunch of students. And I'll write!" So, I got a bag full of dimes, and in the next nine days-I spent $9.80-and I wrote Fahrenheit 451.

So I wrote a dime novel, didn't I? And the book has been around-I didn't know it was going to be around-I didn't know any of these things would happen. And I wrote additions to it. I did another 25,000 words a few years later for a new edition of Fahrenheit 451. And a young editor came to me. He was looking for material; he didn't have much money. He was going to start a new magazine. This is in the autumn of 1953. He says, "Will you sell me something inexpensively?" And I said, "Yes, I have Fahrenheit 451 here. I'd like to sell it to a magazine." He said, "I have $400. Can I buy it from you?" I said, "Yes, you can." So he paid me $400, and Fahrenheit 451 appeared in the first, second, and third issues of Playboy. (I want a little applause, now, come on . . ..) You young men should appreciate the fact that I helped start that magazine.

Anyway, along the way, I worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. They were putting on a planetarium show, with astronomy, of course. But, they were boring the hell out of people. They took me in to see the show, and within 10 minutes, everybody was asleep. You could hear snoring all over the planetarium. And they took me back to the office, and the head of the Smithsonian said to me, "What are we doing wrong?" I said, " My God, do you know what you're doing in there? You're teaching with this planetarium, instead of preaching." A planetarium is a synagogue, a church, a basilica. It's a place to celebrate the universe, and the incredible fact of our being alive in this world. I said, "Get out of the way with your scientific technology, and let me do a thing called the Great Shout of the Universe. The universe coming alive for all these mysterious reasons."

So they hired me to write a new program for the planetarium. I did 32 pages on the incredible miracle of life on Earth, and the whole history of astronomy going back 2,000 years, and then 500 years into the future. I turned in the 32 pages, and they sent me 28 pages of criticism. I called them on the phone. I said, "What's the problem?" They said, "Well, this scientific thing is wrong-that scientific thing is wrong." I said, "You don't understand, I'm the guy who invented an atmosphere on Mars. And Caltech invites me back all the time." I said, "You mustn't teach, you must preach. And if you do a good job of preaching, people will go out and buy the book, or go to the library and borrow it, and learn all these wonderful things that you want them to learn. But in the meantime, let me shout."

I said, "What's the one thing that bothers you the most about my script?" They said, "Well, you've got a thing in there about the Big Bang occurring 10 billion years ago." I said, "When did it occur?" They said, "12 billion years ago." I said, "Prove it." Well, that ruined it right there. The marriage was over. So after another two weeks of arguing with these people, I said, "You want to go back to boring people. I don't want to bore people. I want to excite them!" Because it's wonderful to have one life, to be on this world-to have a chance to do the things that we want to do. I said, "How much do you owe me right now?" And they said, "$15,000." I said, "Give me $7,000 and let me go, because this is a bad marriage!" They gave me $7,000. I quit the project. I came out to Los Angeles. I put it in the Air and Space Museum down at Exposition Park. It's still playing there-The Great Shout of the Universe: The Creation of Mankind in the World.

We still don't know-we have various TV shows that we've all seen during the last few years-about how life came upon the earth. And at a certain point, they finally say, "It just did." Well, that's not very scientific, is it? Lightning pummeled the earth, and out of the chemistry of the seas and the oceans and the lakes of the world, suddenly life came. We don't know a damn thing about it.

So in doing my script for the Smithsonian, I looked at the universe, and I said, "I've got a better theory than the Big Bang theory." Do you want to know what that is? I'll tell you what it is. The universe has been here forever. That's impossible too. Big Bang's impossible. But why not, the universe-which is so damn big, billions of light-years in any direction-that it's been here forever. So, that's a hard thing to imagine, isn't it? But we are hard to imagine.

Now a question that has often entered all of your minds-and everyone who lives in the world-at one time or another, is, "Why are we here?" We don't believe in God-we pretend not to believe in God. Well, you've got to believe in the universe, don't you? You have to believe in the universe.

Now, why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. You've been put here because the universe exists. There's no use the universe existing, if there isn't someone there to see it. Your job is to see it. Your job is to witness. To witness; to understand; to comprehend and to celebrate! To celebrate with your lives. At the end of your life, if you don't come to that end and look back and realize that you did not celebrate, then you wasted it.

Your function is God-given. To act on your genetics, to be what you were born to be-find out what it is-and do it. The Armenians have a saying, that in the hour of your birth, God thumbprints thee with a genetic thumbprint in the middle of your forehead. But in the hour of your birth, that thumbprint vanishes back into your flesh. Your job, as young people, is to look in the mirror every day of your life, and see the shape of that genetic thumbprint. And find out just who in the hell you are. It's a big job-but a wonderful job.

So, to be witnesses, to celebrate, and to be part of this universe . . .. you're here one time, you're not coming back. And you owe, don't you? You owe back for the gift of life.

When I was 11 years old, I looked at the back of my hand one day. And I turned my hands over. And I looked at the little hairs on the back of my hand, and I said, "My, God, I'm alive! Why didn't someone tell me? Why didn't someone tell me?" You've all had that moment. Today is one of those moments. You are especially alive. So that you look at yourself, and you say, "I'm in here. I'm looking out. I'm perceiving. And I'm willing to celebrate." Wonderful thing . . . wonderful thing, indeed. And I put that in one of my books. The moment of discovery that you're inside this incredible being, and you're looking out.

Now there are several people sitting here today who will be living on Mars 20 or 30 years from now. I really envy you. I wish I could be alive the day that we land on Mars-with real people. I was out here at Jet Propulsion Lab a few years ago, when the Viking Lander landed. And I was there with Carl Sagan and Bruce Murray, and a lot of other wonderful people. And after the first pictures came back from Mars, Roy Neill at NBC interviewed me. And he said, "Mr. Bradbury, how does it feel? You've been writing about Mars for 30 years; that they have civilizations up there-peculiar people, Martians. And we're up there now, and there's nothing on Mars. There are no cities. There are no Martians. And I said to him, "Fool, fool! There are Martians on Mars-and it is us! From here on in, we will be the Martians." I'd like to believe that on some night, 50, 60 years from now, that when some of you are on Mars, that you'll carry with you-please do-a copy of The Martian Chronicles, which is totally unscientific. It's a Greek myth, it's a Roman myth, it's an Egyptian myth, it's a Norse edda. And that's why the damn thing is still around. I didn't deal with the facts. I dealt with the dream. And some night, teach your children, on Mars, to read the books under the blankets with the flashlight. And in the meantime, they're looking out at Mars, and the only Martians that are out there will be you. I envy you about that.

If the young women here today will permit me to make a little speech to the young men, because you young women already know how to be affectionate to your families. A lot of times you young men have the problems of most young men, with their families and with their fathers. Now this is a very special day today. I want you to do something when the ceremony is over. I have a cousin-a boy cousin. When I was 13 years old, he died suddenly. He got an infection, and he died. And his father was never the same. Never the same. Destroyed the family, but especially his father.

My father came to me when I was 33. I had a job of going overseas, to write the screenplay of Moby Dick, for John Huston. I don't think my father and I had ever embraced each other. I don't remember that we ever said, "I love you." He brought with him, on the day before I went overseas, a gold watch that belonged to my grandfather. And he handed it to me. And his eyes were full of tears. And I realized-and I said to myself, "My God, my God, he loves me. Why didn't I truly realize-why did I have to wait until I was 33, to realize that this man loves me with all his heart." But he just couldn't say-he just couldn't say.

Maybe some of your families are like that. Maybe you're like that. Maybe your father's like that. But think of it, when the celebration's over today. You girls already know-you young women already know what to do. But you young men have to be instructed, to your passions. So when this is over today-I know your fathers are here, most of them. I want you to run over and grab your father, and lift him up, and kiss him on both cheeks, and say, "Dad, thank you for my life. Thank you for being here. I love you." And then you're going to have one of the greatest moments of this graduation. I give you that gift of love, to pass on to your father, when this is over.

Now, one final thing. I'll end with my experience with David Frost. My enthusiasm for space travel is so immense, that when I had a chance to be on the David Frost Show - when we landed on the moon, back in July, 31, 32 years ago-I went over to be on the David Frost Show. And we landed on the moon at 8:30 at night, London time. Now, why did I want to be there? Why is space travel important to me? Because it has to do with the immortality of mankind. If we make it to the moon, if we go on to Mars, if we move on to Alpha Centauri, we have a chance of helping the human race exist on other worlds- 10,000 years from now, 100,000 years, a million years from now. Our children's children's children. I wanted to say that. Space travel has to do with the immortality of the human race. So I got over there, and David Frost said, "I am now going to introduce an American genius." I said, "That's got to be me." And he immediately introduced the next guest, Engelbert Humperdinck. Well, I was very upset. And then he said, "And the next guest after this is Sammy Davis, Jr." And so they both got up and sang their stupid songs. And I walked off the show. Smoke was coming out of my ears.

I didn't have a chance to say what I said to you-that the future belongs to us, if we work with it. And we go back to the moon-we should never have left there in the first place and go on to Mars, and go on out into the universe. So I walked off the show. And the producer came running after me. He said, "What are you doing out here?" And I said, "I'm leaving the show." I said, "That man in there is an idiot. He doesn't realize the most important moment in the history of mankind-our landing on the moon. And he's ruined this special night-this special night. Get me out of here." So they put me in a cab, and I went across London. I did a show with Walter Cronkite. And I was able to say all the things I just said to you. I stayed up all night-I cried all night. I was on four or five different TV shows, on Telstar around the world, being able to say what I've said to you.

And at 9 o'clock in the morning, I walked back across London, very happy and full of cheer, but totally exhausted. And I got out in front of my hotel, and I saw a little, tiny newspaper there. This wonderful, wonderful headline: "The astronauts walk at 6 a.m.- Bradbury walks at midnight."

Thank you very much, thank you.

Distinguished honorees, distinguished guests and the Class of 2000:

Before all else, congratulations!  You finally made it.

Now, however, before you can begin to move on to the next phase of your lives, you must undergo the last grueling hurdle in your career here at Niagara University: the commencement address.

Let me be honest with you about my experiences with commencement addresses.  I’ve been through several of my own, and I’ve sat through dozens of others.  And I can’t recall a single word or phrase from any of those informed, inspirational and seemingly interminable addresses.

This is the second most humbling day of my life.  The first was in 1985.  I was granted an extraordinary opportunity – a private audience with the Holy Father.

I’ll never forget it.  The door opened, and there was the pope dressed in white.  He walked solemnly into the room.  At that time it seemed as large as this auditorium.  I was there to convince His Holiness that it was in his best interest to appear on the “Today” show.  But my thoughts soon turned away from Bryant Gumbel’s career and NBC’s ratings toward the prospect of salvation.  As the Vicar of Christ approached me, you heard this tough, no-nonsense, hard-hitting moderator of “Meet the Press” begin our conversation by saying, “Bless me, Father!”  He took my arm and whispered, “You are the one called Timothy.” I said, “Yes, the man from NBC – yes, yes that’s me.”

“They tell me you are a very important man.”

Somewhat taken aback, I said, “Your Holiness, with all due respect, there are only two of us in this room, and I am certainly a distant second.”

He put his hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eye, and said, “Right.”

In preparing for today, I had thought about presenting a scholarly treatise on news coverage on the private lives of public officials.  But I thought better of it.

I guess I’m like Yogi Berra , I get it eventually.  After Yogi had flunked his exam, his teacher came down the aisle, shook him, and said,  “Don’t you know anything?”  Yogi looked up and said, “I don’t even suspect anything.”

It’s not often you have a chance to meet and talk with people who share the same background and values.  So let me skip the temptation of lecturing you.  Instead, let me take just a very few minutes to have a conversation with you.

I am the first person in my family to have the chance to go to college.  I attended John Carroll University – like Niagara, a Catholic university, where I received an extraordinary education.  And so, too, with you.  You chose a school that was different, and you made the choice deliberately.

The education you’ve received at Niagara isn’t meant to be the same as you could have received at a score of colleges, public and private, across this country.

You’ve been given an education that says it’s not enough to have a skill, not enough to have read all the books or know all the facts.  Values are what really matter.

Niagara University, a Catholic university founded by the Vincentians.  It’s only justification for existing is because it has a special mission.  And that means you now have a special obligation and responsibility.

You have been blessed with extraordinary opportunities.  But, as President Kennedy said, “To whom much is given, much is expected.”

Graduating from Niagara has given you an incredible advantage over others in your generation.

Surprised by that?

I, too, have heard the sometimes-smug remarks about small “Catholic colleges.”

You think you’ve had it bad.  You should try being a Buffalo Bills fan in Washington!  I actually took “Meet the Press” to the Super Bowl a few years back.  At the end of the program, I looked into the camera and said, “It’s now in God’s hands.  And God is good.  And God is just.  Please God, please make three a charm. One time. Go Bills!”

My colleague, Tom Brokaw, turned to me and said, “You Irish Catholics from south Buffalo are shameless.”

Well, as I moped back from the stadium after the Cowboys slipped by the Bills 30-13, the first person I saw was Brokaw.  He yelled across the room, “Hey, Russert, I guess God is a southern Baptist.”

I’ll let you in on a little secret. You’ve got something others would give anything for!

You believe in something – in your God, in your family, in yourself, in your values.

Remember the message our parents and grandparents and teachers repeated and repeated – instilled in us.

A belief that if you worked hard and played fair, things really would turn out all right.

And you know something? After working for senators and governors, meeting popes and interviewing presidents, I think they might be right.

Will Rogers put it this way, “It sure seems funny. The older I get, the smarter my mother and father seem to get.”

The values you have been taught, the struggles you have survived, and the diploma you are about to receive, have prepared you to compete with anybody, anywhere.

Reject the conventional wisdom that success is only for the rich or privileged or Ivy-League educated.

Don’t believe it.  I didn’t, because people with real values have a way of helping and teaching and reaching one another.

People with backgrounds like yours and mine can and will make a difference.

In Poland, it was a young electrician named Lech Walesa, the son of a carpenter, who transformed a nation from communism to democracy.

In South Africa, Nelson Mandela, President Nelson Mandela, a brave black man who worked his way through law school as a police officer, spent 28 years in jail to make one central point: we are all created equal.

Our former governor had it right:

“All these leaders have one thing in common with you. Like the past, the future leaders of the country and this world will be born not to the blood of kings, but to the blood of immigrants and pioneers.”

It is now your turn.  I’m not suggesting you arrest terrorists or even run for public office.  But you will now have the opportunity to be doctors, nurses, therapists, lawyers, accountants, social workers, journalists, businesspeople, or teacher and more.  And in those vital professions, your contributions can be enormous.  You can help save lives, provide prosperity, record history, prevent disease and train young minds.  Yes, you will succeed.  And you will make a difference if you only accept the simple fact that your family and education and values have prepared you for this challenge as well as anyone in this country.

My dad was a truck driver and a sanitation man … He worked two jobs for 37 years. And he never complained. And that was after he helped win WWII. That is the story of his generation.  He never graduated from high school, but he taught me more by his example, by his hard work, by his basic decency; he taught me the true lessons of life.  And it is your grandparents and your parents who defended this country, who built this country, who brought you into this world with a chance to live the American dream.  Will your generation do as much for your children?

You must, and you will!

Remember the words of the American Olympics coach who looked up to his young athletes and said, “I know the experts say you’re underdogs, but you were born to be players.  You were meant to be here, at this time, at this moment.  Seize it.  Do it.  Be the best!”

And did they ever.  They won the gold medal against all odds.

And so, too, with the Niagara University graduates of 2000, you were born to be players in this extraordinary blessing called life.

So go climb that ladder of success and work and live in comfort.  And enjoy yourself.

You earned it.  For that is the American way.

But please, do this world one small favor.

Remember the people struggling along side you and below you, the people who haven’t had the same opportunity, the same blessing, the same education.

No matter what profession you chose, you must try, even in the smallest ways, to improve the quality of life of the children in our country.

We can build more prisons and put more police on the streets, and we will. But unless we instill in our young the most basic skills and cultural values, we will be a very different society in the next century.  We must motivate, inspire – yes, insist that they truly love and respect one another.

But while we are trying to change behavior, we cannot forget those who have not been reached.  We must teach children that they are never, never entitled, but they are always, always loved.  Liberals call it doing good; conservatives call it enlightened self-interest.  No matter what your political philosophy, you know there is a child you can coach, mentor, teach – some are sick, some are lonely, some are uneducated.  Most have little control over their fate.  Give them a hand.  Give them a chance.  Give them their dignity.  Indeed, there is a simple truth: “No exercise is better for the human heart than reaching down to life up another.”

That is your charge.  That is your opportunity.

That’s what it means to be a member of the Class of 2000 of Niagara University.

For the good of all of us, and most important to me, my son, Luke, please build a future we all can be proud of.

You can do it.

Have a wonderful life.  Take care of one another.  Be careful tonight.  God bless, and Go Purple Eagles!


President Vest, members of the Board of Trustees, administration and faculty, distinguished guests, friends and loving families, and most of all, the MIT Class of 2001. I am deeply honored to be here and it is a tremendous privilege to be addressing you today.

When I received the invitation, I told my wife, Judy, immediately. She has an extremely tough job, which she happens to do very well. My wife’s the one who, on occasion, has to bring the NASA chief back to Earth. She kind of shook her head. She told me that MIT’s past commencement speakers have been some of the world’s most powerful people. And then she asked: “Do you really think you can compete with the president of the United States, the UN Secretary General, and Click and Clack, the guys from Car Talk”? Probably not. But I do have one thing going for me: I might not be on the radio every Saturday morning. But I am a rocket scientist.
And if that’s not enough, I told my wife: “You know NASA is famous for fitting a square peg into a round hole. Well, at MIT those outstanding technologists somehow managed to precariously balance an eigt-foot anvil weighing 48 units on top of the Great Dome.” I said, “Don’t worry, honey. These are MY people.”

I would like to start today by telling you a little about the robe I’m wearing. Exactly one year ago today, I was invited to give a lecture at the University of Padua, in Italy, after receiving an honorary doctorate. The University of Padua is where one of my heroes, a professor by the name of Galileo Galilei, built his first telescope.

It was where Galileo made so many celestial discoveries, and it was where he wrote Sidereus Nuncius – Starry Messenger – his book dealing with the satellites of Jupiter and the composition of the Milky Way. The University of Padua – in fact, in the very same room I was so incredibly humbled to speak in – is where Galileo delivered countless lectures to some of the best and brightest students in the world.

Of course, if Galileo were alive today and wanted to speak to the best and the brightest, there is really no doubt he would have to come right here to the Charles River and MIT. It might be hard to lure him from his country of birth. But I think President Vest could do it if the offer was sweet enough. You’d have to promise Galileo he would never have to recant his teachings. And of course, you’d have to offer him tenure.The robe I’m wearing today is what I wore at Padua that day. It is the garb that lecturers have worn at Padua since Galileo’s time. 

Actually, they had to wear this robe and this cap. Contrary to what many of you are thinking, I’m not wearing this because I lost some cruel bet. And I’m not wearing it because I’m the victim of the latest MIT hack. At least not yet.

I wear this cap and gown because I want to give you a visual image. As you lift off from this wonderful institution to explore and discover whatever mysteries life may hold. You may not remember me. But perhaps you will remember the cap and gown.

More than that, I hope that each and every one of you remembers Galileo. Not necessarily his lectures, but his lessons and his life. For as grand as all of Galileo’s discoveries and contributions were, I think his example – what motivated him to live his life he way he did – was really quite simple. He was committed to lifelong learning.

He settled for nothing less than excellence. He not only sought truth; Galileo believed more than anything else that he would find it. I say these are simple notions. I do not want to imply they are easy. Like Galileo, you must have the imagination, the ingenuity and sometimes even the audacity necessary to live your life in this fashion.

You must also realize that the stuff of excellence – truth, real scientific truth – can be elusive. Not just in Galileo’s time, but also in our own as well. It is too often covered by the heavy fog of fear and hidden by the darkness of your detractors.

You must believe in yourself. You must have the desire. You must have the focus to see truth clearly.

That the winner of the Harvard-Yale game every year is MIT tells me that you have the imagination and ingenuity thing covered. And that MIT students once made their president’s office disappear says you have audacity to spare.

As for the second part of the equation, consider it a personal challenge never to let your commitment to learning be denied. To strive for excellence. To believe in yourself and have the ability to prioritize.

Because if you meet that challenge – and I know MIT grads can, and I know MIT grads will – you will be responsible for perhaps the most dramatic revolution in the history of humankind. It is a revolution that will surpass the one that started when Galileo himself first came to cast his gaze skyward. I believe that with all my heart.

Think about this: Over the last 50 years, we have been witness to so many incredible achievements. From jet travel to space travel, from TV to MP3, even from instant coffee to instant messaging. These discoveries and inventions have changed not only the view of our planet and our universe, but our place in it.

Your contribution can blow all the others away. But only if you begin by asking a straightforward question. I’ll even use today’s vernacular: “What have you done for me lately?”

Our aircraft have not improved dramatically since the introduction of the revolutionary Boeing 707, first introduced 40 years ago. Today, the plane’s instruments may have a few more computer chips and a few more lines of code, but basically, we’re flying the same types of planes in the same air space at the same speed. There’s just more of them to burden the system.

We have not had a revolutionary change in the automotive industry in decades. We still cut and grind materials just as we always have. And 32 years after the Eagle landed, we’re still using virtually the same technology to keep our rockets flying.

Even the information technology we’re so rightfully proud of – the kind of systems that make it possible for MIT to show the world the value of education by putting its course materials online and available for free, even those systems are approaching their physical, conceptual and economic limits.

Today’s computers calculate, they don’t think or reason. Information systems are hard and deterministic, not soft and adaptive. With your commitment to learning, with your desire for excellence, with your belief in yourself and your search for truth, all of that’s going to change in the next half century.

In the next 50 years, you will usher in the nano-revolution and discover what is possible when we approach technology – from information systems to materials – at the atomic scale. You will employ what I call “biomimetics.” That’s when we replace traditional technology by mimicking biology or making hybrid systems that integrate biology directly.

Computers will behave more like the human brain. Airplane wings will adapt to different flight conditions, much like a bird’s wings adapt now. Systems will be self-sensing and self-correcting. For you, the silicon-based computer chip will belong in a museum, next to the dinosaurs.

What will all this mean? If excellence and truth are your goals, it will mean the things that Galileo could only dream about.

You will cure today’s diseases and allow people to live to the limits of the bodies they were born with. You will solve global climate changes and make sustainable development a reality. You will send probes beyond our solar system and to the stars. You may look upward and answer the question as old as humankind itself: Are we alone?

And you will make my dream come true. Not in 50 years, but in the next 10 to 20. A spacecraft will land, a hatch will open, a ladder will drop. Then, the world will watch as an astronaut – in a white suit with an American flag on the shoulder – steps down and crunches her boot down on the dusty red surface of Mars.

Are these goals lofty, the dreams big, the missions risky? You bet. And the chances are you will meet your share of detractors.And no doubt, you will encounter some failure along the way.

But remember that Galileo was put under house arrest for his beliefs. People thought he was a heretic. Certainly if you take risks and come up short, it won’t compare to that. Don’t be afraid, get up, dust yourself off and move on.

I’ll tell all of you what I’ve told the NASA employees after we have a failure – that’s usually witnessed by billions of people. Not experiencing any failure in life is rarely a sign of perfection; rather it’s a sign that your goals aren’t bold enough. Hardware can be replaced. The science isn’t being denied, just delayed. Failure is not an option, only if you try to avoid it and refuse to learn from it.

The real mark of your character comes from not how you react to your successes, of which I know there will be many. How you react to your failures, of which there will be, if you are bold, a number in your lifetime. 
So always believe in yourself and remain committed to learning, to excellence, to truth.

That is the lesson of Galileo. It is also a lesson I learned from my father. He would be so proud to see me standing here today. He always spoke fondly of MIT. He would probably ask: “Dan, what’s with the outfit?” But he would be proud nevertheless.

My father died about six years ago: It was right around the time we discovered what we call the Mars Rock. It’s still controversial, but many believe the rock contains fossilized bacteria that originated on Mars, and thus proof of lifeŠ the great debate goes on.

I remember clearly to this day when the three scientists from Houston came into my office and briefed me on their findings. Could you imagine being in charge of NASA and having people come into your office and say: “We think we’ve discovered fossilized life from Mars.” It doesn’t get any better than that.

I couldn’t believe it. I was overwhelmed. I asked every possible question I could think of. My personal inquisition lasted for hours, and when they left, I was convinced we should announce the find, however controversial it was. I felt worldwide peer review was good for science and it was good for young people to witness the scientific process and the intense debate that would go on and still goes on.

That night I couldn’t control my excitement. I had to share the discovery with the man who brought me to the Hayden Planetarium when I was a young boy and introduced me to what became my life’s passion. I called my father in the hospital.

My father graduated from college with a biology degree during the Great Depression – brilliant career choice. He couldn’t get a job for years. He worked for the Post Office, and then ultimately became a teacher, a career he passionately loved.

Even though he was weak and dying from cancer, we spoke for over an hour. He was just as excited as I was. He absorbed everything and asked more questions than I did. I even pretended, “Dad, I know all the answers.”

At the end of the call, I said: “Dad, you have to do me a favor. You can’t tell anybody about this for weeks, at least. This is top secret right now.” My father replied, “Dan, who am I going to tell? Get a grip, I’m in the hospital dying of cancer.”

Well, about a month later, we made the announcement. My father passed within days later. I can’t help but believe that what kept my father alive until that announcement was made, in large part, was his lifelong commitment to learning. He had always sought truth. And he had an irrepressible desire to see his only son do the same.

That somehow I could play, albeit a small role in attempting to solve one of the mysteries of life, literally gave my father more life. That’s the power of truth and learning and excellence. The search for what it is that ignites the human spirit, overcoming the unexpected and discovering the unknown – that’s what life is about.

That’s really what Galileo saw when he looked through his telescopes. And that’s what awaits you.

The cliché goes that you are the future. I contend the future is now. So with imagination, ingenuity and audacity, explore, discover, change the world. And have fun while you’re at it.

Always take time out to love and to live. You’re going to be busy, but never forget family and friends.

In other words, as a parent, on behalf of all the other parents who are here today, please,at least once in a while, don’t forget to check in with old Mission Control. Indulge us.

I mentioned earlier that if Galileo were alive today, he’d want to teach here. In a way, Galileo is here today. In truth, there are 2400 Galileos sitting right in front of me about to get their well-earned degrees. MIT Class of 2001…

With the confidence that you will never, ever have to recant your discoveries, remain committed to learning. Settle for nothing less than excellence. Do not only seek truth. But believe in yourself. That way, you will find truth.

Congratulations and Godspeed to all of you.

Thank you very much for your kind introduction. I am very honored to be with you today as you celebrate a major milestone in your personal and professional lives. As I was reminiscing, in preparation for this commencement address, about the 25 years since I graduated from Penn State, three words kept coming to mind. I would like to share with you today why these words have such a significance to me and hope you find value in their guidance for your own future.

The first word is PREPARED. In my 20-plus years of business experience, I have been fortunate in having the chance to work with literally thousands of engineers, many of whom have had a connection, either directly or indirectly, with Penn State. I am pleased to say that a Penn State education is universally held in high regard. As new graduates, you start your careers with an advantage, not only because of your preparation at Penn State, but also because of the positive perception of the quality of that preparation. I urge you to take full advantage of this competitive edge in seizing opportunities to fulfill your own dreams and those of our society.

Speaking of that, the second word that came to mind is OPPORTUNITY. In today's environment, where rapid changes in technology are the norm, your engineering discipline will afford you many opportunities. In fact, I am somewhat envious of the number of opportunities that will be open to you as you enter and move through your career. As I look back over the number of challenges in my own career since I graduated, I admit, in hindsight, I enjoyed every minute of it and wish I could do it all over again. So I think opportunity is a very appropriate word at this stage in your life. Seize it and, most importantly, enjoy it.

The third word is one I want to spend some time on because of its strong tie, in my belief, to the professional success of an individual and the business success of an organization. It reflects an approach that I have used and continue to use in managing organizations. That word is TEAM. If there is one simple message from my short speech that you will hopefully walk away with today, it is this: the most valuable asset of an organization is its people, and people working together as a TEAM toward a shared vision is key to the success of an organization. Let me repeat that "People working together as a TEAM to accomplish a shared vision is the real key to success." In fact, I believe in this so much that about five years ago I integrated the many "lessons learned" from mentors and colleagues over several decades to develop a half-day training course that I call TEAM Training. I use this training session to communicate to my senior managers the pivotal values that are necessary to foster a TEAM environment and, thus, a successful organization.

To put a vision to these values, I would like to focus on the word, TEAM, itself, starting with the first letter "T." T stands for Thinking Strategically. No organization can be successful without understanding and--more importantly--constantly reinforcing its employees' understanding of its long-term goals. To think strategically means setting an objective for the future and focusing on that objective in daily decisions. A simple illustration is the compass that indicates in which direction you are heading. An organization that implements a TEAM approach among its employees may set its future vision to head due north. If the organization then comes to a detour in the road that steers it east or west (maybe a change in technology, a shift in its customer base or loss of key personnel), it uses that compass--its future vision--to get back on track. As an employee and member of the organizational team, it is important that you understand the strategic direction of your organization and benchmark your daily decisions against that long-term direction.

A story I once heard effectively illustrates this. An individual was walking down the street and saw a gentleman in front of him complaining and chipping away on some stones. He walked up and said, "Hi, what are you doing?" The gentleman grumbled, "What's it look like? I'm building a stone wall." As he walked away, the individual thought to himself, "Boy, he must hate his job." He continued down the street and saw a second gentleman chipping stones. So he thought he would give it another try. And he said, "Hi, what are you doing?" This gentleman looked at him and said, "Well, I'm building a cathedral." Wow, what a difference! The first gentleman saw only the small task in front of him, but the second was thinking strategically and understood that he was an important part of a larger master plan. And this is what I hope each of you will do. Take a key role in your organization, think strategically, understand how you fit into the overall master plan, and work hard to help the organizational team achieve its long-term goals.

The second letter of TEAM is "E" as in EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES. Empowerment is a word that has, in my opinion, been over-used. To me, it means providing the support and infrastructure that enables employees to be successful in implementing their organizational responsibilities. It does not mean that we allow everyone to do whatever it is they want to do; it does mean that we help employees to be creative and use their skill sets to accomplish the task they have been given, within the context of the overall strategic goals of the organization. In short, empowerment is a two-way street. From the management side, empowerment means train, retain, motivate and facilitate. From the employee side--and from your perspective as future employees--empowerment means taking responsibility in decision-making and action-taking, always keeping in view the long-term goals of your organization. Unfortunately, people too often shy away from responsibility in the workplace, particularly when challenged with new problems or tasks. I encourage you to step out of the box, step up to your responsibilities, and be proactive in meeting the organization's strategic goals … but with one note of caution. Always make sure you define your reality in line with the TEAM approach.

I am reminded here of a story of a company that was facing significant challenges and undergoing a lot of changes. As a result, a number of its employees lost touch with reality. The company sent the employees to a support facility to go through some therapy. To determine how effective the therapy sessions were in improving the ability of employees to get in touch with reality, the therapists conducted a simple test. They asked each employee the question: "What is 3X7?" The first employee answered: "3X7 is 485." Oh my, not in touch with reality here! The response of the second employee tested was "3X7 is Wednesday." Oh my goodness, we're getting worse. When the third employee was asked "'What's 3x7?", his answer was "21." Well, the therapists were very happy with themselves, believing that they had really helped this particular employee…that is, until someone said, "We ought to ask him how we helped him to get that right answer." So they queried him, and he said: "It was a simple question to answer. I just divided 485 by Wednesday." Well, you see one person's reality is not always another's, and I think it is important that, as professionals on an organizational team, you are all working toward a common goal, that you take responsibility for the empowerment given to you, and that you make sure you take that responsibility seriously.

The third letter of TEAM, the letter "A," I define as Acting Responsively. This doesn't mean working fast; this means being responsive to a stated need. It may be required tomorrow, next week, next year, or in the next decade, but you want to be responsive to the requirements of your customers, your business and your colleagues. I am sure none of you have ever, ever put that term paper off until the week before it was due, even though you knew about it for three months. But I think to be successful as a member of an organizational team, you do have to be responsive. And acting responsively, from an individual point of view, means prioritizing…making sure that you are tackling the high priority tasks first. In a seminar I once attended, a consultant addressing "effective time management" made a powerful point by pulling out a glass and putting about 5 or 6 large-sized rocks in it, asking the audience the question, "Is this glass full?" About half the people in our audience raised their hands, saying yes. He said, "No, it's not," and poured some gravel inside the glass. Again he asked the audience if the glass was full. This time, however, no one wanted to raise his hand. So, he poured some sand into the glass and asked, "Now is it full?" Again, no takers. Finally, he poured water into the glass until it went right to the brim. At that point he did say, "Yes, the glass is full." But when someone from the audience asked, "What is the moral of that story?", the consultant replied "It's simple. Put the big rocks in first." I think that is an excellent illustration of prioritization. Make sure you tackle the big items first, because if you fill up with all those small tasks that aren't quite as critical, you won't have time-or room--to tackle the big ones. So, remember that acting responsively means that you continually prioritize to the most critical task at hand.

Finally we come to "M"-the last letter in TEAM. My definition for M is Make Success Happen. And that's really the goal here, working together as a team to achieve success. From an organizational perspective, success is defined as meeting financial and business objectives, such as satisfying customers so they will keep coming back, and allowing employees to fulfill their professional and personal needs so that they will be motivated to continue to achieve.

As an individual, however, you need to clearly define success--both in the workplace and outside the workplace--in your own terms, whether that success is defined as having two kids and a dog, solving some huge engineering problem that's never been solved, or owning your own business. And one last piece of advice--make sure you do not have just one major success set for yourself in life. Define and enjoy many small successes along the way. Remember: the road to success can be much more fun than success itself.

And today is one of those milestones that represents a clearly defined success in your life. Make sure that you enjoy it to its fullest. I wish you all happiness, the courage to meet life's many challenges, and the experience of success, both individually and as a member of an organizational team. Good luck and thank you. 

Thank you, President Fergusson—Trustees—members of the faculty—family members—and—of course—you graduates of 2001.

Last week, this week, next week; all over America young men and women—and some not so young—in caps and gowns are listening to scholars, politicians, eminent thinkers, and probably Oprah Winfrey send them forth into their lives. You here at Vassar have invited the man most commonly seen as America's Bogeyman to do that, and I have to ask you What were you thinking? What in God's name were you thinking?

Possibly that I'd take the day off and paint you a shining picture—"shining," get it? that one's mine—of a glorious American future where George W. Bush rules like Glinda the Good, with Dick Cheney at his right hand and John Ashcroft at his left? Not going to happen. Dubya may be the Wizard of Oz but he's no Glinda, and the bogeyman never takes the day off. I guess no one told you that. . . and now it's too late.

In that spirit, I invite you now to take a look around and imprint this cheerful scene on your mind. Make it a mental Kodak Moment. Have you got it? Okay, now close your eyes. Seriously, Nothing will bite you. All I want you to do is to see what you were just looking at with your eyes open.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, cast your minds a hundred years into the future. It's May 20, 2101. Imagine this stage and these same folding chairs on this same lawn, but now there's a sign over the stage that says VASSAR WELCOMES THE SURVIVORS OF THE 2001 COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES. Keep your eyes shut just a moment longer, okay? They've put out a chair for everyone that's here today. One for each student, parent, grandparent, sibling; one for each faculty member and invited guest. Do you see those chairs? Sure you do. Your imagination is getting a great view of them. Because if we returned a hundred years from today, we wouldn't need to hold the festivities on this lawn; we could get everyone left into the newsstand at the Courtyard Marriott out on Route 9.

We're looking at some marvelous medical advances over the next hundred years—most cancers will be treatable and beatable, at least for those who have the resources; with genetic tailoring, a good many children may actually be born cancer-immune…but none of those wonder-children are here today. We have incredible new drugs to protect against stroke and heart attack—drugs which should be almost unnecessary, given what we now know about the lifestyle markers leading up to stroke and heart attack, but what we know and how we behave are often divergent paths, aren't they? Human nature is for the most part an alligator that just wants to doze in the sun and snatch whatever prey happens to wander too close. We know too much cholesterol is bad for us, but God I love a box of french fries. And I'm not the only one.

Our pills and treatments are largely designed to work in spite of human nature, and more and more often they actually do that. Given what we now know about the human genome, there are apt to be even more striking advances over the coming decades, some of which we can foresee now no more than the visionaries of 1970, when I graduated college, could foresee America's amazing transition from a purveyor of goods to a purveyor of information. The land of big shoulders has become the land of smart guys and gals with pens in their pockets, CD players in their computers, and beepers on their belts. Hardly anyone saw it coming, but here it is.

What I'm saying is that I don't see all empty chairs when I close my eyes. I do believe that there are people here today who could still come to a reunion a hundred years from today, but as I say, I think you'd hardly need this lawn to accommodate them. Since we started today, have you heard the occasional cry of a baby? Some young American more interested in eating or getting into a dry diaper than in listening to all this rhetoric? I'd suggest that those few crying babies are your most likely hundred-year survivors—always assuming the world itself continues to survive—and while a few of them might show up in wheelchairs or on walkers, I'll bet many would be tres spry. Alzheimer's? Nah. Most of them will have ninth-generation computer chips in their heads, serving as firewalls against that problem. Diabetes? Maybe, but those who have lost limbs to the disease will have computer-driven prosthetics which have complete range of motion and even feeling—they'll occasionally itch, and go numb if you fall asleep in the wrong position.

So there will be hundred-year survivors. But I have to tell you the scary truth, because that's my job. You know the old proverb, don't you, about the woman who carries the drowning scorpion across the raging stream? Once they're on the other side it stings her and as she staggers to her knees, dying, she reproaches it for ingratitude. "C'mon, lady," it says, "you knew I was a scorpion when you picked me up." And you knew I was the scary guy when you picked me for this job, so deal with it.

Any trustees, Board of Directors, faculty, at our one-hundred-year get-together in 2101? Maybe a couple of faculty. We'll be generous and say two. But they're in their hundred-and-thirties and not much good in a game of Frisbee. Grandparents? Gone, of course. Aunts and uncles? Gone. Parents? With maybe a couple of exceptions, gone. Graduates? Let's be generous here. Fourteen surviving members of the class of 2001. Men and women ranging in ages from one hundred and nineteen, let us say, to a hundred and twenty-two. Many more little brothers and sisters—except by 2101, the annoying little brothers and sisters are going to be old, gray, slow, and cranky. And those crying babies, of course.

Now I'm sure that there are those—I hope their number is small, but I'm sure they're out there—who feel that I am being tasteless, casting gloom—even the pall of death—on what should be a joyous and wonderful day. Let me respond by reiterating the obvious: you knew I was a scorpion when you picked me up. And I do have a point to make. Because I do, I apologize not at all for pointing out the simple fact of your mortality on the day of your commencement.

Let us suppose the world has that coming century. Let's suppose no one decides it's time to start the next nuclear exchange in Pakistan or Jerusalem or Kansas City. Let us suppose you go forth from this happy place in good health and no one drops a safe on your head, hits you with a taxicab, or dumps you out of a hot-air balloon. Let us suppose cancer misses you, that you continue to run and work out and avoid Mickey D's and your heart grows stronger as the years get longer. Let's suppose you are fortunate enough to land the job you want the friends you love (and who love you) and maybe even a life's mate that you can reach over and touch in the night when the hours spin long and you've got the blues. Let's suppose you have those years, that fullness of time. I wish that for you. I do. I wish you the passion of this springtime, a long and productive summer, and a harvest ripe beyond your dreams come fall. I do. But you have to think about what I'm talking about. There's a Jackson Browne song, "The Pretender," that goes, "I'm aware of the time passin' by, they say in the end it's the blink of an eye." They say, and it's true. Time is short.

That human life is brief when placed in time's wider perspective is something we all know. I am asking you to consider it on a more visceral level, that's all. Thinking of all those empty chairs a hundred years from now is frightening. Yet it also offers some valuable perspective.

What are you going to do, Vassar oh-one? Who will be the doctors, the lawyers, the writers, the painters, the executives, the politicians? Who's going to look around at age forty-five, surprised as hell to find himself or herself the head concierge at the Hotel Carlyle in New York and say, "How in the hell did I wind up here?"

What will you do? Well, I'll tell you one thing you're not going to do, and that's take it with you. I'm worth I don't exactly know how many millions of dollars—I'm still in the Third World compared to Bill Gates, but on the whole I'm doing okay—and a couple of years ago I found out what "you can't take it with you" means. I found out while I was lying in the ditch at the side of a country road, covered with mud and blood and with the tibia of my right leg poking out the side of my jeans like the branch of a tree taken down in a thunderstorm. I had a MasterCard in my wallet, but when you're lying in the ditch with broken glass in your hair, no one accepts MasterCard. If you find yourself in the ER with a serious infarct, or if the doctor tells you yeah, that lump you felt in your breast is a tumor, you can't wave your Diners Club at it and make it go away. My life, as it happened, was saved. The man who saved it was a volunteer EMT named Paul Fillebrown. He did the things that needed to be done at the scene, and then he drove me to the nearest hospital at a hundred and ten miles an hour. And while Paul Fillebrown may have an American Express Card, I doubt very much if it's a gold one, or God save us, the black one that offers double Frequent Flyer miles and special deals at Club Med.

We all know that life is ephemeral, but on that particular day and in the months that followed, I got a painful but extremely valuable look at life's simple backstage truths, We come in naked and broke. We may be dressed when we go out, but we're just as broke. Warren Buffet? Going to go out broke. Bill Gates? Going to go out broke. Tom Hanks? Going out broke. President Fergusson? Broke. Steve King? Broke. You guys? Broke. Not a crying dime. And how long in between? How long have you got to be in the chips? "I'm aware of the time passin' by, they say in the end it's the blink of an eye." That's how long. Just the blink of an eye.

Let me give you some rough numbers, okay? The class of 2001, if everyone graduated on time, would consist of six hundred and twenty-four men and women. But things come up and a probably a fewer number will actually get diplomas today. Say six hundred. Now let's take an average year's salary for a Vassar graduate—and when I say average, I mean knocked down to reflect the scuffling early years, when you won't be paid what you're really worth and won't care—if you're normal, in those early years you're going to care more about seeing U-2 or Wilco in concert. So we'll say forty-one grand. Now let's say each of you works forty years. Given those marvelous medical advances we were talking about, many of you may work longer, but let's be conservative. Forty years. Given these numbers—these very conservative numbers—this class as a group can expect to earn 984 million dollars during its active years in the American economy. These are still not Bill Gates numbers, but we need to remember that Vassar is only one of the many good schools graduating seniors today. Almost a billion dollars. And so what? I'm aware of the time passin' by, they say in the end it's the blink of an eye, and the scary man said I was going to go out broke. The scary man actually says more than that. The scary man says all the money you will earn, all the credit you will swing like Tom Sawyer's dead cat on a string, all the stocks you will buy, all the mutual funds and precious metals you will trade—all of that is mostly smoke and mirrors. You will continue to put on your pants one leg at a time no matter how many T-bills you have or how many shares of General Electric in your portfolio. It's still going to be quarter-past getting late whether you tell the time on a Timex or a Rolex. No matter how large your bank account, your kids will still play their music too loud when you get to be my age. No matter how many credit cards you have, sooner or later things will begin to go wrong with the only three things you have which you can really call your own: your body, your spirit, and your mind.

Yet for a short period—let's say forty years, but the merest blink in the larger course of things—you and your contemporaries will wield enormous power: the power of the economy, the power of the hugest military-industrial complex in the history of the world, the power of the American society you will create in your own image. That's your time, your moment. Don't miss it. I think my generation did, although I don't blame us too much; it's over in the blink of an eye and it's easy to miss.

Of all the power which will shortly come into your hands—gradually at first, but then with a speed that will take your breath away—the greatest is undoubtedly the power of compassion, the ability to give. We have enormous resources in this country—resources you yourselves will soon command—but they are only yours on loan. Only yours to give for a short while. You'll die broke. In the end, it's the blink of an eye. I came here to talk about charity, and I want you to think about it on a large scale.

Should you give away what you have? Of course you should. I want you to consider making your lives one long gift to others, and why not? All you have is on loan, anyway. All you want to get at the getting place, from the Maserati you may dream about to the retirement fund some broker will try to sell you on, none of that is real. All that lasts is what you pass on. The rest is smoke and mirrors.

Don't I think wealth—and some of you are going to finish up very wealthy, although you may not think it now—should be kept in the family? Some, yes—charity begins at home. Those of you who have been able to pay for the college educations of your sons and daughters—their Vassar educations—have done a wonderful thing. It's a great gift. If you're able to go on and give them a further start in life—a place in business, possibly help with a home—so much the better. Because charity begins at home. Because—up to a certain point, at least—we are all responsible for the lives we add to the world. But I think the most chilling thing a young man or woman can hear is "Some day all this will be yours." And of course, the runner-up: "I do it all for you." I think what a lot of new grads would like to hear is some version of, "You're on your own, good luck, call if you need help. And reverse the charges."

Here's another scary thing to think about before you leave here. Imagine a nice little back yard, surrounded by a board fence. Dad—a pleasant fellow, a little plump, wearing an apron that says YOU MAY KISS THE COOK—is tending the barbecue. Mom and the kids are setting the picnic table by the backyard pool: fried chicken, cole slaw, potato salad, a chocolate cake for dessert. And standing around that fence, looking in, are emaciated men and women, starving children. They are silent. They only watch. That family at the picnic is us, ladies and gentlemen; that back yard is America, and those hungry people on the other side of the fence, watching us sit down to eat, include far too much of the rest of the world. It's Asia and the subcontinent; it's countries in Central Europe where people live on the edge from one harvest to the next; it's South America, where they'[re burning down the rainforests to make room for housing developments and for grazing lands where next year's Big Macs are now being raised; most of all it's Africa, where AIDS is pandemic—not epidemic but pandemic—and starvation is a fact of life. Am I overstating? Well, America contains five percent of the world's population and uses up seventy-five percent of the world's resources, so you tell me. What we scrape down the kitchen disposal after Thanksgiving dinner for a family of eight would feed a Liberian village for a week, so you tell me. And the Woodstock Generation, which set out to change the world, has, by and large, subsided into a TV-driven existence of quiet and unobtrusive selfishness. While our national worth has tripled over the last quarter-century, the help we give the world's poor has sunk back to 1973 levels, so you tell me, you dare to tell me I'm overstating the case." In West Africa, the average lifespan is thirty-nine years. Infant mortality in the first year is fifteen percent. It's not a pretty picture, but we have the power to help, the power to change. And why should we refuse? Because we're going to take it with us? Please.

We've elected an administration—I guess we elected them, we might as well say we did—that takes a dim view of charity as national policy. George W. Bush talks about "compassionate conservatism," an oxymoron right up there with "jumbo shrimp." What he's talking about has been Republican Party bedrock for a hundred years; it amounts to, "Don't give a man a fish, give him a fishing pole and teach him to fish." (This, of course, would be before idiotic conservation and environmental policies render the whole concept of "fish" irrelevant.) My own philosophy—partly formed as a young college graduate without a job waiting in line to get donated commodities for the kids—is by all means give a man a pole and teach him to fish, but people learn better with full bellies. Why not give him a fish to get started?

Giving isn't about the receiver or the gift but the giver. It's for the giver. One doesn't open one's wallet to improve the world, although it's nice when that happens; one does it to improve one's self. I give because it's the only concrete way I have of saying that I'm glad to be alive and that I can earn my daily bread doing what I love. I hope that you will be similarly grateful to be alive and that you will also be glad to do whatever it is you wind up doing…even that guy who's going to end up as the concierge at the Carlyle Hotel. Giving is a way of taking the focus off the money we make and putting it back where it belongs—on the lives we lead, the families we raise, the communities which nurture us.

I wish you the most pleasant day—both graduates and families. I wish you the joy of your fellowship, one with the other. This isn't a hundred years from now, after all; it's just today, and today we're fine. Today nobody's better than us. But when you go somewhere and sit down to break bread with your families, as most of you will, I want you to remember that image of the hungry and the dispossessed standing on the other side of the backyard fence. For the most part, they do not want to harm you, or take away your joy in this day; they only want what you want and we all want: food for themselves and their children, clothes for the body, a roof to keep the rain off at night. There are people who need these things right here in Poughkeepsie, as well as in India and Sierra Leone. Many of you know that; in April of this year, Vassar College held a panel discussion called "Faces of Homelessness."

Dutchess Outreach is one local organization dedicated to helping the hungry, the sick, and the homeless. They're at 70 South Hamilton Street, near a part of town which is very different from this green and pleasant campus, a part of Poughkeepsie where you might feel uncomfortable walking at night. Dutchess Outreach runs an Emergency Food Bank for those who are hungry and have nothing to eat. They run something called the Lunch Box, which serves midday meals six days a week. They have a Children's Clothes Closet for kids who need pants and coats and shoes. They provide nutrition, information, and emergency services for people with AIDS.

I don't as a rule talk about charitable giving; I actually do happen to believe that the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing…or if it does, it shouldn't discuss it. Today I'm going to make an exception to that rule. I intend to give $20,000 to Dutchess Outreach, in honor of the Class of 2001. I would take it kindly if those of you who are here today would help to match that amount. Each strictly according to his or her resources; nobody gets hurt. I don't ask that you do this because it will solve the problem of hunger and want in Poughkeepsie or Dutchess County, let alone in the whole world, but because you'll enjoy your own coming meal more fully knowing that you shared your joy and your good fortune in having been a part of this happy occasion. And don't let it be a one-shot. Let it be the beginning of a life's giving, not just of money but of time and spirit. It repays. Not least of all because it helps us remember that we may be going out broke, but right now we're doing okay. Right now we have the power to do great good for others and for ourselves. So I ask you to begin the next great phase of your life by giving, and to continue as you begin. I think you'll find in the end that you got far more than you ever had, and did more good than you ever dreamed.

Thank you.



You know, I never write a speech because I feel that when you write something, you go long. But for this one, I wrote one, and if it goes long, I might just stop in the middle of it and start playing. Now, this is kind of new; I've never actually read one, so excuse me while I try to find my right, proper angle.

Acting President Lewis, President Gaudiani, students, friends, family, boys and girls, Boss Jeter, Wyn and Simeon:

As you now sit in full bloom of youth, ingest the sweetness of this communal moment in celebration of your academic achievement. I want you all to bathe in this moment as if it were the noonday sun, which as you can see is not going to come out today. Look around at family and friends and savor what you all have accomplished. All, bask in the afterglow of good feeling as this day wears on and you end up sloshing through today's and tonight's and, in some exceptionally festive cases, next week's parties. Get as close to your freshly educated feelings and thoughts as you can stand to be without overdosing on your own magnificence. Lord, have mercy. Feel the full weight and power of your presence and enjoy the respect due one who has survived this four-year baptism by book.

But before you remove your cap and your gown today, I want you to go inside yourself and reflect on who you are and want to be in the world out here: big, chaotic and not-giving-a-damn world who is no respecter of people large or small. Take stock of your graduation day clichés: 'You will change the world with the incorruptible strength of your personal integrity,' Your unquenchable thirst for justice,' 'your unwavering courage in the face of an uniformed public duped by lying leaders and an even more lying media.' Savor these last sublime moments of parents financing your rebellion against them. Savor this. Remember this day, May 26th 2001, and remember how you're going to combat world hunger, desegregate the schools, attack commercialism, sexism, fascism, racism and every other kind of 'ism,' because there's a bunch of 'isms' that haven't been found yet. Remember that you're going to get rich, be famous, be respected in your field, find the perfect spouse, get a great job and have wonderfully well behaved and mannerly children. Brothers and sisters, revel in the last days of babyhood. All, I look out and I can even see without the sun shining down on us that all of you have a shine, a glow; you possess the eternal optimism of the untried, the untested, the inexperienced, the unimpressed. Check yourself out, cause it's a beautiful thing.

And someday soon - maybe today - someone who you don't know will ask you, "Where did you go to school? When did you finish?" And you will smile and say, "Connecticut College '01," and they will smile and say, "Wow! You're so young," and you'll smile, too.

And you'll go on from this blissful time so pregnant with possibility, armed with a diploma, into the unruly, vulgar mass of competition, political intrigue, backstabbing and street level hustle known as the workforce.

All, you'll get the perfect job and the worse job, you will be promoted and you will be fired (never justified, never your fault) over the dumbest thing. You'll become rich and impoverished; your heart will sprout wings and it will cry; you will marry and you're going to divorce. You will have children or not. You will experience unspeakable joy and tragedy beyond tears.

Yes, Brothers and Sisters, someone will come up to you and ask you, "Where did you go to school and when did you graduate?" and you will say, "Connecticut College '01," and they will say, "Hmm! You don't look that old," and you will smile and reply, "Thank you." But now, many of us will no longer shine and glow of youthful optimism to the point of arrogance. Oh no, many of us will bend our integrity to the times or the situation. Many of us will thirst for justice and equality only when our own throats are parched; many of us will lose our sense of outrage as "ism" after "ism" is justified through repetition, redefinition, then dismissal. After all, we have a lot to protect: our jobs, our kids, our homes, our standing in the community, our very fundamental way of living. But still there will be those bloodhounds amongst us that never lose the scent of this day. I can look out and point you all out, almost; they're going to and pursue and pursue and pursue and they're going to find. There will be those shining individuals that remember May 26, 2001, and the promises born of youthful naiveté. They will stand firm in the batter's box — we're talking about baseball, and Mrs. Robinson is here - left- or right-handed, still swinging for the fences though life has thrown curve after curve after curve for strike after strike after unhittable strike. And further on we all shall go; those who strike out and those who strike.

Before removing your cap and gown today, I want you all to look again upon your parents and grandparents and your step-parents. I want you to look real close and recognize yourself in them. And you know what? If you really don't see it because you're too lost in yourself, I want you to look a little closer or step a little further away. In full bloom and youth of life, take stock of time and the passing of time. And as you are promoted or demoted, as you purchase cars and computers and homes and trinkets and pay mortgages and alimony and child support, or not; as you skillfully scale the slippery slopes of success or fail as you gossip and backstab, and connive or remain stoically silent and advise; as you rush life away to get ahead or lazily slump and fall far behind, take stock of time. 

You will be told that 'time is your greatest enemy, time is your greatest possession. Hey, you better be careful with time because time don't come back'; "Time flies" "Time is of the essence" "Don't waste time" "You must control your time" and, above all else, "Be on time - Be on time." Well, friends, in the words of the great Louisiana jazz trumpet man, Enute Johnson, "Son, don't worry about being on time, be in time." Because when you are "in" time, you can accept and experience a much larger slice of life as it unfolds. Instead of imposing your will on every situation, you focus on including everyone else, and just that little adjustment of attitude gives you the space to understand where and who you are.

You see, time is actually your friend. He don't come back because he never goes away. And you will go on. And you will see your kids graduate or not, and your candidate will win or not Ð or get cheated even; sometimes that happens Ð and you will gain too much weight or you'll lose some; your husband will or won't get caught; your kids will elate or disappoint you; you will stay or move to Florida; and you will defend a corruption (to protect your earnings, of course) with philosophy, prose and politics, and your kids will not agree, and you will blame it on their youth. You will see them graduate or not and some other too-long speaker will attempt to inspire your kids to embrace life with some set of principles or laws or rules that will or won't work and you will look at your kids and grandkids and assess this very moment that we're in right now as an achievement once again in your life. And they in the full bloom of youth will look past you to their friends and their future. And you will finance their rebellion against you.

Will you, when your kids and grandkids sit here, will you be still in the full bloom of youth? Will you be still steadfast in your integrity, bubbling and seething with anger over the "isms" that need to be confronted, arrogant and unimpressed by things large and small? Will you be on the firing line with the same zeal you possess right here today? Or will you be broken by the unceasing pressure of the crass, the commercial, the garish, the vile, the reprehensible and the ugly? Will you follow the much-decorated heroes of fraud and corruption and imitate the flaws of your nation and the flaws of your time? Or will you remember and shine with the glow of expectation and excitement for possibility of improvement?

Your daughter or granddaughter on their graduation day, will you sit fattened and blinded by a life of conformity and hoarding of wealth, battered and broken by the bone-crushing grip of personal folly, forced to pin all of your most precious and sacred aspirations on the head of a child too young to marry and too light to carry your leftover dreams? This is a one-time ceremony. Before you take off your cap and your gown and declare your individuality, perhaps through some clichéd and ill-timed act of irreverence, look around and see. Because in this perfect moment, mother and daughter are as one in memory and realization that what was, is, and what is, will be. So as you graduate and momma and grandmomma all beam and shine with the excitement of what is to come, as you celebrate education as a way to achieve greater glory for civilization, all here today under the gloomy skies still possess an eternal optimism unaffected by the passage of time. You hope as your parents hoped and as your children will hope, and all, on a day like this, will be proud.

Now, you have been told that your greatest possession is time; once it's gone you don't get it back. But today it is once again affirmed that your greatest possession is actually optimism. We're optimistic that it will not rain. Optimism is why we wake up all across the globe and initiate sons and daughters and grandkids into the ascendant journey towards knowledge. And this very initiation is also a part of momma and daddy and grandmomma's education, too.Yes, you are glowing today, grandpa, and someone is going to ask you, "Are you an alumnus?" and you will say, "Connecticut College, Class of '01," and they will think, "Damn! You're old," but they're going to say, "Man, you're looking good, Pops," and you will smile and say, "Thank you." ***** But you realize that these are the last days of babyhood and be ye saint or sinner or both you see through your generations that what you have done or not done will continue to be not done and done by your sons and grandsons because time does not pass — we do. But we also continue as teachers continue through their students. Shakespeare said it so well: "To be, or not be: that is the question:" and the answer is — yes, the great I AM of affirmation.

So realize this, graduate of the great Connecticut College Noble Class of '01: as you pass through time with your righteous anger or unquestioning acceptance of dogma or even indifference to the great spanking board of life that will greet both of your cheeks quite happily and humbly quite soon, it is not money, or fame, or respect, or tradition or hard work that has brought you here today. It is the blue-edged blade of love and him cut sharp both ways — the bitter and the sweet. And when he cut you deep in your heart and knock you to your senses, I don't want you to cry or shout or curse. Sing! Sing and make it a song with some soul; make it your song — then you will sing for all of us. The Old Bard said that, too. He said: "to thine own self be true." But, really, the old Mississippi bluesman Hoghead Harris said it best:

"It's out there for you Baby. I got mine."

Strange though it may seem, your education today is the culmination of the education of your parents: the heroic sacrificial act of love that is raising kids ends today! They have put their youngsters through college. So I don't want you all to be too cynical when you look out on your future. We're all here on the last rung of your education, graduate, it is to know yourself and sing for us a song that has never been heard: your song. And when you come to know yourself and to believe in our collective humanity so abundantly evident right here today; when you act on the basis of all the spiritual legacies that have been passed down to us from every corner of the globe, where some kind of song was sung to free the human spirit; when you share your song with us, well, we might just end up feeling as though we are reborn as children, singing ourselves with such freedom that our lives — long-ago shattered — could sprout new wings and fly. In the words of the great bluesman Hoghead Harris, "Ain't nothing wrong with living, but dying." So in closing, I am going to read a poetic passage from a book entitled, "There is a tree more ancient than Eden" written by Leon Forrest. And I'm only reading it because to make a good speech, you have to read some type of quote. Now, this passage is somewhat difficult to understand, but it speaks of the types of demons that you will face and it tells us of the optimism that makes life ironic and transcendent. Place this optimism right next to your diploma because, believe me, you're going to need it.

"And I shuddered and trembled as we fairly floated past this building from which they had flown into space: rocketed, sacrificed, yoked and bedazzled, raggedy, transfixed, auctioned, looted and howling scarecrows into the breathing jungles of this soft and easy, stormy out-of-Eden country, funky-jawed and joy-ripping, grease trapped, babbling wind... and in the extreme right corner two mammoth bloodhounds lapped, tongued and gnawed down the bony skeletons and the nostril-gutting spoils of this building's bowels bursting like water bags, cast away from its moorings to land-lostness and humpback prayers spinning amid hovels and clapboard whispers of dreams and citadels, psalms, bales of cotton - laughing to mouth down the bad yoke, which weaves its way through the house built upon pale riggings of a vessel afire in a docking bay, which had become a castle for rats, making potlicker of the blood, flesh, feces, skeletons, eyes, ears and throat and tongue of the looted, discarded shipwrecked spoils in the bowels of the swinish hole... Ah but the little children piedpipered in their pitch, from where they knew not/whereof and plunged down sining as if they were back in the low red-clay country and stealing up now and winging off, and then vaulting over the pale ghost of a harpooned yet thunderously devouring sun in flight - as if even in their looted youth they were possessed by wings."

And that's what it's about, Brothers and Sisters. So, when they ask you, "Where did you come from, when did you graduate?" and you say, "Connecticut College, '01," and they think to themselves, "I didn't even know they had colleges back then," smile to yourself that grim grin of recognition and know, in the words of the great bluesman, Hoghead Harris, "It's alright, Baby, it's alright."

Wow. What a privilege to be with you all. Since I've arrived here in Hanover many people have greeted me by saying, "It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood." Well, indeed it is a beautiful day. But before I begin, I'd like you to know that I recognize that you who live and work here have had many days, particularly during these last several months, that have been far from beautiful. You've had a painful time and you've handled it with dignity. I feel certain that the Zantops' generous spirits inspire you and it's a great privilege for me to be with you all. *


When I was at Dartmouth in the late 1940's, the tuition, room, and board all added up to $1100 a year. Nobody owned a home computer and hardly anyone had a television set and for those who did, there was a choice of three channels. I'm not sure if Jeanne Shaheen was even born yet, but very few people would have guessed that within 50 years a woman would be governor of New Hampshire. Yes, when I was here the first word of the alma mater was "Men…Men of Dartmouth, give a rouse…". Well, now the first word is "Dear". Some things change for the better.


During my first year here, I lived right over there at 101 Middle Mass. And I had two roommates. I had a professor over there who did his best to scare everyone in his class and he gave me the lowest grade that I ever had in any school anywhere. But I also had an astronomy professor, George Dimitrov, who looked for and found what was best in each of his students. When I look at the night sky, I still think of that extra-special, kind man.


Dartmouth is many things to each of us and I'm grateful to Jim and Susan Wright for all that they have done for this school. And I'm grateful to my old friend Chick Koop for all that he has done for all of us. And I congratulate every one of you who is being honored in any way during this Commencement weekend.


Our world hangs like a magnificent jewel in the vastness of space. Every one of us is a part of that jewel. A facet of that jewel. And in the perspective of infinity, our differences are infinitesimal. We are intimately related. May we never even pretend that we are not. Have you heard my favorite story that came from the Seattle Special Olympics? Well, for the 100-yard dash there were nine contestants, all of them so-called physically or mentally disabled. All nine of them assembled at the starting line and at the sound of the gun, they took off. But not long afterward one little boy stumbled and fell and hurt his knee and began to cry. The other eight children heard him crying; they slowed down, turned around and ran back to him. Every one of them ran back to him. One little girl with Down Syndrome bent down and kissed the boy and said, "This'll make it better." And the little boy got up and he the rest of the runners linked their arms together and joyfully walked to the finish line. They all finished the race at the same time. And when they did, everyone in that stadium stood up and clapped and whistled and cheered for a long, long, time. People who were there are still telling the story with great delight. And you know why. Because deep down, we know that what matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What really matters is helping others win too. Even if it means slowing down and changing our course now and then.


Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius - what a name - was the last of the great Roman philosophers and the first of the scholastics of the Middle Ages. Fifteen hundred years ago, Boethius wrote this sentence, "O happy race of mortals, if your hearts are ruled as is the universe by love." I was once invited to sit in on a master class of six young cellists from the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony. The master teacher was Yo-Yo Ma. Now, Yo-Yo is the most other-oriented genius I've ever known. His music comes from a very deep place within his being. And during that master class, Yo-Yo gently led those young cellists into understandings about their instruments, their music, and their selves, which some of them told me later, they'd carry with them forever.


I can still see the face of one young man who had just finished playing a movement of Brahms' cello sonata, when Yo-Yo said, "Nobody else can make the sound you make." Of course, he meant that as a compliment to the young man. Nevertheless, he meant that also for everyone in the class. Nobody else can make the sound you make. Nobody else can choose to make that particular sound in that particular way.


I'm very much interested in choices and what it is and who it is that enable us human beings to make the choices we make all through our lives. What choices lead to ethnic cleansing? What choices lead to healing? What choices lead to the destruction of the environment? The erosion of the Sabbath? Suicide bombings or teenagers shooting teachers? What choices encourage heroism in the midst of chaos?


I have a lot of framed things in my office which people have given to me through the years and on my walls are Greek, and Hebrew, and Russian, and Chinese, and beside my chair is a French sentence from Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince. It reads, "L'essential…l'invisibles pour les yeux." What is essential is invisible to the eye.


Well, what is essential about you? And who are those who have helped you become the person that you are? Anyone who has ever graduated from a college, anyone who has ever been able to sustain a good work, has had at least one person and often many who have believed in him or her. We just don't get to be competent human beings without a lot of different investments from others.


I'd like to give you all an invisible gift. A gift of a silent minute to think about those who have helped you become who you are today. Some of them may be here right now. Some may be far away. Some, like my astronomy professor, may even be in Heaven. But wherever they are, if they've loved you and encouraged you and wanted what was best in life for you, they're right inside yourself. And I feel that you deserve quiet time on this special occasion to devote some thought to them. So let's just take a minute in honor of those who have cared about us all along the way. One silent minute. 
Whomever you've been thinking about, imagine how grateful they must be that during your silent times you remember how important they are to you. It's not the honors and the prizes and the fancy outsides of life which ultimately nourish our souls. It's the knowing that we can be trusted, that we never have to fear the truth, that the bedrock of our lives from which we make our choices is very good stuff.


There's a neighborhood song that is meant for the child in each of us and I'd like to give you the words of that song right now.


"It's you I like.
It's not the things you wear.
It's not the way you do your hair
But it's you I like.
The way you are right now
The way down deep inside you.
Not the things that hide you.
Not your caps and gowns,
They're just beside you.
But it's you I like.
Every part of you.
Your skin, your eyes, your feelings
Whether old or new.
I hope that you remember
Even when you're feeling blue.
That it's you I like,
It's you, yourself
It's you.
It's you I like."


And what that ultimately means, of course, is that you don't ever have to do anything sensational for people to love you. When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed. 

So in all that you do, in all of your life, I wish you the strength and the grace to make those choices which will allow you and your neighbor to become the best of whoever you are.


Congratulations to you all.

Thank you, Dean Jain, for that kind introduction and let me commend you on your first anniversary as Dean of Kellogg. By all accounts, you are doing an extraordinary job.

Members of the administration, faculty, parents, families and guests: Good afternoon!

And members of the class of 2002: Congratulations!

I’m delighted to be with you today. While I have no association whatsoever with Kellogg – apart from eating the cereal – I was gratified to learn that I had been chosen by popular student vote as your commencement speaker.

I’m told it was down to me or Ozzie Osbourne. Personally, I think you made the right choice. There is far less bleeping language when I speak. And besides, I own MTV.

I’ve attended enough of these ceremonies to know that commencement speakers are always scheduled relatively early in the line-up. There's a reason for that.

It's what Mark Twain called the "live frog" principle.

Twain used to argue, and quite convincingly, that one should swallow a live frog at the beginning of every day.

That way you'd know the worst part of your day was behind you.

Well, I may not be the worst part of your day, but I am the part of the day standing between you and that emancipation proclamation known as a diploma.

And I know that its allure is perhaps — just perhaps – greater than my own.

That said, I do have a mission to accomplish here. It is up to me to utter those words of profound wisdom and inspiration ... That your mother will remember ten years from now.

I’ve never been one to pull punches, so I’m not going to stand up here and recycle all those commencement cliches: “life is a journey”… “hold fast to your dreams”… and “remember the golden rule.”

Though I’m a natural born optimist... [I learned long ago that optimism is the only philosophy compatible with a sane existence], I’m also a realist…

So… here’s the reality: you guys picked one hell of a time to graduate from business school. Am I right?

Let’s review: In the two years since you took out those loans to come to Kellogg:

Billions of dot.com dollars have disappeared. The economy has slipped in and now out of a recession. And our national security has been violated. 2.2 million U.S. employees have lost their jobs in just the past 18 months.

Since September 11th, 65,000 pink slips have been issued on Wall Street. This is no laughing matter. The job market you face is not just bleak… it’s a cold shower.

You’ve got to be wondering, “Did I make a huge mistake?”

If you came here thinking the Kellogg School of Management would guarantee you a job at McKinsey or Goldman Sachs or Kleiner Perkins upon graduation… then the answer is likely, “yes.”

There are no such guarantees. An MBA does not confer superpowers. It is not the key to the front door of paradise [not that McKinsey is paradise].

Your education … any educational experience … is a tool kit, an extremely valuable tool kit, that will help you succeed in whatever career you pursue. But you have to do the pursuing. A career is not going to chase you down…

… At least not anymore.

So, getting back to my previous question: did you make a huge mistake? Let me offer an answer that might surprise you – you made the best decision you may ever make. And, furthermore, your timing could not have been better.

As members of the class of 2002, you have had to work a lot harder to get a foot in the door at the company of your choice. And once inside, you’ve learned that you can’t pitch pedigree… you have to pitch you.

You have to sell all the skills and attributes and experiences that have brought you to this place … one of the most compelling of which is your Kellogg degree… no question.

But will it pay for itself within a year of graduating? No. Within two years? Probably not. Within five years? Maybe… maybe not.

But is that what really matters?

For years, hoards of business school graduates have flocked to management consulting and Wall Street and, more recently, Silicon Valley. Some have been motivated by a genuine passion. Most were lured, however, by the promise of instant wealth.

You in the class of 2002 have the opportunity to reassess your futures … to ask hard questions with no easy answers. Maybe your next steps don’t have to revolve around quick ways to pay off your school loans. Maybe, just maybe, this economic downturn and the events of September 11th have given you the opportunity to look harder at where you go from here … and why.

For those who chart the landmark roads to success, there is no textbook ... There is no template ... There is no track record to draw upon. Just tools ... The tools you may have picked up here and elsewhere along your life's journey... Along with a brash, unshakable faith in your own convictions and unequivocal confidence in yourself – despite what may be overwhelming adversity and a deafening chorus of criticism.

But that, to my mind, is where the greatest successes of one's life are charted ... Where fortunes are won and lost... Where characters are forged. If you never venture beyond what you know... You've spawned your own limitations. You've erected the walls of your own private prison cell.

Now, let me guess, you are all sitting there thinking you should have voted for the live frog.

But, you and I have much more in common than you realize. When I first entered the workforce … not too long ago … there was a different kind of debt to pay.

I left Harvard early in my junior year to serve my country. It was January of 1943, the world was at war … there was rationing … and the only global opportunities in our future involved armed conflict rather than economic competition. I was asked by Professor Edwin Reischauer to serve in a special cryptography unit being set up under his command in Washington D.C. our assignment: to break the Japanese code. [not something really hard … like a new business plan for Arthur Anderson].

While in the military I attended law school, first at Georgetown and then at Harvard.

When I graduated, despite offers in private practice I chose the path of least remuneration and went to work in government – in the justice system … first as a clerk for a federal judge and then as a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States.

It wasn’t until 1954 – 12 years after leaving college – that I embarked on my career in the media business … and, guess what, I took a mammoth pay cut to join my father and brother in running a struggling chain of movie theaters in the northeast. My initial annual salary was $5,000, 1/20th of what I had been making in the law by then.

I spent the next 33 years building national amusements from a 12 theater chain into a global leader in motion picture exhibition. During that time, I gained the experience, credibility and industry knowledge to launch a bid in 1987 for a company many times the size of my own. That company was Viacom … and you know the rest. What you may not know is that I was 64 when I acquired Viacom.

So, those of you lamenting your ill fortunes at the age of 28 would do well to heed the following three pieces of advice from someone who has never lamented one moment of a career that has spanned five decades:

1. Opportunity never knocks. 2. Follow your heart, but stick to what you know. 3. It’s not about the money – it’s about winning.

First, opportunity never knocks. I don’t know who came up with the inane expression. In fact, if anything, opportunity always plays hard to get.

Do you think that Viacom came looking for me? Or Paramount? Nothing could be farther from the truth.

Let me tell you a little story to illustrate how far you have to go for something to fall in your lap. In 1987 when I challenged management for control of Viacom, I was embarking on a battle, the epic proportions of which I could not have imagined. At the time, Viacom was a small but promising company with a diversified portfolio of entertainment assets, but it was Viacom’s cable networks – specifically MTV, Nickelodeon and Showtime – that caught my eye. I was convinced that cable and, specifically, cable programming was a business with a bright future and I wanted to be part of it.

Still, I had no interest in running the company… that is, until an investment group led by the company’s CEO made an offer to take it private. At the price they were proposing to pay, the company was a steal. And, as one of the company’s larger shareholders, they were stealing it from me.

This “theft” provoked two reactions. It increased my interest in Viacom, and it stimulated my competitive juices. The odds were stacked against us. The board was in management’s back pocket. Information was kept from us. The company piled on defensive baggage… poison pills, golden parachutes, you name it.

More than once, I had the opportunity to exit the fray with a tidy profit… but the more I learned about Viacom, the greater my conviction that I would own this company.

Remember, true opportunity never knocks. I have found that I have to go looking for opportunity – and if I don’t find it, I have to create it.

Some six years later when I looked out over the horizon and saw Paramount, that same sense of absolute conviction returned. Paramount was a perfect fit. It was a gourmet media meal. We simply had to have Paramount. And 18 brutal months and 2 billion dollars later, we had it.

There’s an aphorism: "the older you get, the easier it is to resist temptation, and the harder it is to find it."

Well, I couldn't disagree more.

In fact, I find that as I grow older, temptation comes looking for me! Temptation, but not opportunity. For a dealmaker like me, CBS was a gift. In fact, compared with the others, it was gift-wrapped.

But the point is – I went after it … I trusted my gut … and I did the deal. And I’m infinitely glad I did. Viacom today is a global leader in every facet of the media and entertainment industry and is the #1 outlet on the planet for connecting advertisers with the audiences they need to reach. And as a result of the relative performance of Viacom as against the other media companies in the media world, Viacom has now and recently become the number one media company in the world.

Carpe diem, my friends …because life rarely presents itself in neatly packaged case studies.

That's why I would argue that the most important advantage this school has provided is the ability and the tools to take a chance. You have been educated in the art of infinite possibility. You have learned that greater rewards attend to greater risk. Apply that knowledge to your life as you go forward.

Second lesson: Follow your heart; but stick to what you know.

Taking a quick look at Kellogg’s incoming classes in recent years, one cannot help but be impressed with the rich diversity of experiences and backgrounds. An Indy 500 racecar driver … a clown with Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus … an astronaut… an aquaculturist … the list goes on.

Each one of you brought an utterly unique passion for life and a rich array of skills and assets when you came here, and I hope that you have kept that portfolio current and top of mind as you crunched numbers and assessed economics over the past two years. Because I truly believe that your greatest success lies in following your heart and sticking to what you know.

Everything ... Every dime I’ve made in the forty-plus years I’ve been in the media business … I plowed right back into the media business. The acquisitions I’ve made in recent years – Viacom, Blockbuster, Paramount, CBS – are some of the biggest bets ever made in this industry.

But I’ve been investing in the motion picture industry for decades. During the years I was running National Amusements, the company took large stakes in Warner Communications, Disney, Loews and, ultimately, Fox and Columbia… and we made a lot of money. My profit on the Columbia stock alone was $26 million dollars.

Many investors are counseled to diversify. That’s probably good advice for many people. But not me.

I believe that to understand the value of a business, you must be able to anticipate success. You can’t evaluate a company based simply on the present worth of its assets and operations. You need to understand the growth dynamic, the potential and your own participation in realizing it. You have to be fully confident that if its value is ten, you can make it twenty. If you ever question that confidence, you’ve already lost.

While I always inform my opinions with comprehensive due diligence, I take action based on gut instinct. Instinct, as I define it, is a combination of experience and the intellectual capacity to come up with the right answer to a question, the right solution to a problem.

I have that instinct when it comes to media and entertainment, because I know that business. And I stick to what I know.

My final piece of wisdom: It’s not about the money…. It’s about living and winning.

I don’t splurge on much in my life. My material desires have always been minimal. Born to the children of Jewish immigrants, I spent my early years in a tenement called Charlesbank homes in Boston’s west end. Our apartment had no toilet; it never occurred to me that other apartments did.

My father peddled linoleum, supporting not only a wife and two kids but his own parents and my mother’s family as well. He was a hardworking, highly competent man, who steadily succeeded through life, ultimately building his own business – first nightclubs, then a small chain of drive-in movie theaters.

My mother devoted herself to the care and the education of her two sons … with an emphasis on education.

The values my parents instilled in me did not include living extravagantly and amassing great personal wealth. The truth is, I’ve never cared for money. I realize that sounds strange coming from a billionaire, and I recognize that many people do work for money, but I would wager that those who become extremely successful are more strongly motivated by the desire to achieve, by a commitment to excellence and by an obsessive drive to win. They are not primarily motivated by the lure of the dollar. That certainly describes me. I have the passion to win – in my case you can judge a book by its cover.

I put everything I had into every business battle … and I must say I relished every minute. Why? Because the assets were worth fighting for, and because I enjoy a good contest. If you get involved in a major competitive struggle and the stress that inevitably comes with it, you’d better derive some real sense of satisfaction and enjoyment from the battle as well as the ultimate victory … or you’re toast.

Anyone who has worked with me will verify that I love being in the thick of the fray. I work ‘til I drop, and I expect those by my side to do the same …

I believe in absolute and unrelenting commitment to a goal, and I’ve held this work ethic since I was a child.

As a schoolboy, I brought home top honors year after year. And that’s because I worked relentlessly … morning, noon and night.

I had no friends. I had no social life. I honestly don’t remember eating in high school. The ten cents I spent every day on the round-trip streetcar fare was a significant expense for my family. I had to justify that expense. I had to be the best. That meant no slips, no lapses, no room for error.

Over the course of my career, my colleagues and I have endured endless, mind-numbing 20-hour days of painstaking negotiation. They were brutal. And they were the best times of my life.

That’s the reward of working ‘til you drop. That’s the reward of winning.

But let me quickly draw the distinction – as Enron did not – between winning … and winning at all costs. An honest victory is the only victory in the long run, as we all intuitively know. Unfortunately, greed blinds that intuition all too often.

In all the negotiations I’ve conducted throughout my career – and there have been many – I’ve followed one preeminent principle: unless it’s a win/win, you both lose.

Well, my duty this afternoon was to provide you with some intuition as to what the journey is like from where you are to where I am, and I hope I have discharged it.

Your good fortune, class of 2002, may well be your lack of good fortune compared with previous years. You’ve had to strike forth and discover your own destinies in a difficult and hazardous world, and, in so doing, you have stepped outside yourselves into a bigger and tougher but more rewarding world. I have always believed and I have taught my children and grandchildren that great success is not built on success. It is built on failure, frustration and sometimes even calamity.

As the American writer, J.A. Holmes, once observed, "it is well to remember that the entire population of the universe, with one trifling exception, is composed of others."

We all had a powerful reminder of that truth last fall, as we came face to face with the sadistic egos of the few and the selfless heroism of the many. Last September’s tragic events powerfully readjusted our collective and individual priorities and reminded us all that our ultimate legacy is the difference we make in the lives of others.

Each of us will define that notion of “service to others” in our own unique way. For my part, I teach. Early in my career with the Department of Justice, I taught at the University of San Francisco Law School.

Later, I designed a course called "Law of the Entertainment Industry," which I taught for five hours a week for several years at the Boston University Law School. I’ve since been a regular visiting professor at Brandeis University and at Harvard Law School, and I must tell you, these have been among the most fulfilling activities of my career.

It's a learning experience as well as a teaching experience, and it has provided me with the opportunity to give something back to the academic community – a community that has given so very much to me.

I encourage all of you to explore any and all opportunities to pass along the benefits of your experience to those who will follow. This may sound like jargon, but it is not – it will add to your own self-esteem and enhance the pleasure of how you work and live.

An important part of that experience is the time you have spent here. You will find that it forms a bridge to a larger world, a bridge based on warmth, on caring, on community and, yes, on expectations. That larger world will engulf you; you can never completely escape it.

But you will find that the commitment to excellence – that passion to win – that this school has instilled in you will serve you well all the days that will follow. My early days at Boston Latin School and later at Harvard inspired in me both the ability to achieve great success and the character to withstand tremendous disappointment.

At Kellogg, you have learned to think analytically ... To organize your mind to accept and assess every possible option ... Every potential avenue. But more importantly, Kellogg has taught you to act on that knowledge, decisively and aggressively. While you arrived here knowing how to take a chance, you leave here knowing how to take the right one. Trust your gut. Be a risk taker.

I recognize that it has been a long day, so let me leave you with the following observation on life by the poet, Emily Dickinson.

She wrote, "to live is so startling, it leaves little time for anything else."

That, to me, is the definition of a life lived to the fullest, and one I strive to fulfill every day.

Life should not be a passive exercise. Rather it should be engaging ... And challenging ... And enriching.

If we waste it ... If we place limits on it... If we disregard its opportunities, then we have denied not only ourselves, but all those who could have been touched by our efforts.

I hope that you feel the same as I ... And that you greet the life and the career that await you with the same vigor that attended your studies. I commend you on your past accomplishments.

Now, at the risk of being repetitive, let me remind you – trust your instinct. Don’t be a follower. Live dangerously. If there is a choice, take a chance. And remember – in the world in which you will live, the world in which I live now, like it or not, winning is everything.

Thank you.

I am honored and surprised that you asked me to speak today.

This must be a magical day for you. I wouldn't know. I accidentally forgot to graduate from college. I meant to, 30 years ago, but things got away from me. I did graduate from high school, though -- do I get a partial credit for that? Although, unfortunately, my father had forgotten to pay the book bill, so at the graduation ceremony, when I opened the case to see my diploma, it was empty. Except for a ransom note that said, see Mrs. Foley, the bookkeeper, if you ever want to see your diploma alive again.

I went to Goucher College in Maryland for the best possible reasons -- to learn -- but then I dropped out at 19 for the best possible reasons -- to become a writer. Those of you who have read my work know that instead, I accidentally became a Kelly girl for a while. Then, In a dazzling career move, I got hired as a clerk typist in the Nuclear Quality Assurance Department at Bechtel, where I worked typing and sorting triplicate forms. I hate to complain, but it was not very stimulating work. But it paid the bills, so I could write my stories every night when I got home. I worked at Bechtel for six months -- but I had nothing to do with the current administration's shameless war profiteering. I just sorted triplicate forms. You've got to believe me. It was a terrible job, at which I did a terrible job, but it paid $600 a month, which was enough to pay my rent and bills. This is the real fly in the ointment if you are crazy enough to want to be an artist -- you have to give up your dreams of swimming pools and fish forks, and take any old job. At 20, I got hired at a magazine as an assistant editor, and I think that was the last real job I've ever had.

I bet I'm beginning to make your parents really nervous -- here I am sort of bragging about being a dropout, and unemployable, and secretly making a pitch for you to follow your creative dreams, when what they want is for you to do well in your field, make them look good, and maybe also make a tiny fortune.

But that is not your problem. Your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued. Whether you're going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over people and circumstances, or whether you are going to taste it, enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are.

At some point I finally started getting published, and experiencing a meager knock-kneed standing in the literary world, and I started to get almost everything that many of you graduates are hoping for -- except for the money.


I got a lot of things that society had promised would make me whole and fulfilled -- all the things that the culture tells you from preschool on will quiet the throbbing anxiety inside you -- stature, the respect of colleagues, maybe even a kind of low-grade fame. The culture says these things will save you, as long as you also manage to keep your weight down. But the culture lies.

Slowly, after dozens of rejection slips and failures and false starts and postponed dreams -- what Langston Hughes called dreams deferred -- I stepped onto the hallowed ground of being a published novelist, and then 15 years later, I even started to make real money.

I'd been wanting to be a successful author my whole life. But when I finally did it, I was like a greyhound catching the mechanical rabbit she'd been chasing all her life -- metal, wrapped up in cloth. It wasn't alive; it had no spirit. It was fake. Fake doesn't feed anything. Only spirit feeds spirit, in the same way only your own blood type can sustain you. It had nothing that could slake the lifelong thirst I had for a little immediacy, and connection.

So from the wise old pinnacle of my 49 years, I want to tell you that what you're looking for is already inside you. You've heard this before, but the holy thing inside you really is that which causes you to seek it. You can't buy it, lease it, rent it, date it or apply for it. The best job in the world can't give it to you. Neither can success, or fame, or financial security -- besides which, there ain't no such thing. J.D. Rockefeller was asked, "How much money is enough?" and he said, "Just a little bit more."

So it can be confusing -- most of your parents want you to do well, to be successful. They want you to be happy -- or at least happy-ish. And they want you to be nicer to them; just a little nicer -- is that so much to ask?

They want you to love, and be loved, and to find peace, and to laugh and find meaningful work. But they also -- some of them -- a few of them -- not yours -- yours are fine -- they also want you to chase the bunny for a while. To get ahead, sock some away, and then find a balance between the greyhound bunny-chase, and savoring your life.

But the thing is that you don't know if you're going to live long enough to slow down, relax, and have fun, and discover the truth of your spiritual identity. You may not be destined to live a long life; you may not have 60 more years to discover and claim your own deepest truth -- like Breaker Morant said, you have to live every day as if it's your last, because one of these days, you're bound to be right.

So I thought it might help if I just went ahead and told you what I think is the truth of your spiritual identity ...

Actually, I don't have a clue.

I do know you are not what you look like, or how much you weigh, or how you did in school, and whether you get to start a job next Monday or not. Spirit isn't what you do, it's ... well, again, I don't actually know. They probably taught this junior year at Goucher. But I know that you feel it best when you're not doing much -- when you're in nature, when you've very quiet, or, paradoxically, listening to music.

I know you can feel it and hear it in the music you love, in the bass line, in the harmonies, in the silence between notes; in Chopin and Eminem, Emmylou Harris, Bach, whoever. You can close your eyes and feel the divine spark, concentrated in you, like a little Dr. Seuss firefly. It flickers with aliveness and relief, like an American in a foreign country who suddenly hears someone speaking in English. In the Christian tradition, they say that the soul rejoices in hearing what it already knows. And so you pay attention when that Dr. Seuss creature inside you sits up and says, "Yo!"

We can see spirit made visible in people being kind to each other, especially when it's a really busy person, taking care of a needy annoying person. Or even if it's terribly important you, stopping to take care of pitiful, pathetic you. In fact, that's often when we see spirit most brightly.

It's magic to see spirit largely because it's so rare. Mostly you see the masks and the holograms that the culture presents as real. You see how you're doing in the world's eyes, or your family's, or -- worst of all -- yours, or in the eyes of people who are doing better than you -- much better than you -- or worse. But you are not your bank account, or your ambitiousness. You're not the cold clay lump with a big belly you leave behind when you die. You're not your collection of walking personality disorders. You are spirit, you are love, and, while it is increasingly hard to believe during this presidency, you are free. You're here to love, and be loved, freely. If you find out next week that you are terminally ill -- and we're all terminally ill on this bus -- all that will matter is memories of beauty, that people loved you, and you loved them, and that you tried to help the poor and innocent.

So how do we feed and nourish our spirit, and the spirit of others?

First, find a path, and a little light to see by. Every single spiritual tradition says the same three things: 1) Live in the now, as often as you can, a breath here, a moment there. 2) You reap exactly what you sow. 3) You must take care of the poor, or you are so doomed that we can't help you.

You don't have to go overseas. There are people right here who are poor in spirit; worried, depressed, dancing as fast as they can, whose kids are sick, or whose retirement savings are gone. There is great loneliness among us, life-threatening loneliness. People have given up on peace, on equality. They've even given up on the Democratic Party, which I haven't, not by a long shot. You do what you can, what good people have always done: You bring thirsty people water; you share your food, you try to help the homeless find shelter, you stand up for the underdog.

Anything that can help you get your sense of humor back feeds the spirit, too. In the Bill Murray army movie "Stripes," a very tense recruit announces during his platoon's introductions, "My name is Francis. No one calls me Francis. Anyone calls me Francis, I'll kill them. And I don't like to be touched -- anyone tries to touch me, I'll kill them." And the sergeant responds, "Oh, lighten up, Francis." So you may need to upgrade your friends. You need to find people who laugh gently at themselves, who remind you gently to lighten up.

Rest and laughter are the most spiritual and subversive acts of all. Laugh, rest, slow down. Some of you start jobs Monday; some of you desperately wish you did -- some of your parents are asthmatic with anxiety that you don't. They shared this with me before the ceremony began.

But again, this is not your problem. If your family is hell-bent on you making a name for yourself in the field of, say, molecular cell biology, then maybe when you're giving them a final tour of campus, you can show them to the admissions office. I doubt very seriously that they could even get into U.C. Berkeley -- I talked to a professor who said there is not a chance he could get in these days.

So I would recommend that you all just take a long deep breath, and stop. Just be where your butts are, and breathe. Take some time. You are graduating today. Refuse to cooperate with anyone who is trying to shame you into hopping right back up onto the rat exercise wheel.

Rest, but pay attention. Refuse to cooperate with anyone who is stealing your freedom, your personal and civil liberties, and then smirking about it. I'm not going to name names. Just send money to the ACLU whenever you can.

But slow down if you can. Better yet, lie down.

In my 20s I devised a school of relaxation that has unfortunately fallen out of favor in the ensuing years -- it was called Prone Yoga. You just lie around as much as possible. You could read, listen to music, you could space out, or sleep. But you had to be lying down. Maintaining the prone.

You've graduated. You have nothing left to prove, and besides, it's a fool's game. If you agree to play, you've already lost. It's Charlie Brown and Lucy, with the football. If you keep getting back on the field, they win. There are so many great things to do right now. Write. Sing. Rest. Eat cherries. Register voters. And -- oh my God -- I nearly forgot the most important thing: refuse to wear uncomfortable pants, even if they make you look really thin. Promise me you'll never wear pants that bind or tug or hurt, pants that have an opinion about how much you've just eaten. The pants may be lying! There is way too much lying and scolding going on politically right now without your pants getting in on the act, too.

So bless you. You've done an amazing thing. And you are loved; you are capable of lives of great joy and meaning. It's what you are made of. And it's what you're for. So take care of yourselves; take care of each other. Thank you.

As many of you know, last summer there was a lot of publicity about my health.  It turned out that I had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and it was a high grade cancer.  I had gotten an MRI and had demonstrated some abnormalities as well.  We initially tried to keep that relatively quiet, but within 24 hours there had been announcements on the radio that I had brain cancer, that I had pancreatic cancer, that I had colon cancer, that I had bone cancer, I was dying, I had died already, so one lady called the office and said, “I heard Dr. Carlson is dead, I want to talk to him.”  It became apparent that we were going to have to go public with that information.  I must say that I was just so struck by the outpouring of affection from all over the world.  So many people were praying.  I had 10 bags of cards and letters from everybody, from janitors to President and Mrs. Bush, who said that they were praying for me.  I think the Lord just got tired of hearing about me, so he said, “All right,” so I would let everybody know that I am completely healed now and there’s no problem.  Now medicine has been the only thing that really has been of any interest to me as a youngster.  I remember listening to the mission stories at church and Sunday school, and they frequently featured missionary doctors who seemed to me like the most noble people on the face of the earth.  You know, they would travel at great personal expense to all parts of the world to bring not only physical, but mental and spiritual healing, to people.  And they seemed like the most noble people in the world, and I said, “That’s what I’m going to be.”   

That was my dream from the time I was eight until I was 13, at which time, having grown up in dire poverty, I decided I’d rather be rich.  So missionary doctor was out and psychiatrist was in.  I didn’t know any psychiatrists, but they seemed like very rich people on TV.  They lived in fancy mansions and drove jaguars, had these big plush offices, and all they had to do was talk to crazy people all day.  And I figured I was doing that anyways so I said, “This is going to work out extremely well.  So I started reading Psychology Today, I majored in psychology in college, did advanced psych in medical school and I was all set, until I started meeting a bunch of psychologists.  Need I say more about that.  Actually some of my best friends are psychologists.  But I discovered that what psychologists do in real life and what they do on TV are two very different things.  And what they do in real life is considerably more important than what they do on television.  They’re some of the more intellectual individuals in the medical community.  But it wasn’t where my talents were located.  

I analyzed my gifts and talents, because I believe that God gives everybody specific gifts and talents.  I realized I had a tremendous amount of eye-hand coordination, the ability to think in 3-dimensions, was a very careful person, never knocked things over and said oops, which would not be a good thing for a neurosurgeon, let me tell you.  When I put all of that together with my interest in the mind, I decided that neurosurgery was the best thing for me.  Later on I decided that pediatric neurosurgery was even better because with the older people I found that they never seem to get better; like if they had back pain, until they got their settlement, so I didn’t really want to deal with that.  And also with the kids, what you see is what you get.  And also I love to get a big return on my of psychologists.  Need I say more about that.  Actually some of my best friends are psychologists.  But I discovered that what psychologists do in real life and what they do on TV are two very different things.  And what they do in real life is considerably more important than what they do on television.  They’re some of the more intellectual individuals in the medical community.

And also with the kids, what you see is what you get.  And also I love to get a big return on my investment.  With an old geezer, you can spend all these hours operating, and you can do a great job, and they die in three years from something else; whereas with a kid, you spend all that time and you may get 40, 50, 60 years.  I like a big return on my investment, that’s why I concentrate on young people.  

There were some bumps along the way.  When my parents got divorced, obviously that was a big bump.  My mother was one of 24 children, and she was married at age 13, and she and my father moved from rural Tennessee to Detroit, where he was a factory worker.  She discovered he was a bigamist and had another family.  

I told that story at a graduation at the University of Utah and nobody thought it was that strange.  But obviously she thought that that was pretty strange.  Of course they don’t do that in Utah anymore.  I think we all understand that.  In fact some of the most upstanding people I’ve ever met are from Utah, with very strong set of morals and values.  And we’ve had wonderful vacations in Utah.  First of all, recognize that there are no black people in Utah.  I remember we were on vacation there once and I took my boys to a game arcade.  The manager was so happy he came out with two hands full of tokens and said “You guys have a great time.” So there are some advantages to being black in Utah.  

But at any rate, my mother was devastated when she found that out, and we moved to Boston to live with her older sister and brother-in-law, in a typical tenement with all the disadvantages that one might anticipate in such an environment.  I remember in particular the violence.  Both of my cousins were killed.  It was just such a violent place.  I never anticipated that I would live beyond 25 years.  And then there was so much poverty.  There was never money for anything.  But I actually think that perhaps that poverty was a good thing in the long run because it puts fire in your belly.  And there’s nothing wrong with hardship.  Some people like to use that as an excuse.  But I tell my young children, actually they’re not all that young, they’re all teenagers, that they are much more disadvantaged than I was, because they’ve traveled all over the world, they’ve met everybody, they’ve done everything, they’ve never known any want.  And I don’t think they have the same kind of fire in their belly.  So my wife and I try to create artificial difficulties for them, try to help them out a little bit.  I really think that it is a wonderful thing.  

I think back to when I was a first year medical student at the University of Michigan.  I didn’t do that well on the first set of comprehensives, in fact I did terribly.  I was sent to see my counselor, and he looked at my record and he said, “You seem like a very intelligent young man.  I bet there are a lot of things you could do, outside of medicine.”   And he encouraged me to drop out of medical school.  He said that I was just torturing myself and everyone else and that I would be much happier if I dropped out.  I told him that medicine was the only thing that I ever wanted to do.  I couldn’t even consider it.  He said, “Then let’s put you on a reduced schedule.  You’ll take half the first-year courses the first year, half the first year-courses the second year, half the second-year courses the third year, we’ll just keep dividing things and eventually you will graduate, or you’ll die.    I wasn’t particularly interested in that either, so I just thanked him for his advice and I went home and I started contemplating, and I said, “You know you’re not stupid.”  

I thought back to when I was a youngster in grade school.  My nickname was dummy.  That’s what everybody called me, and I really didn’t think that I was very smart, and I didn’t really try very hard because I didn’t think that I could learn.  

Fortunately my mother, who worked as domestic, cleaning people’s houses, two and three jobs at a time, felt differently than everyone else.  She felt that I could do it, and my brother also.  But she didn’t know what to do to get us to understand that.  She prayed and she asked God to give her the wisdom to know what to do to get her young sons to know the importance of intellectual development.  And God gave her the wisdom, at least in her opinion.  My brother and I didn’t think it was all that wise.  I mean, turning off the TV, what kind of wisdom is that.  As far as we were concerned, that was child abuse.  But she said that we could watch two or three TV programs during the week, and with all that spare time, we had to read two books apiece from the Detroit public library and submit to her written book reports, which she couldn’t read, but we didn’t know that.  She’d put a little check mark on it and act like she was reading it.  I was not at all pleased about this, as you might imagine.  My friends were out there having a good time and here I was in the house reading books.  

But, you know, something interesting happened.  I discovered that between the covers of those books, despite the poverty, I could go any place in the world.  I could be anybody.  I could do anything.  I began to open up incredible new horizons.  I began to visualize myself in a laboratory pouring chemicals from a beaker into a flask, chemical reactions occurring, completing electrical circuits, and discovering microcosms in a microscope and galaxies in a telescope.  I began to know things that no one else in my class knew.  And within the space of a year and a half, I went from the bottom of the class to the top of the class, much to the consternation of all of those students who used to laugh and call me dummy.  The same ones would come to me in the seventh grade who used to call me dummy in the fifth grade, and they would say, “Benny, Benny, how do you work this problem?”  And I would say, “Sit at my feet, youngster, while I instruct you.”  I was perhaps a little obnoxious, but it sure did feel good to say that to those turkeys.  

But you know, the key thing there was that when I was in the fifth grade, I thought I was stupid, so I conducted myself like a stupid person, and I achieved like a stupid person.  When I was in the seventh grade, I thought I was smart, so I conducted myself like a smart person, and achieved like a smart person.  What does that say about expectations?  But also, the whole concept of positive versus negative reinforcement, suppose that guy in medical school had been trying to find ways to be positive rather than negative, how many people had he discouraged along the way.  And all of that came flooding back to me, and I started thinking about my classes in medical school and I said, “You know, what kind of classes have you always done well in and what kind of classes not as well in.”  And I concluded that I always did well in classes where I did a lot of reading and not so well in classes where I listened to a lot of boring lectures.  And there I was listening to a lot of boring lectures everyday, so I made an executive decision to skip those lectures and spend that time reading, and the rest of medical school was a snap.  

I enjoyed telling that story when I went back to my medical school as a commencement speaker some years later and I was looking for that guy who had told me to drop out.  But you know, the fact of the matter is, we all have a tremendous sphere of influence.  Graduates, as you go forth into the world, you will have a great sphere of influence, and you can choose to be an encourager or a discourager.  You can be a mentor or you can be somebody who sets a bad example, and the ripple effect will be tremendous.  It’s always much greater than anything that you could imagine.  

But going back to when I was in grade school and not doing so well, I’m reminded of many students that I encounter today.  I have a program at the hospital where I bring in 800 students at a time, and I show them slides of the human brain and the various kinds of things that go on in a research institution.  At the end, I allow them to ask me questions, but sometimes I ask them questions.  And I asked the question not to long ago, “How many of you can name me five NBA players?”  Do you know that virtually every hand went up, even the girls; everybody can name five NBA players?  Then I said, “What about five major baseball players?”  No problem, NFL, piece of cake, rap singers, movie stars, they knew them all.  I said, “Who can name for me five Nobel prize winners?”  Now only ten hands out of the 800 went up.  I said, “Leave your hands up, because I’m going to call on one of you.”  All of the hands went down.  Now, what does that tell you?  And then I said, “Well, wait a minute; this is the information age, who can tell me what a microprocessor is?”  Of course, they were weary by now, so only one young man raised his hand.  I called on him and he proudly stood up and he said, “A microprocessor is a tiny processor.”  That was the extent of his knowledge, a tiny processor.  

Very, very sad commentary about what’s going on, and the reason that’s so alarming is because there was a survey done a few years ago about the ability of students in high school in this country versus all the other industrial nations.  Do you know we scraped the bottom of the barrel in the math and science areas?  That’s very concerning in the technological age.  When we were in the agricultural age, it is true that we could produce more corn and wheat and barley than anybody else.  We were mighty.  And what about in the industrial age?  Think about our industrial might.  Think about World War II, Hitler and the Axis powers, the Japanese and the others, crushing one empire after the next, falling like dominoes.  The world about to come under the rule of tyranny, except for one thing, the United States of America.  A nation with the ability to send its young men from the country and the cities, the hills and the dales, to fight a two-front war, two opposite ends of the world, a county with the ability to send its young women into the factories to build more airplanes and tanks and mortars than anybody could imagine, a country that saved the world from tyranny.  But you know what?  We’re no longer in the industrial age.  Now we’re in the information age, and unless we reverse this trend, we’ve got problems, because we are not the first pinnacle nation in the history of world.  Pinnacle nation, number one, no competition, going to be there forever.  There have been others:  ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and ancient Rome.  Where are they now?  What happened to each one of them?  The same thing.  They became enamored with sports and entertainment, lifestyles of the rich and famous, they lost their moral compass and they went right down the tubes.  

Some people say, “That can’t happen in the United States.”  Well, you know what; it’s already in the process of happening.  The question is, “Can we be the first nation in the history of the world NOT to follow that trend?  Can we stop it?  Can we learn from the past?”  Your generation will be the ones who will determine that.  Can we not go down that pathway of hypocrisy that currently characterizes our nation, where we talk about how important education is … education, education, education, we say, particularly around a political election?  But don’t let the football stadium or the baseball stadium be 15 or 20 years old.  We’ll be ready to blow it up and build a new one for a billion dollars.  But the school can be falling apart, the windows are broken and the books have no covers, and nobody cares.  That’s the nation in which we now live.  We’ve got to find a way to change that.  

We live in a nation where people can’t talk about what they believe in anymore.  The ancient Greeks and the Romans did the same thing.  Their philosophers started philosophizing about everything.  All of a sudden there was no right, there was no wrong, it was all relative.  They could explain away anything.  Does that sound in any way familiar to you today?  Today we call it political correctness, and it’s a problem.  We’ve gotten to a place where people say, “Don’t talk about God in public, because some people don’t believe in God, and that’s offensive to them.  And don’t dare mention Jesus Christ in public, because some people might be Jewish or Buddhist or they might be Muslim, and you would offend them by saying something like that.  Let me tell you something.  It doesn’t offend me if a Buddhist comes up to me and starts talking about Buddha, in fact I am delighted that he believes in something that might improve the human relationship between us.  And what we need to begin to emphasize is not unanimity of thought, but learning how to respect and accept what other people believe, in a cordial way.  Where would we be then?  I truly believe that THAT was the intention if you go back and you look at our founding documents and you look at what our founding fathers were talking about.  They would have been horrified if they could see what was going on around here today.  

That’s one of the reasons that my wife and I started our scholarship program.  I would go into schools and I would see all of these trophies, all-state basketball, all-state wrestling, all-state this, all-state that, the quarterback was the big man on campus, what about the intellectual superstar?  What did they get, a pat on the head, a National Honor Society pin?  Other kids thought that they were nerds and geeks, poindexters.  And I said, “No wonder we’re scraping the bottom of the barrel in science and technology.  We’ve got to do better.”  So we started giving out scholarships, $1000 scholarships, to students starting in the fourth grade, for superior academic performance and demonstration of humanitarian qualities that they had showed that they cared about other people, and more than just the six weeks before the application process also.  And what a difference it makes.  And they can win year after year, from the fourth grade all the way up to the twelfth grade.  The money goes into a trust.  They can get a statement each year in terms of how much it is worth.  When they go to a college, they get the money.  The school gets a trophy every bit as impressive as any sports trophy you’ve ever seen, they get a medal, they go to a banquet, they get local press attention, and we put them on the same kind of a pedestal as the athletes.  And what a difference it makes.  And this year we named our one-thousandth scholar in six different states now, as we continue to move across the nation.  And if God is willing, before I die, I hope that this program will be in every state and in every school in the union, because I want every fourth and fifth grader in the United States to recognize that they can be on the same kind of a pedestal and receive the same kind of recognition for intellect and for humanity as they can for throwing a ball.  And I think that’s going to make a difference.

Well, you would have thought that that would have been it for me, that life was going to be wonderful.  But, you know, I had another problem.  I had a temper.  I was one of those people who got angry very easily, because I thought I had a lot of rights.  Do you know anybody like that?  The more rights you think you have, the more likely somebody is to infringe upon them.  So people were always infringing upon my rights.  Once somebody hit me with a rock, it didn’t hurt, I threw a large rock at his face, broke his glasses, almost put his eye out.  One time someone was trying to close my locker.  I didn’t want it closed.  I hit him in the forehead with my fist.  I still had the lock in my hand, put a three inch gash in his forehead.  My mother was trying to get me to wear something; I picked up a hammer and went to hit her in the head with it.  Fortunately my brother caught it from behind before it found its mark.  Other than that I was a pretty good kid.  But you can see how that temper could be problematic.  When I was 14 another youngster angered me.  I took a large camping knife and tried to stab him in the abdomen.  Fortunately he had a large metal belt buckle under his clothing and the knife blade broke.  He fled in terror.  I was more horrified, as I realized that I was trying to kill somebody over nothing.  
I locked myself in the bathroom and started contemplating that.  And some years ago I was in San Quentin, as a speaker, and I looked out over that hardened audience and saw all of those faces and I realized that but for the grace of God that could be me.  And, you know, but for the grace of God, it could be any of us.  Yes, you’re graduating today.  Yes, you’ve got a bright future in front of you.  But don’t ever get the big head and don’t ever think that you’re superior to anybody else, because anything can happen at any time.  And we must continue to be thankful for the opportunities that we have and to try to extend those to other people.  I think it makes a big difference.  But anyway, there I was in this bathroom, thinking about this temper, realizing that it was going to preclude any success for me, that my choices were the grave reform school or jail with a temper like that.  I didn’t like any of those options.  And I fell on my knees and I just started praying and I said, “Lord, you gotta take this away from me.”  And I picked up a Bible and I opened it to the book of Proverbs and there were all these verses in there about anger, temper.   It seemed like they were all written for me.  I started reading the book of Proverbs every day after that.  But that particular day, I stayed in that bathroom for three hours and when I came out, the temper was gone.  And I’ve never had another problem with it since that day.  

Some people say, “You’ve just learned how to cover it up.”  But I’ll tell you something, when the Lord fixes a problem, he doesn’t just do a paint job.  He fixes it from the inside and it’s wonderful.  But, I came to realize something that day.  And that is that God is more than just a nebulous figure that the preacher or the priest talks about, but is something real that you can take into your life and that can be a tremendous buckler, tremendous support for you.  My career just zoomed and all kinds of wonderful things began to happen, particularly after I realized that God was the neurosurgeon and that I was the assistant.  One thing after another, and all of a sudden, there I was, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at a very young age, with all kinds of incredible cases coming my way.  

But I want to end by talking about what success is.  It’s not big houses and cars and big bank accounts.  But in 1997 when I was asked to come to South Africa to head up a team to attempt to separate type-two vertical craniopagus twins, Siamese twins joined at the top of the head, facing in opposite directions.  I knew that would be a great medical challenge.  There had only been 13 attempts at such a thing previously, none of which had been successful.  So I was ready for that medical challenge.  But it was also going to be a great social challenge because the operation was going to be done at the Medical University of South Africa at Madinsa, the only major black teaching hospital of South Africa, always the step-child through all apartheid and the post-apartheid period.  This was going to be their opportunity to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Cape Town, Johannesburg and all those other great universities.  I wasn’t ready for all that social pressure as the leader of the team.  I said, “Lord, you gotta show me something here because better and more capable people than me have tried and have failed.”  And as I studied the various radiographs, I noticed that the common drainage system that their brains shared was a little narrower right in the middle than it was on either end.  The traditional neurological literature says you should decide which twin to give the drainage system to and divide the other one over the course of three or four operations, divided in time by several months, and that they would develop adequate collateral circulation; and you would be able to succeed in saving both.  But I felt strongly impressed that we should concentrate right on the central part of that separation.  When I explained that to the team, they said, “You’re the boss, we’ll do whatever you want to do.”  

It’s interesting how Siamese twins have become such a big part of my life.  I could tell you all kinds of stories about them.  But I will tell you that I was involved in separating Siamese twins just five weeks ago down in Florida.  But these were adult Siamese twins, one of them was Greg Kinnear and one of them was Matt Damon.  This is a new movie that’s coming out in December called “Stuck on You.”  I was called in as the surgeon to separate them.  It’s a lot easier in the movies than it is in real life.  

In July I’m supposed to go to Singapore to actually try to separate some real adult Siamese twins, if SARS is over with, so pray for me on that.  

But in this particular case in Zambia, I went to the operating room.  It was two days before New Year’s of ’98.  There was a big sign over the operating room that said, “God bless Joseph and Luca Banda.”  And they were having song service and prayer service, and I was thrilled.  I asked them to bring in a stereo system so we could play inspirational music.  Nineteen hours into the surgery, we were only three-quarters of the way finished.  The part that remained was so complex, the blood vessels were engorged, they were entangled, they were adhered.  It looked impossible.  We stopped the operation.  I said, “Let’s cover it over with skin.  We can come back in several of months.  They will have developed enough collaterals that we could cut through.”  And the doctors from South Africa and Zambia said, “I know you can do that at Johns Hopkins, but we can’t keep partially separated twins alive.  They’ll die.”  Now I really felt the weight of world on my shoulders as I went back in there with all of my fancy equipment.  I had my scalpel, my surgical loops, and a prayer on my lips, and I said, “Lord, it’s up to you.”  I started cutting between those blood vessels that were so thin that you could see the anesthetic bubbles coursing through them just daring you to make a knick in them.  To make a long story short, when I made the final cut and those twins were separated, over the stereo system came the Halleluiah chorus.  Everybody had goose bumps.  When we finished that operation, after twenty-eight hours, one of those twins popped his eyes open and reached up for the indo-trachea tube.  By the time we got to the ICU, the other one did the same thing.  Within two days they were exipated, within three days they were eating, within two weeks they were crawling around, and now they are in pre-school, perfectly normal.  

But you see, that wasn’t the success; the success was that you had to be there to witness what the reaction was of the people following that story so closely in the media.  They were literally dancing in the street.  Their level of self-esteem was through the roof.  You see, that’s what I mean when I say using your God-given talents to elevate the people around you.  

And that’s what I’m talking about when I say “Think Big.”  

The “T” is for talent, which God gave to every single person.  Not just the ability to sing and dance, although there’s nothing wrong with that, but intellectual talent.  That’s what we must emphasize if our country is going to maintain its position in the world.  
The “H” is for honesty.  Lead a clean and honest life.  If you don’t put skeletons in the closet, they won’t come back.  And if you always tell the truth, you don’t have to try to remember what you said three months ago.  

The “I” is for insight, from people and from reading good books.

The “N” is for nice, for being nice to all people.  You may have to practice CPR, but talk to people that you would normally walk right by and act like they don’t exist, because they have feelings, just for a week.  You’re going to get in your car and the parking lot is completely packed, there are no spaces, you see three people following you because they want to get your space.  When you get in the car, you’re not going to pull down the glove box and pull the mirror down.  Just get in the car and let them have it, just for a week.  Because what you’ll be doing during that week is that you’ll be thinking about other people first.  Could you imagine what our nation would be like if everybody thought about someone else first?  

The “K” is for knowledge which is the thing that makes you into a more valuable person.  Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, said, “Gold, silver and rubies are nice, but be treasured far above those other things; knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  Because if you renew with those, you can get all the gold and silver and rubies that you wanted.  More importantly, you’ll come to understand that they don’t amount to a hill of beans.  

The “B” is for books.  

The second “I” is for in-depth learning.

And the “G” is for God.  Don’t ever be ashamed to talk about God and the affects that God has had on you and in your life.  And people who say that talking about God in public violates the separation of church and state, do they have any idea what they’re talking about?  A couple of summers ago, lawyers came to me and said, “You can’t put your ‘Think Big’ logo up in the public schools because the ‘G’ stands for God, and the First Amendment says there can be no government sponsored religion.”  I said, “The First Amendment also says that there can be no government suppression of religious expression.”  So we had a rather vigorous argument, and I suggested that we resolve this at the level of the Supreme Court.  Now does that seem like a bold and reckless statement?  Well, it wasn’t, because I knew that the next week I was going to the Supreme Court to receive the Jefferson Award; so I figured I would ask while I was there.  And I did, and just as Sandra D. O’Connor said that they were all wet, that they had no idea of what they were talking about, of course you could put it up.  And, you know, people who say silly stuff like that, do they realize that our Declaration of Independence talks about serving alienable rights given to us by our creator, A.K.A. known as God, that the Pledge of Allegiance to that flag says we are one nation under God, in most court rooms in the land of the wall says “In God We Trust,” every coin in our pocket, every bill in our wallet says “In God We Trust.”  So, if it’s in our founding documents, it’s in our pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what in the world is that?  In medicine, it’s called schizenophrenia.  And doesn’t that explain a lot of what’s going on in our society today?

  And I hope, graduates, as you go out there, that you will fully grasp how important it is to not only live by Godly principles, but to advocate that we live by Godly principles, of caring about our fellow man, of loving our neighbor, of developing of God-given talents to the utmost so that we become valuable to the people around us, of having values and principles and standing for something.  And if we do that, then we truly will have “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”  Thank you.  Congratulations. 


Dean Rankin, members of the faculty, graduating students, guests and my fellow Longhorns....To those of you graduating today, I offer my congratulations for successfully completing this stage of your formal education before beginning your careers, further studies, or new life.

When Dean Rankin invited me to present the commencement address to the class of 2003 graduating from the UT College of Natural Sciences, I was speechless and overwhelmed. Why would anyone want a little, 80 year old woman, nearly blind and deaf to do that? Besides, I usually think of myself as more artist than scientist. Or am I? Then I recognized the unique opportunity presented to me by that invitation. History tells us that modern science evolved from the visual arts—from the artist trying to make paints and solvents from minerals, plants, and other natural materials at the beginning of the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci, the artist—or was he a scientist?—was the greatest genius who ever lived. His insatiable curiosity, persistence, willingness to learn from mistakes—his continual refinement of the senses, especially sight—his willingness to embrace uncertainty—his recognition of the interconnectedness of all things—these make for the balance between art and science, logic and imagination, or "whole-brain" thinking. This is why art and science go hand in hand.

Neither of my parents had attended college—few of their generation did. However, my Yankee father, Herbert Andrews, had gone to business college before coming to Texas where he became a successful banker and rancher. As a child I had unbounded curiosity and collected everything—which they encouraged. In 1940, when I was freshly graduated from boarding school, I wanted to go to THE University. They agreed but they [initially] would not permit their 16 year old daughter to go to UT-Austin—a den of iniquity—so I had to stay at home in Kingsville, Texas and attend the local college until I was old enough. [no longer—San Quentin quail] I hated every moment of it. My major [at both places] was home economics because I had always aspired to be a dress designer and that is where dress design was. The nation was still in the big Depression, consequently Daddy's condition for my going to UT was that I get a "permanent teacher's certificate" so I could support myself and/or my family. Mother just wanted me to get into a sorority and find a husband. I did both in less than four years.

Due to the transfer to UT-Austin, the required, dull education courses and the "hurry-up and finish" attitude brought on by WWII, I was not exposed to the humanities, literature, or the arts and very little fashion design—but plenty of chemistry, physics, bacteriology, dietetics, food technology, etc.—even math. It was a very technical degree with what were considered "tough courses for a girl" at a time when girls were not permitted degrees in such things as engineering or veterinary medicine, and were subjected to a quota system to get into medical school. I worked hard to get a Phi Beta Kappa key only to learn you were not eligible when you took a bachelor of science degree. Although many, including my father, made fun of home economics—now called human ecology—the required science courses gave me the foundation to pursue my future interests in marine science, botany, taxonomy. In my senior year I fell under the spell of a food technology professor, a nutritional scientist doing research for the government. She was required to teach a course and I was one of her two students. I worked with her day and night and learned how to learn. I hope you have been so fortunate.

I did not attend the graduation ceremony for my B.S., a marriage ceremony seemed more important. During the 25 years of that marriage with 21 different residences, I was not permitted a career but found satisfaction rearing my children while reestablishing my interest in the visual arts and taking courses in the marine sciences because I had fallen in love with the seashells of the Texas coast where we lived. Collecting and cataloging seashells and the study of painting in all media became my reason d'etre. I exhibited widely, had an agent, and sold most of what I painted.

After my children were no longer at home I returned to UT to study art in order to get the 24 hours of university credit necessary to teach a subject in a secondary school in Texas. I also commuted 40 miles to that hometown college I had scorned to obtain a Masters Degree so that I could write a thesis thereby learning how to put my research together. When that marriage ended, I began teaching art in a secondary school.

While continuing to teach, I put my shell book together. It was published by UT Press in 1971 under my maiden name. But my life needed a challenge, so in 1973, at age 50, I determined to get a Ph.D. in art and became a rare bird of that day—a mature woman starting graduate school. UT did not have a Ph.D. in art so I went to the University of North Texas because I could not afford to go out of state.

It was there I discovered not only the philosophers Whitehead, Kubler, and Korzybski, but also—I discovered myself. In three years I did 90 hours with a 4-plus G.P.A., revised the shell book, completed a biological survey for the U.S. Department of the Interior, taught a malacology seminar at a marine science institute in the Virgin Islands during a spring break, was a TA, and completed my dissertation, besides having a string of little old gentlemen friends for relaxation. In 1976 I attended that graduation ceremony.

Science and art kept me going. Malacologists [mollusk specialists] wondered how I could come out of nowhere and be able to identify all those shells so quickly. My highly developed visual perception from my experience in the arts enabled me to see the difference in size, shape, color, etc. between species very quickly. Once identified I insisted that my publisher—UT Press—place the picture of the shell with the categorized descriptions I had made for each specimen rather than on plates grouped in the back of the chapter or book as was the common practice then. I persisted in that demand and finally won. It was the first book ever done that way and today nearly all books identifying biological materials—plants, birds, fish—are like that. For that book I had to master photography of subjects in the 1 to 3 mm. range, too large for a microscope but too small for my macro lense because I couldn't find a photographer with the skill or patience to do it.

Da Vinci insisted on questioning conventional wisdom and stressed the importance of learning for oneself through practical experience. I love to garden and to preserve the fruits of my garden. In doing this I grew colorful peppers. Because of their great variety I call them the seashells of the plant kingdom. I wanted to know more about them, but there was little published and the genus Capsicum was very confused in the seventies. However, I did discover that even though they were the most-used spice and condiment in the world, that genus had never been illustrated. What a challenge to an artist! I picked up the glove. Which species and cultivars should I choose to draw? I had to go to the literature to determine that, but I had never had a course in botany—would I be able to read it? I drove to Austin and got the texts and workbooks for freshman botany, then set aside two hours each morning before going to teach public school to teach myself botany. It worked. But it took seven years for me to do the research, collect the seed, grow the peppers before spending a minimum of forty hours on each painting. In 1984 a book with my 32 botanical illustrations, their descriptions, and the story of that fascinating genus was published by UT Press.

For balance and creativity to emerge from uncertainty requires both science and art or what is now called "whole-brain thinking"—tying everything together. If you appreciate patterns, relationships, connections, and systems—if you seek to understand how your dreams, goals, values, and highest aspirations can be integrated into your daily life then you are already tying everything together. But, continue to ask questions about your relationship to the world—develop your visual perception—you will find that art has the power to give shape to human experience.

Again, congratulations! Congratulations on your completion of this phase of your life. Go forward and embrace the world. Aim for the stars. Even if you don't reach a particular star, you will have gotten a lot further along than if your aim was not so high and—while you are doing it remember—THE EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON YOU!


Thank you Chancellor Wiley, distinguished platform party, friends, guests and the very reason for our presence here today — the members of the class of 2003.

Before I start my remarks, I’d like everyone just to do something for me. Very simply — so everyone can kind of just get to know everyone else — on the count of three, I’d like everyone to turn around and shake the hand of the person sitting right behind you. One, two, three — right now, everybody, please do that.

So, I guess you still have a few things to learn.

My parents cried when I left for California. Not because I was leaving, but rather, I think, because they were afraid I’d be coming back. Not one teacher I ever had in grade school, high school or college would’ve believed that there was even the slightest chance that one day I would be asked to give the commencement address at a major university.

Many, given the opportunity, would’ve bet large sums of money against it, putting up their homes and children as collateral. Actually, I really like the idea of that, not because I’m vindictive — although in a few minutes I’m going to read the names of all the people in my life who never thought I would amount to anything — but because life should be unpredictable. And I’m very grateful that I never wasted any time trying to become somebody else’s image of what I should be.

So, thirty-one years ago today, I drove from Madison, Wisconsin, to Los Angeles, California. On the way, I passed Camp Randall, where my college graduation ceremony was in progress. I thought about going to the ceremony, but it meant I would’ve arrived in Hollywood one day later, and at the time I just didn’t see the point. I wanted to get there.

Gertrude Stein once said about Hollywood, “When you get there, there is no ‘there’ there.” That’s true. However, there will be a swimming pool and tennis court. In the end, though, it’s probably not enough to justify a life’s journey. Getting there, particularly in show business, is tough enough. You need a combination of talent, ambition, luck and a willingness to tell actors how beautiful they look today.

In retrospect, getting there was the easy part. Finding a “there” there is much harder. So today, before you get into your cars and race off to the rest of your lives, I want to give you some advice on how to get there. And I want to help make sure that when you get there, you find a “there” there.

To that end, I will give you my five rules to think about, quickly forget, but years from now kick yourself for not having listened to.

#1. Don’t think about your future, especially right now. You’ll miss my speech. There will be plenty of time to contemplate your future right after the ceremony, but then you’ll miss all the celebrating and adulation. So just wait until you get home and have a good think about something that will happen in the future that will make you happy.

When I graduated from college, I spent a lot of time thinking about how cool it would be to be on the Johnny Carson show. A few years later, it happened. We appeared on the “Tonight” show, Joey Bishop was the guest host. We were dreadful. For years I ran into people who would stop me and say, “Hey, I saw you on the “Tonight” show. Huh… What’s Joey Bishop like?” Eventually I got over the embarrassment, but I never got those years back — years I spent waiting for some future event to make me happy. I had tricked myself into thinking, “As soon as I get there, I’ll be OK.”

I work in a business where almost everyone is waiting for the next big thing. Sometimes it comes, and sometimes it doesn’t. But it doesn’t matter that your dream came true if you spent your whole life sleeping. So get out there and go for it, but don’t be caught waiting. It’s great to plan for your future. Just don’t live there, because really nothing ever happens in the future. Whatever happens happens now, so live your life where the action is — now. And one more thing: If you’re going to be on television, don’t call your friends and tell them to watch until after you’ve seen it.

#2: Don’t do anything that 30 years from now you’ll look back at and say, “Oh, my God, why the hell did I do that?!” I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard someone start a sentence with, “If only, when I was younger, I would have….” So I did a little informal survey for you, and I found out that, amazingly, all these people had the same regret. When they graduated from college, sadly, they bought furniture.

This probably needs a little explanation. Right at this moment in your life, you are in a unique position that you may never ever be in again. You have nothing to lose. Everything you have acquired of value is locked inside you. If you have a dream, now is the time to pursue it, before you buy furniture.

I was one of the lucky ones. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin with no employable skills, unless you count jury duty. It meant I had to start from scratch and figure out where I fit in. I didn’t have money, but I could afford to fail, and there were many failures. But I found out what I was good at. I found something I loved. And now I have furniture — lots of furniture.

#3: Mrs. Zubatsky’s law. One day when I was a kid, our house caught on fire in Milwaukee. A large section of the wood shingle roof was burning as the fire trucks pulled up. The firemen ran into the back yard with a large hose and began assembling their metal ladders and positioning them against the house.

Mrs. Zubatsky was our next door neighbor and, at the time, she was standing on her upstairs porch taking in the laundry. She watched anxiously as the firemen struggled with their ladders. Suddenly she leaned over the balcony and shouted down to the professional firefighters, “Forget the ladders! Just point the hose at the fire!” The firemen, to their credit, responded immediately. They dropped their ladders, pointed the hose at the fire and extinguished the blaze in about 40 seconds.

There are two morals to this story. One, never assume that just because it’s someone’s job, they know how to do it. And two, don’t let yourself be intimidated by professionals or their uniforms.

Growing up in Wisconsin, I never knew anyone in the movie business. I never even knew anyone who knew anyone in the movie business. That world had a mystique that made it seem unattainable to me. But, like Mrs. Zubatsky, I sat on my porch and I watched someone else do it, and I said, “I have a better idea.” And like her, I seized the moment.

If you have a better idea, if your plan makes more sense, if you have a vision, then put down your laundry and scream a little bit. Throw your hat into the ring and never let professionals or their uniforms prevent you from telling anyone where to point their hose.

#4: If you’re going to fail, fail big. If you don’t, you’re never going to make a difference. Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. Ask yourself one question: If I didn’t have to do it perfectly, what would I try? For many of you, the biggest obstacle to getting there will be a fear that you have carried with your since childhood — the fear of humiliation, of embarrassment, of ridicule. That is SO stupid! Oh … sorry. But really, you have to stop caring about that, which brings me to Travolta’s law.

My brother David and Jim Abrahams and I were having pie at Rumpelmeyer’s Coffee Shop in New York on the day after our third movie, “Top Secret,” opened. The reviews were terrible and it was bombing at the box office. We were really getting into some serious moping and self-flagellation when John Travolta walked in. We knew him from the Paramount lot and he could see right away that we were in a funk. We immediately poured out our heart to him, explaining the pain of our humiliating misfortune.

I’m not sure what we were expecting, but John just smiled and said, “Guys, the thing you have to remember is (that) nobody else is paying as much attention to your failures as you are. You’re the only ones who are obsessed with the importance of your own life. To everyone else, it’s just a blip on the radar screen, so just move on. By the way, are you going to finish that pie?”

I found that advice very liberating — that the only one who my big failure was truly big for was me. So I thanked him and told him how beautiful he looked today, and now when I fail big, I just go out and have a piece of apple pie and I move on. And I always save a little piece for John Travolta. Amazingly, more often than not he shows up to eat it.

#5: The next time you go into a restaurant, please don’t look at the waitress and say, “Can I get some ketchup?” You’re supposed to say, “May I please have some ketchup?” Sorry — that doesn’t count. Just a personal pet peeve of mine.

The real #5: Don’t overuse the word “love.” Everyone overuses the word “love.” “I love your shoes.” “I just love the new Justin Guarini CD.” “I really love those little things they put on the chicken sandwiches at Subway.” In Hollywood, they say “Love ya, babe!” So, OK, I get it. It’s just the way people talk and it’s probably harmless, but you shouldn’t forget the real thing. The real thing is great. It’s just not so easy with actual human beings, but if you work at it and you get it right, it will make you happier than anything else you do in your life.

Think of the world as a big glass of water with some salt in it. You have a choice. You can try to pick out all the salt or you can keep pouring in more water so eventually it gets less bitter. As you begin your new journey, you can try to remove everything that you find distasteful in the world, or you can just pour in more love. It’s the only thing that the more you give away, the more you have.

So take all that warm, fuzzy stuff you’ve been hiding and spread it around a little. And then judge yourself not by your accomplishments, but by the happiness of the people around you. If you do that, you can do anything, you can go anywhere, you can fail at anything, and wherever you are, you will find a “there” there, because you’ll bring it with you.

I would like to conclude with a sad, but true, story from my childhood. When I was a young boy of only 7, it was decided that I should take piano lessons. This is a true story, by the way. I swear. I studied piano for three years and learned to play one song poorly, which actually turned out to be an improvement over high school. Nobody was willing to tell me that I had no musical talent whatsoever. Finally, after three years, I was invited by my piano teacher, Mr. Dillman, to play in a recital. I was told recently that Mr. Dillman twitched visibly when my name was mentioned at his funeral.

I can’t answer for others, but I was very excited that I was at last going to play my song in front of an audience. The day of the recital arrived. That morning, I got the chicken pox and, tragically, I never got to play my song. But today I’ve taken the liberty of bringing with me a small keyboard and, with your permission, I will finally get to play my song in front of an audience. I swear to you (that) this is the song that I learned to play after three years — the only song I know how to play on the piano. I think you will see that the lesson is patience. There comes a time for everything.

Congratulations! Welcome to real life! You graduated from the University of Wisconsin! You can do anything! Thank you.

If I bear in mind the syllabus with which the class of 2003 has been engaged over the last four years, I don’t know how else to think of your invitation to deliver a commencement speech except as the proverbial praise from Caesar. I count it both as an honor and as a piece of luck because I’m always glad of the chance to try for an answer to the question, “What in God’s name are the humanities, and why are they of any use to us here in the bright blue, technological wonder of the 21st Century?”

The standard set of answers read like funeral orations-newspaper columnists mourning the death of western civilization, editors of alumni magazines likening the humanities to a suite of virgins set upon by Philistines or dogs, college deans talking about the precious ornaments of ancient art and modern literature buried in the tomb of a medieval library. The sanctimony is traditional, and invariably reminds me of a poem by Archibald MacLeish, “Freedom that was a thing to use, they’ve made a thing to save, and dug round and fenced it in, like a dead man’s grave.”

A mistake to think of the humanities as luxuries, or as a decent appearance that must be kept up, like the country club membership or the house in Palm Beach. Necessities. I can think of no other set of studies more relevant to our present circumstance. Our techologists bear comparison to the sorcerer’s apprentice, producing continuously improved means toward increasingly ill-defined ends. Unless we look to the humanities to clean up the mess, we stand a better than even chance of killing ourselves with our new toys.

In its Renaissance usages, the word humanist connotes resourcefulness, skepticism, irony, and self-reliance, “refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy.” A character played by Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart, not by Hugh Grant; more to do with the cunning of Ulysses, great-hearted and wide-wandering, than with the dithering of the cultural endowments in Washington, or with the intrigues behind the arras of the English Department at Yale. Humanism is about the passion of thought and the will to understand, about Darwin sailing for the Galapagos or Dostoevsky in trouble with the police, about Condorcet dying in a garret and hunted by agents of the guillotine, writing his outline of human progress so that he might hearten mankind by his vision of its possible perfections.

The imaginative taking of experience of the past can be put through as many paces as a well-trained circus horse, and when I’m at a loss to remember why I read Tacitus or Moilière I think of the magician Merlin in T. H. White’s Once and Future King, seated under a willow tree and presenting the young Prince Arthur with a certain cure for melancholy:

“The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then-to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never dream of regretting.” 

Among my own teachers, the one nearest in spirit to T. H. White’s Merlin turned up forty years ago under a potted palm tree in a New York City restaurant under the name of Otto Friedrich. In the heyday of what was then called “The New Journalism,” Otto was the managing editor of The Saturday Evening Post, and I was one of the magazine’s newly recruited contract writers. When I first met him in the autumn of 1962 he seemed a remote and professorial figure-tall and heavy-set but with the stooped posture of a man accustomed to bending over books, taciturn, unsentimental, and matter-of-fact, given to wearing the same rumpled suit for days on end, not yet fifty but seeming as old as Merlin’s owl. Over the course of the next five years, listening to him talk about the last months of the Roman Empire or Mozart’s attachment to the key of E flat with the same degree of certainty that he brought to a discussion of the Kennedy Administration’s geopolitical game theory, I understood that he joined a scholar’s love of learning with a journalist’s boundless curiosity. Free of cant and incapable of hypocrisy, Otto taught by example instead of by precept, patiently and with an unstinting kindness that he took a good deal of trouble to conceal behind a show of churlishness. He was as suspicious of metaphors as he was of politicians, and because he was a better writer than all but a few (a very few) of the more famous authors whose work he ushered into the light of print. I seldom quarreled with his judgment. Otto never indulged a writer with the sloppy display of adjectives that he associated with publishers’ blurbs and lipstick advertisements, and the best that could be hoped for was that the manuscript might pass inspection without attracting a scourge of marginal notes (“empty phrase,” “wrong word,” “absurdity”) that indicated not only a redrafting of the text but also the jettisoning of its presumed topic. By the time the Post ceased publication in the spring of 1969 I had come to recognize him as a man who summed up in his life and turn of mind what I take to be the meaning of the word “humanist.”

Over the course of a life that didn’t allow him much time to write, he published fourteen books, and when he died at the age of sixty-six in 1995, he had a list of twenty other books in mind, among them biographies of Richard Wagner, St. Paul, and Attila the Hun, a man whom he regarded as “much misunderstood, and far more worthy than his Roman enemy.” Otto wrote books in the way that other people wander off into forests, chasing his intellectual enthusiasms as if they were obscure butterflies or rare mushrooms-books about roses and Eduard Manet’s Olympia, extended essays about Scarlatti, the Albigensian Crusade, the siege of Monte Cassino and the fires of Auschwitz, books about Berlin in the 1920’s and Hollywood in the 1940’s, biographies of Glenn Gould and Helmuth von Moltke– An historian in the amateur tradition of Henry Adams, Bernard DeVoto and Walter Karp. Otto ignored the apparatus of academic scholarship, and approached the study of history in the same spirit that he approached Mozart’s piano concertos. “The only way to understand a Mozart concerto thoroughly,” he once said, “is to sit down at the piano and play it, which I do with his number twenty-seven, humbly, every six months or so.”

Otto was never at a loss for a story to tell, if not about drifting ships then about earthquakes, or flowering trees, or the company of the Christian miracles gathered on the island of Iona. His life was not without sorrow-two of his children born disabled, his right eye gone blind with disease, none of his books profitable enough to release him from his chores as an editor, a siege of mental illness so severe that for a year it brought him near insanity-but like the Merlin imagined by T. H. White, he found that the best thing for being sad was to learn something. Although he was well-versed in the “trembling of the anatomies”, I never once heard him complain of his misfortunes, and I suspect that he had little liking or patience for the kind of people-quite a few of them writers of large reputation-who display their afflictions as if they were made of gold lace. Otto believed that we are all caught up in the telling of stories (some more complicated and more beautiful than others, many of them incoherent, a few of them immortal), and he assumed that no matter how well or how poorly we manage the plot, we are all of us engaged in the same enterprise, all of us seeking evocations or representations of what we can recognize as appropriately human.

On the afternoon of May 24, 1995 in Saint Peter’s Church on Lexington Avenue in New York City the memorial service began with the playing of Bach’s Goldberg Variations, and as I listened to the theme presenting itself in a succession of different rhythms and voices, I thought of Otto setting the libretto of human feeling to the counterpoint of time. The music shifted to an aria from Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier, and I remembered that two years before going to Paris in the summer of 1948, Otto had traveled around Europe to pay his respects to various artists in whose work he had found inspiration. “Barging in on living monuments,” he once said, “a tourist collecting a generation.” At Rappallo in the north of Italy Otto invited himself to tea with Sir Max and Lady Beerbohm; in Rome he found George Santayana, reclining in striped pajamas on his bed at the Convent of the Blue Nuns. In Munich he briefly took piano lessons with Georg Pembauer, who was said to have been a pupil of Liszt, and on the terrace of the Grand Hotel in Lausanne, he accosted Richard Strauss, by then a bent and white-haired man of eighty-two, with the first pages of a piano concerto he had begun to write on the voyage from New York. The elderly lady accompanying the composer on his afternoon walk angrily waved Otto out of sight, never guessing what it was that Otto had come to say or that forty-nine years later, on Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street, the music of Der Rosenkavalier would oversee the departure of Otto’s civilizing spirit.

Within the profession of journalism I often have heard it said that the truth shall make men free, but it was Otto who taught me what the phrase means. The truth isn’t about the acquisition of doctrine or the assimilation of statistics, not even about the chicanery in Washington or the scandal in Santa Monica. It’s about the courage to trust one’s own thought and observation, to possess one’s own history, speak in one’s own voice. Most of Otto’s books never sold more than a few thousand copies, but although he knew that the reading and writing of history settles nothing (neither the grocer’s bill, the argument in the faculty lounge, nor next year’s election), he also knew that the study of history is the proof of our kinship with a larger whole and a wider self, with those who have gone before and those who will come after, and that we have nothing else with which to build the future except the wreckage of the past. Time destroys all things, but from the ruin of families and empires we preserve what we find useful or beautiful or true, on our way to death we make of what we have found the hope of our immortality.

Stories move from truth to facts, not the other way around, but in the attempt to convey the essence of a thing the teller of tales must give it a name, an age and an address, and when I see the world devastated by evil lunatics, I think of Otto Friedrich, sick or in pain, blind in one eye, playing Bach’s Partita in C Minor on a winter night on a piano badly out of tune, planning his next raid on the kingdom of the past, wondering how he might hearten himself and his fellow men with a story not yet told.

Most of what I know about the composition of English prose I learned from Otto Friedrich, who also gave me to understand that very few of the world’s powers can do you irreparable harm if you don’t make the mistake of running a con-game on the unique character and specific temper of your own mind, and that most of the political arguments going forward in the world at the present moment are the same ones that enlivened the scaffolds of Renaissance Italy annals of Imperial Rome-the old and bitter quarrel between time past and time future, between the inertia of things as they are and the energy inherent in the hope of things as they might become.

The former and more portly faction invariably commands the popular majority. It is the party of military parades and “Late Night with David Letterman”, of Time magazine, Steven Spielberg movies, and the oil company lobbyists working the halls of Congress. All of you belong, by definition if not by choice, to the party of things-as-they-might-become. Don’t underestimate the guile of your enemies. The servants of the status quo like to say that nothing is seriously amiss, that this is the best of all possible worlds, that the wisdom in office, whether at the White House or on the set of “Nightline”, brooks neither impertinence nor contradiction.

The authorities rest the case for their assurance on two lines of false reasoning. First, that the future is so dangerous that only football captains need apply, that everything is very difficult, very complicated and very far beyond the grasp of mere mortals who never have sailed up the Nile with Henry Kissinger. Second, that because this is the best of all possible worlds, nothing important remains to be said or discovered. The media have a hand in both of these deceptions, and I speak from some experience when I say that the fear of the future sells newspapers and bids up the market for cheap miracles and expensive cosmetics. The enormous acquisitions and disseminations of knowledge over the past twenty years (about nuclear physics, cancer cells, the history of Germany, terrorism, and the chemistry of bats) have brought forth corresponding gains in the levels of anxiety. Hardly a day passes without somebody naming yet another substance (previously thought to be harmless) that can kill or maim everybody in downtown Los Angeles. The evil omens decorate the seven-o’clock news, and every self-respecting newsletter announces the depletion of the reserves of deutschemarks, sunlight and conscience. The seers who look into the abyss of the millennium predict catastrophes appropriate to the fears of the audiences they have been paid to alarm. During the span of a single week at Harper’s Magazine I once received the galley-proofs of three new books entitled, in order of their arrival, “The End of Nature,” “The End of Science” and “The End of History.”

The rumors are as exaggerated as the ones about Saddam Hussein’s inventory of nuclear weapons. It is the business of the future to be dangerous, and most of the people who magnify its risks do so for reasons of their own. Jealous of a future apt to render them ridiculous or irrelevant, they bear comparison to the French noblewoman, a duchess in her eighties, who, on seeing the first ascent of Montgolfier’s balloon from the palace of the Tuilleries in 1783, fell back upon the cushions of her carriage and wept. “Oh yes,” she said, “Now it’s certain. One day they’ll learn how to keep people alive forever, but I shall already be dead.”

To disprove the second proposition, you have only to consult the listings in any newspaper-any week, any edition-to know that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are still at large on five continents and seven oceans. The headlines give the lie to the assertion that the servants of the status quo know why the word wags, and who or what wags it. Quite clearly, almost everything remains to be done, said or discovered; also quite clearly, the world stands in need of as much help as it can get, and if it doesn’t get that help from people like yourselves, then in whom does it place the hope of a new answer, or even better, a new question.

As a student at Yale in the 1950’s I was taught to think of the 20th Century as the miraculous and happy ending of the story of human progress; I now think of it as a still primitive beginning. From the perspective of the 30th Century, I expect the historians to look back upon the works of our modern world as if upon sand castles built by surprisingly gifted children.

When I was your age I made the mistake of imagining the future as a destination-like Paris or Baltimore or the Gobi Desert, and I thought that in the so-called real world the people who ran the place were made of Greek marble or Gothic stone. As I grew older I began to notice, first to my surprise, and then to my alarm, that the more loudly the Wizards of Oz claimed to know all the answers the less likely that they knew even a few of the questions. The walls of the establishment are made of paper, as often as not the fortress manned by soldiers already dead, propped like sandbags on the parapets of office. The party of things-as-they-are stages a great show of its magnificence in order to conceal its weakness and fear, and it makes small complaint if all the voters in California, New York and Michigan wander through their lives in a passive stupor. As a nation we now spend upwards of $500 billion a year on liquor, pornography and drugs, and the Cold War against the American intellect constitutes a more profitable business than the old arrangement with the Russians or the new arrangement with the viceroys of terrorist Jihad.

The discussions in the newspapers about the sorrows of American education assume the existence of what the editorial writers like to call “the educated citizen.” To the best of my knowledge I have never met such a person; even the idea of an educated citizen strikes me as preposterous. I can conceive of a self-educating citizen, and I have had the good fortune to meet a number of people who can be so described, none of them fool enough to proclaim themselves educated. Without exception they possess the valor of their ignorance, conceiving of education neither as a blessed state of being (comparable to membership in the Cosmos Club) nor as a material good sold in a store (even at Harvard’s rate of $34,000 per annum) but rather as a ceaseless process of learning and re-learning. Few pleasures equal the joy of the mind when it’s being put to constructive and imaginative use, and if not to people like those of you on this lawn, to whom do we turn for a new equation, a new line of economic or political theory, a new lyric and a new song?

Mark Twain referred to such people as “the makers of the earth after God,” and you are lucky enough to have inherited not only the writings of Twain but also the mechanism of democratic self-government. Democracy allies itself with change and proceeds under the assumption that nobody knows enough, that nothing is final, that the old order (whether of men and women or institutions) will be carried off-stage every twenty years. The plurality of democratic voices and forms assumes a ceaseless making and re-making-of laws and customs as well as of fortunes and matinee idols. Democratic government is a purpose held in common, and if it can be understood as a set of temporary coalitions among people of different interests, skills and generations, then everybody has need of everybody else. To the extent that a democratic society gives its citizens the chance to chase its own dreams, it gives itself the chance not only of discovering its multiple glories and triumphs, but also of surviving its multiple follies and crimes.

No matter what the season’s top billings in the American political circus, the argument between the past and future tense falls along the division between the people who would continue the democratic experiment and those who think that the experiment has gone far enough. The freedom of thought and expression presents society with the unwelcome news that it is in trouble, but because all societies, like most individuals, are always in some kind of trouble, the news doesn’t cause them to perish. They die instead from the fear of thought and the paralysis that accompanies the wish to make time stand still. Liberty has ambitious enemies, but the survival of the American democracy depends less on the size of its armies than on the capacity of its individual citizens to think for themselves. Tyranny never has much trouble drumming up the smiles of prompt agreement, but a democracy stands in need of as many questions as it can ask of its own stupidity and fear. Idealism rescues cynicism, and the continued comfort of the party of things-as-they-are depends on the doubts placed under their pillows by the party of things-as-they-might-become. The future turns out to be something that you make instead of find. It isn’t waiting for your arrival, either with an arrest warrant or a band, nor is it any further away than the next sentence, the next best guess, the next sketch for the painting of a life portrait that might become a masterpiece. The future is an empty canvas or a blank sheet of paper, and if you have the courage of your own thought and your own observation you can make of it what you will.

I want to start by congratulating the Class of 2003 on your great success!

It’s an honor for me to be here. I know that many of you, both graduates and parents, have been waiting for this day for many years. I’m very proud to have my parents with me today, who have also been waiting for many years. Mom and Dad … I have some bad news for you. I may be on the stage, but I’m still not going home with a degree.

Though I left UT prior to the achievement that you’re all celebrating, this school has been a big part of my life in many ways: as a source of guidance and counsel for a young start-up company, as a constant resource of talent and support for a growing and established business, and as the foundation for a dream that this community has helped to build. I feel a tremendous connection with this university, and that’s why I’m so honored to be with you this evening.

I’d like to share my remarks tonight in memory of Dr. George Kozmetsky—a longtime friend of Dell, the University of Texas, and the Austin community. George was a visionary leader who recognized the potential in people and helped fuel their success with his wisdom and counsel. I was fortunate to be one of those people.

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to travel a less-traditional path. But I’ve managed to cover a fair amount of territory. There may be some lessons that I’ve learned that could help you in some small measure on your road ahead.

As you stand here tonight, you are at the starting point of a wonderful journey. But it’s a journey that can only begin with your decision to embark. We are a nation of accomplishment, and this ceremony is a great testament to that. But the unspoken requirement of a commencement is that you now must commence. There are countless contributions and achievements that never occurred, all due to a failure to begin.

Early in the history of Dell, we recognized that our path to greater success led us out of Austin, out of Texas, and even out of this country. So as a three-year-old company, with just 150 employees, we opened our first international operation in the UK … to great skepticism. The only true believers were the Dell team … and of course, our customers. Since then we’ve expanded to serve customers around the world. But it all started with that first decision to embark.

And now you’ve accomplished something great and honorable and important here at UT, and it’s time for you to move on to what’s next. But you must not let anything deter you from taking those first steps. You have an abundance of opportunities before you—but don’t spend so much time trying to choose the perfect opportunity, that you miss the right opportunity. Recognize that there will be failures, and acknowledge that there will be obstacles. But you will learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others, for there is very little learning in success.

Fourteen years ago, Dell had the opportunity to learn two big lessons … the hard way. One lesson was from a failure to manage our inventory properly, and the other was from a failure to listen to our customers when it came to developing new products. But we followed the advice that Dr. Kozmetsky gave me, and we fixed our problems as fast as we found them. Today, we set the standard for managing inventory and listening and responding to customers, and we owe those strengths to a willingness to try, and to fail, and to learn.

With the understanding that you will face tough times and amazing experiences, you must also commit to the adventure. Just have faith in the skills and the knowledge you’ve been blessed with and go. Because regrets are born of paths never taken.

Then, as you start your journey, the first thing you should do is throw away that store-bought map and begin to draw your own. When Dell got started, it didn’t come with a manual on how to become number 1 in the world. We had to figure that out every step of the way. And with each new product and new market, the industry “experts” said we’d fail. Just a few short years ago, we announced plans to build powerful computers at the center of the Internet (“servers” for those of you from the engineering school.) Through the chorus of naysayers, we emerged as a world leader in servers, and we continue to gain momentum. And as always, we did it our way, with customers—not the experts—in mind.

You too have an advantage that you’re not encumbered by years of conventional thinking. You have a new and fresh perspective with which to view the world. Your time at this great university has helped sharpen your sense of discovery, and there is no better catalyst for success than curiosity.

It’s through curiosity and looking at opportunities in new ways that we’ve always mapped our path at Dell. Of course, we didn’t invent the concept of selling directly to customers, and we didn’t invent the personal computer … and we certainly didn’t invent the Internet. But there’s always an opportunity to make a difference. There is always the chance to refine something, to eliminate unnecessary steps, or to look at something in a new light. You can stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before and see a little further. And sometimes there’s an opportunity to achieve a major breakthrough with a completely new idea that re-defines the subject.

But whether it’s evolution or revolution, there’s always a better way to build a computer, or map a genome, or liberate a country, or take a basketball team to the Final Four. Just work to understand the world around you. Read books. Read websites. Read other people. Circle the pitfalls and highlight the opportunities. Then build a vision of how it could all be better and work like hell to make it happen.

As you walk the path you’ve chosen, remember that the road ahead is paved with relationships. I’ve enjoyed some great fortune, but none of it would have happened without the people who shared their wisdom, the hard work of the Dell team worldwide, and the love and support of my family and friends. Remember … there’s no such thing as a self-made success.

As Dell has grown over the years, many critics have asked me when I would finally step aside and let others run things. But the truth is, other people have been helping run things at Dell for a long time. The greatest mistake you can make is thinking you can do it all by yourself.

My most important role at Dell is growing and developing a strong team … and I give all of myself in that effort. I learned very early to surround myself with talented people who challenge convention, offer new ideas, and relentlessly drive for improvement. And to let those people thrive.

Try never to be the smartest person in the room. And if you are, I suggest you invite smarter people … or find a different room. In professional circles it’s called networking. In organizations it’s called team building. And in life it’s called family, friends, and community. We are all gifts to each other, and my own growth as a leader has shown me again and again that the most rewarding experiences come from my relationships.

And even as you keep traveling the road ahead, you must always remember where you came from. Each of us carries the dust and dreams of the places that helped shape us, and all of us can count our blessings that our path has taken us through Texas.
Finally, many times along the way you’re going to ask why. Why am I on this path? What is it all about? You’ll ask yourself those questions in 10 years and in 20 years as often as you’re asking them now. Well … I have an answer for you. It’s all about winning. That’s right, winning.

But I’m not talking about the most points, or toys, or market share. (Though I certainly like market share.) I’m talking about winning in a contest with your own potential. I’m talking about believing in yourself enough to become the best accountant, engineer, or teacher you can possibly be. I’m talking about never measuring your success based on the success of others – because you just might set the bar too low.

I was fortunate to find my passion early in life. I started as a UT biology major and soon realized that all of those stacks of computer parts in my room were trying to tell me something. (And my roommate had a few things to say as well.) So 19 years ago, when I was 19 years old, I started Dell in that dorm room right over there. And despite juggling my classes and a computer company … I just knew there had to be something easier than organic chemistry!

But many people find their passion later in life, and others never find it at all. And for some, their greatest passion is the search itself. But whether you’ve found your calling, or if you’re still searching, passion should be the fire that drives your life’s work.

The key is to listen to your heart and let it carry you in the direction of your dreams. I’ve learned that it’s possible to set your sights high and achieve your dreams and do it with integrity, character, and love. And each day that you’re moving toward your dreams without compromising who you are, you’re winning. Look around you. At a school this size, with an international reputation for greatness, you might think of yourself as just a number. However, I recommend that you choose the number 1.

I’ve talked today about a journey, one that each of us travels. Often we travel together, as all of you have during your time at UT. But in the end, it’s your journey. Your path to travel and your responsibilities along the way. You are free to choose, and you are free to succeed. It just takes hard work and a dream. Most who finally leave this great university never imagine that they’re going to change the world. Yet every one of you will. How you change the world, is all up to you to decide.

I wish you all a great adventure on the road ahead.

Thank you.

President Fainstein, Connecticut College trustees, faculty, and staff: thank you for the invitation to speak today; it’s my privilege to do so.

Fellow parents and elders of today’s graduates: as one of the troubadours of our baby boomer generation, Joni Mitchell, used to sing, ‘We’re captives on the carousel of time.’

My hope is that, as you listen to these reflections, that they’ll resonate with you and allow you to nod in recognition.

Finally, most especially, members of the Class of 2003: As you can see, I’ve lugged no weighty book of wisdom to this podium. I stand before you on your special day not with answers but with questions, and with an abridged history of my 52-year-old trial-anderror American life as student, teacher, father, and fiction writer. So make of my words what you will, and also, please note that I’ve fired up the retrorockets. Fasten your seatbelts, everyone. We’re about to blast backwards into the virtual past.

We’ll try a short trip first. Look, we’re here already; it’s February of 2003. The Bush administration is hard-selling the case for invasion, Home Depot is selling out of duct tape and plastic sheeting, and on the front lawns of many American homes ‘No War on Iraq’ signs are popping up through the snow like mutant crocuses. We’re innocent, still, of the concept of ‘embedded’ journalism and that new marketing slogan—’shock and awe’—but our initiation is upon us. Diplomacy is defunct, our leaders tell us. War is inevitable.

I’m in my office when a challenge arrives via Outlook Express. The novelist Dennis Lehane has drafted a petition to President Bush which acknowledges the tyranny of Saddam Hussein but asks that all diplomatic measures be exhausted before we risk ending the lives of innocent Iraqis and American military. Lehane invites fellow writers to sign.

Now, I want what Lehane wants, but I admit this to you, graduates: I blink. I walk around the office. Weigh the pros and cons of signing. There is, after all, the book buyer to consider; there’s product waiting in the warehouse at Amazon.com. Like it or not, we’re in an era of intolerance for dissenting opinion. The Dixie Chicks have yet to be beheaded, plucked, and rotisserie roasted, but the White House has cancelled a literary event where anti-war poets were to speak. In the wake of social satirist Bill Maher’s remarks about terrorism, the President’s press secretary has warned that we must all watch what we say and Maher has lost his television show. So maybe I shouldn’t sign that petition, I think. Still, my kids are watching me, listening to me, studying my responses to the world, and I do not want to send them the message that they can speak their minds at the dinner table but they had better shut up once they get into the school cafeteria. This, after all, is America, where patriotism speaks in many different voices and need not nod mutely like a smiling bobble head. And so, along with 150 other writers, among them Julia Alvarez, Amy Tan, Richard Russo, and Stephen King, I sign the petition. It’s published in the New York Times and the following day, another email arrives, this one from a reporter for a different national newspaper. He wants to know what makes me think novelists know anything about war — why I assume fiction writers have any of the answers. Hmm. Good question, Mr. Journalist. Please note that I’ve turned on the seatbelt sign.

We’re heading back to the year 1961.

Whether you’ve been here before or not, have a look. Dwight Eisenhower is moving out of the White House and John Kennedy’s moving in. The space race is on, our astronauts chasing Soviet cosmonauts into the heavens, while back on terra firma, Maris and Mantle are chasing the Babe’s single-season homerun record. On the small screen, a hapless man named Wilbur holds secret discourse with a talking horse named Mr. Ed, and at the movies, the Absent-Minded Professor has just invented flubber. We are still lightyears away from Eminem, and Nelly, and It’s getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes. No, no, our transistor radio is playing Dion & the Belmonts, who are warning against the feminine wiles of a girl named Runaround Sue and the Shirelles ask, demurely, that musical question on the mind of every teenage girl being driven in a Chevy Impala up to Lover’s Lane: ‘Will you still love me tomorrow?’

Yet as we climb into our cuddly feet pajamas of mid-century nostalgia, let’s not forget that this is also the year that the CIA superimposes a bull’s eye on the face of Fidel Castro, feeds fiction to the public, and sends bankrolled dissidents to the Bay of Pigs to accomplish what will be a dangerously miscalculated attempt at ‘regime change.’ Across the Atlantic, in Berlin, a 25-mile barbed wire fence is being erected to separate East from West. In response, the president pre-empts ‘Mr. Ed’ to warn Americans that the escalating crisis may result in a Soviet nuclear attack on our soil. His speech triggers a national preoccupation with homeland security and the back yard bomb shelter, that quaint concrete cousin of the plastic and duct tape shroud, becomes the trend du jour. On the civil rights front, the Freedom Riders travel by bus from Washington to New Orleans to desegregate the South. En route, they are met with bombs and beatings by men in hoods. Because racism is a legacy, not a genetic predisposition, one of these hooded bullies will, perhaps, sire a son who will sire a son who will scrawl anonymous hate graffiti on a college bulletin board in New London, Connecticut nearly forty years hence. Racists, anti-Semites, gay-bashers, Arab-trashers: no matter what the era, no matter who the target, the hate monger is cut from the same cloth of inferior weave.

But, as for me, if it’s 1961, then I am ten years old, a fifth grader living just up the road in Norwich, Connecticut. At school, I’m learning how to diagram sentences, master long division, and execute the duck-and-cover exercises which somehow will save me when the Soviets drop the bomb on the submarine base in Groton. I won’t write my first fiction for another twenty years, but the seeds of my storyteller’s life are planted this year by a scary nun named Sister Mercy.You see, my mother, who is alive again and dark-haired, insists that I attend catechism class at St. Patrick’s School each Wednesday afternoon from 3:30 to 4:30. Having already spent the day with three dozen parochial school students, Sister Mercy is not happy to see three dozen more rowdy public school students tramping in. We are equally unhappy to be there. There is acting out, screaming, rulers slapped against desktops, spitballs launched from the barrels of ballpoint pens. And as Sister patrols the aisles, one of us catechists, a wild girl named Pauline Migliaccio, goes so far as to affix a paper sign to the back of her veil. ‘Shake It, Don’t Break It,’ the sign says, and so that you might appreciate the full-fledged audacity of Pauline’s act, may I remind you that we’re still decades away from the invention of the Post-It note.

Unlike Pauline Migliaccio, I am far too timid to make trouble for Sister Mercy. My modus operandi for survival is to sit in back, say nothing, and try as best I can to blend in with the wainscoting. But on the afternoon my fate as a fiction writer is sealed, I get a strange and inexplicable urge. I want Sister to like me. Or, if she cannot like me, then at least to notice I exist. And so, at 4:30, when she intones those liberating words, ‘Class dismissed,’ my peers lurch toward the exit, and I hang back. I stand. With a wildly thumping heart, I approach Sister’s big wooden desk.

She is correcting papers and scowling--doesn’t notice at first that I stand facing her. And when she does look up, she says, ‘Yes, what is it?’

I don’t really know what it is, but she has spent a good part of the last hour talking about the Vatican. ‘Sister,’ I say. ‘My grandfather moved to America from Italy in 1890.’ True. He did. Pure, unadulterated non-fiction. But I can see from Sister’s clenched face that she is unimpressed.

My knees knock; my mind ricochets. Now, as it happens, earlier this same day, two of my public school classmates brought into class a papier-mâché volcano. They poured baking soda into the core, added vinegar, and made lava bubble up, spring forth, and dribble down the sides. And this demonstration suddenly comes to mind. ‘And, Sister — before Grandpa came over? When he was still living in Italy? This volcano erupted in his town. It was early in the morning, and he was the only one awake, and so he pounded on people’s doors and everyone escaped and so he saved a whole bunch of people’s lives.’

Sister’s facial muscles relax. She cocks her head. Her gold rim glasses glint a little from the light of the fluorescent lamp above. But I can see that my marriage of falsehood and fact has fallen just short of being enough. It’s a moment of truth. A moment suspended in time. Sister looks at me and waits. I look back at her and wait. And then, finally, I add ‘ ‘And ‘ the Pope gave him a medal.'

She nods, she smiles. She reaches into her bottom desk drawer, removes a holy picture, and presents it to me. The following Wednesday afternoon, Sister knows my name, I have preferred seating up front, and for the rest of this school year, whenever there is need for a note to travel from Sister Mercy’s room to the office, you can probably guess who is chosen to deliver it.

And so, at the tender age of ten, I learn of the rich rewards that can be yours if you take the truth and lie like hell about it. Bend it to your liking. Now, I could have become a Connecticut politician, I suppose. But no, I became, first, a teacher, and later, a fiction writer.

But what do fiction writers know, Mr. Journalist has emailed me to ask. Why should anyone listen to them? Because, says Grace Paley, ‘A writer must be truthful. A story is a big lie. And in the middle of this big lie, you’re telling the truth.’ Because, says novelist Jesamyn West, ‘Fiction reveals the truth that reality obscures.’ ‘Why shouldn’t truth be stranger than fiction?’ Mark Twain observes. ‘Fiction, after all, has to make sense.’ Fast forward. It’s 1984. Ronald Reagan, Boy George, break dancing, big hair. That new NBA rookie, Michael Jordan, seems so effortlessly airborne that it’s as if he’s affixed flubber to his sneaker bottoms. I’m thirty-three now. I’ve been both a father and a fiction writer for three years; one calling has somehow unleashed the other. You see, as I study my small son Jared and try to imagine who he will grow up to become, I begin to get these characters’ voices in my head. I write down what these figments say and start to worry about them and root for their safety as if they were real. The catch is: I can only find out what’s happening to them when their voices spill from the pointy end of my Bic pen onto the loose-leaf pages in front of me. And as I work on these stories, I defy as best I can that other voice of self-inflicted doubt, which keeps whispering, Stop kidding yourself. You’re never going to get anything published. Get real. Get up from that desk and mow the lawn.

But I’ve let the lawn grow and toiled away for three years and now, in 1984, the phone rings. It’s Lary Bloom, the editor of the Hartford Courant’s Northeast magazine. He wants to publish one of my short stories’ the one about the fat woman, Dolores. When my conversation with the editor ends, I hang up the phone and dance my wife around the kitchen. I pick up three-year-old Jared and toss him so high into the air that his head hits the ceiling. But, hey, it’s okay because it’s one of those suspended ceilings with the lightweight panels, so Jared’s head isn’t hurt; it just disappears for a second. My short story is published on Easter Sunday. I drive at dawn to the convenience store and buy three Hartford Courants. For ten minutes, I can’t bear to look. Then I do look. I sit there by myself in the strip mall parking lot and cry like an idiot. I am on my way. Zoom zoom. It’s 1999. Kosovo, the Clinton scandal, the slaughter of students at Columbine High. My fiction has been twice-touched by the magic wand of the Oprah Winfrey Book Club, and so my character Dolores has relocated from my hard drive to the best seller list. The troubled identical twins I’ve worried into existence for my second novel have followed suit and so I am preparing to take off on a cross-country book tour. 

Meanwhile, Jared has metamorphosed from that airborne three year old into a 6’2’’ high school senior, a near-man of seventeen. He helps me heft my luggage out to the driveway where a purring limousine waits. And as I’m driven away, I look through the tinted rear window at my child and, again, I am wet-eyed.I see a young man coauthored out of love — a son who, having moved recently into his adult body, is receding from me, but who I once knew better than I know myself’better than he knew himself, certainly, because he has been, and in my mind remains, that armflailing infant on the changing table and the pot-bellied toddler in training pants. As he stands there in the present moment, he cannot possibly know that he is simultaneously, for me, the boy in the bowl cut clutching He-Man and Skeletor. ‘ the Webelos scout in the untucked uniform. ‘ the catcher of polliwogs in his squishy sneakers ‘ the afternoon paperboy, the strap of his canvas bag crossing his chest like a bandolier ‘ the zookeeper of a never-ending domestic menagerie: turtles, fish, fiddler crabs, two ‘female’ gerbils’ and their five or six hundred offspring. ‘Gee,’ one of his middle school teachers had told him. ‘You like people and animals so much, you ought to be a biology teacher.’ But at seventeen, Jared doesn’t know what he wants to be, or even where he wants to go to school next year’Bates, Bowdoin, Trinity, how’s he supposed to know? Oh, and Connecticut College is on his list. He likes that cross country coach down there, that Coach Butler. And that Coach Wuyke, too. He wouldn’t mind running for those guys. But, hey, first things first. He can’t even think of what to write for his stinking college admission essay.

On my book tour, in city after city, the crowds come out. Strangers who have read my novels ask me how I knew their lives, their flaws, their family secrets. And, of course, I’ve known none of these. I’ve only gone to work each day and told the lie that I am someone other than myself: a wounded girl trying to survive rape, an Italian immigrant with an ego larger than Sicily, the frightened identical twin of a schizophrenic brother. I have, each day in solitude, shucked my own life and put on different lives so that I might move beyond the limitations of my own experience and better empathize with, better know the un-me, the other.

The novelist John Edgar Wideman has said, ‘I seek in fiction some hint that imagination can change the world, that the world is unfinished, a hint that we are not always doomed to make copies and copies and copies but possess the power to see differently and the guts and good fortune to render accessible to others some glimmer of what our own souls experience. Stories, after all, are a gift. Unless we’re willing to imagine what it might feel like inside another skin, then we are imprisoned in our own.’

By the time the limo delivers me back home again two weeks later, Jared has written his college essay. ‘Dad,’ he says, ‘can you check this for spelling?’ And God knows, he needs it checked. Seventeen years old and he’s still spelling the word ‘tomorrow’ with two m’s. But as I proofread, my attention shifts from mechanics to content. I’m surprised — I’m moved — to read that my son’s essay, too, focuses on ‘the other’: a girl on the front page of last year’s newspaper — an innocent eleven-year old Latina named Angelica who lived in our town and who loved to dance and who was stalked, raped, and murdered by a pedophile. Angelica and Jared were strangers to one another, born seven years apart. What they had in common was that each had walked the same steps of that paper route; each had played at that polliwog-filled pond where Angelica’s body was later found. In his essay, Jared describes a solitary visit to the pond, where a granite boulder has become a makeshift memorial to Angelica. He writes: The rock appeared to be alive with color, light, and movement. Pink rosary beads, purple flowers. Expired candles coat the rock with blue, green, and orange wax and, on the ground, a few flames still flicker with life. A plain white sheet of paper is scotch-taped to the rock. In bold red letters its one word sums up all my feelings: WHY?

Mr. Journalist, fiction writers have no answers, only questions, the most succinct and significant of which is: WHY?

Why, God, if You exist and are merciful, must our loved ones be claimed by cancer, addiction, AIDS, mental illness, muscular dystrophy, murder? ‘ Why, America, if justice is blind, do we imprison the descendants of slaves in such disproportionate numbers? ‘ Why must our poorest children get the poorest education and our hungriest be denied a place at the banquet table? ‘ Why, suicide bomber? Why?

Tough questions, graduates. Unanswerable, many of them, no matter what your major — no matter what your grade point average. And yet, we grope, we struggle to understand why. That struggle, I believe, is what makes us not just human but humane. And it can be a noble struggle when accompanied by a rejection of the unacceptable, unimaginative status quo and an honest effort to change things for the better. But how to improve an imperfect world, an imperfect nation, our imperfect selves? That question has occupied the minds of scholars, scientists, artists, and activists throughout time - and has sometimes – sometimes - been the pebble in the shoe that becomes the unbearable pain that motivates good minds and generous hearts to bring their gifts to the table, roll up their sleeves, and fix things. Graduates, be a part of that. Find work that adds to the world instead of depleting it. You owe that to yourselves, and to those descendants whose DNA you store inside you, and to the descendants of the un-you, the other. Here we are back at the station - back in the uneasy present. What’s that line from The Matrix? ‘Welcome to the desert of the real.’ As for the future, you’ll have to get there yourselves. But before you depart, I offer you a modest travel gift: these few things a father and fiction writer knows.

Aubrey, Vlado, Maylynn, Britt: In life, as in writing, voice is crucial. Your voice has been honed by your family, your ethnic heritage, your neighborhood, and your education. It is the music of your meaning in the world. Imitate no one. Your uniqueness — your authenticity—is your strength.

Sarah, Oslec, Miranda, John: Make yours a life story which is character-driven, not plot-driven, character being defined as the way you behave when there is no one else in the room to judge you. Don’t fear that silent room. Solitude will guide you if you remain strong of character.

Meghan, Justin, Alex, Joe: Learn to love the editing process. Listen to criticism, welcome it with gratitude and humility, but beware the false critic with a covert agenda. Make mistakes, lots of them, reworking draft after draft after draft of your continuing story. Your errors will be educational, and if your pencil outlives its eraser, then you’ll know you’re getting it right.

Clancy, Becca, Mridula, Jose: Regarding plot — the twists and turns and episodes of your life’s outline as much or as little as you like, but expect surprise. In fact, invite surprise. Each time you begin some next chapter, your composition of yourself will be at risk. But that’s okay—that’s good because you will not live fully if you never displace yourself. ‘Writing a novel is like driving a car at night,’ E.L. Doctorow once said. ‘You may be able to see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.’

And finally, Jared, a personal word to you: You have been a most enjoyable child to raise. Levelheaded, playful, kind to others, you’ve made few missteps, and no unforgivable ones, with the exception of that time you rented that white tux, tails, and top hat for your senior prom. As you prepare now to board the bus - to take the Freedom Ride down to New Orleans to teach biology in one of the most forsaken school districts in the nation - please know that your family loves you and is proud of you and the work you’ve chosen.

Keep in mind that the best teachers are the ones who love the student as much as the subject matter - the ones who stop speaking long enough to listen. Teaching will teach you, again and again, that you are the other and the other is you, despite the barriers we erect and the bombs we drop. Draw strength from the knowledge that education will break the backs of poverty, disenfranchisement, and violence; that war is never inevitable but only a terrible failure of the imagination; and that love is stronger than hatred. As it says so beautifully in Corinthians:

As a child, I saw it face to face.
Now I only know it in part
Fractions in me of faith, hope, and love
And of these three, love’s the greatest beauty

So, Jared, Vaya con Dios. Be well. Be safe. And know that, in the end, I wrote these
words not for Mr. Journalist but for you, and your classmates, and Angelica, together.

This is not the Worcester, Mass Boat Show, is it? I am sorry. I have made a terrible mistake. Ever since I left “Saturday Night Live,” I mostly do public speaking now. And I must have made an error in the little Palm Pilot. Boy. Don’t worry. I got it on me. I got the speech on me. Let’s see. Ah, yes. Here we go.

You know, when Bill Gates first called me to speak to you today, I was honored. But when he wanted me to be one of the Roxbury guys, I — Sorry, that’s Microsoft. I’m sorry about that. Star Trek Convention. No. NRA. NAACP. Dow Chemical. No. But that is a good one. That is a good speech. The University of Michigan Law. Johns Hopkins Medical School. I’m sorry. Are you sure this is not the boat show? No, I have it. I do have it on me. I do. It’s here. Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Faculty, Administrators, Friends and Family and, of course, the graduating Class of 2003, I wish to say hello and thank you for bestowing this honor upon me as your Class Day speaker. After months of secret negotiations, several hundred secret ballots, and a weekend retreat with Vice President Dick Cheney in his secret mountain bunker, a Class Day speaker was chosen, and it was me. You obviously have made a grave error. But it’s too late now. So let’s just go with it.

Today’s speech is going to be a little different, a little unorthodox. Some of you may find it to be shocking. I’m not going to stand up here and try to be funny. Because even though I am a professional comedian of the highest caliber, I’ve decided to do one thing that a lot of people are probably afraid to do, and that’s give it to you straight.

As most of you are probably aware, I didn’t graduate from Harvard. In fact, I never even got a call back from Admissions. Damn you, Harvard! Damn you! I told myself I would not get emotional today. But damn it, I’m here, and sometimes it’s just good to cry.

I’m not one of you. Okay? I can’t relate to who you are and what you’ve been through. I graduated from the University of Life. All right? I received a degree from the School of Hard Knocks. And our colors were black and blue, baby. I had office hours with the Dean of Bloody Noses. All right? I borrowed my class notes from Professor Knuckle Sandwich and his Teaching Assistant, Ms. Fat Lip Thon Nyun. That’s the kind of school I went to for real, okay?

So my gift to you, Class of 2003, is to tell you about the real world through my eyes, through my experiences. And I’m sorry, but I refuse to sugarcoat it. I ain’t gonna do it. And I probably shouldn’t use the word “ain’t” during this day in which we celebrate education. But that’s just the way I play it, Homes.

Graduates, if you will indulge me for a moment, let me paint a picture of what it’s like out there. The last four or, for some of you, five years you’ve been living in a fantasyland, running around, talking about Hemingway, or Clancy, or, I don’t know, I mean whatever you read here at Harvard. The Novelization of the Matrix, I don’t know. I don’t know what you do here.

But I do know this. You’re about to enter into a world filled with hypocrisy and doublespeak, a world in which your limo to the airport is often a half-hour late. In addition to not even being a limo at all; often times it’s a Lincoln Towncar. You’re about to enter a world where you ask your new assistant, Jamie, to bring you a tall, non-fat latte. And he comes back with a short soy cappuccino. Guess what, Jamie? You’re fired. Not too hard to get right, my friend.

A world where your acting coach, Bob Leslie-Duncan — yes, the Bob Leslie-Duncan — tells you time and time again that you will never, ever be considered as a dramatic actor because you don’t play things real, and are too over the top. Amazing! Simply amazing!

I’m sorry, graduates. But this is a world where you aren’t allowed to use your cell phone in airplanes, during live theater, at the movies, at funerals, or even during your own elective surgery. Apparently, the Berlin Wall went back up because we now live in Russia. I mean just try lighting up a cigar in a movie theater or paying for a dinner for 20 friends with an autograph. It ain’t that easy. Strong words, I know. Tough talk. But more like tough love. Because this is where my faith in you guys comes into play, Harvard University’s graduating Class of 2003, without a doubt, the finest, most talented group of sexual beings this great land has to offer.

Now I know I blew some of your minds with my depiction of what it’s really like out there. But if anyone can handle the ups and downs of this crazy blue marble we call Planet Earth, it’s you guys. As I stare out into this vast sea of shining faces, I see the best and brightest. Some of you will be captains of industry and business. Others of you will go on to great careers in medicine, law and public service. Four of you — and I’m not at liberty to say which four — will go on to magnificent careers in the porno industry. I’m not trying to be funny. That’s just a statistical fact.

One of you, specifically John Lee, will spend most of your time just hanging out in your car eating nachos. You will all come back from time to time to this beautiful campus for reunions, and ask the question, “Does anyone ever know what happened to John Lee?” At that point, he will invariably pop out from the bushes and yell, “Nachos anyone?!” At first, it will scare the crap out of you. But then you’ll share a laugh with your classmates and ultimately look forward to John jumping out of the bushes as a yearly event.

I’d like to change gears here, if I could. Talk a little bit about “Saturday Night Live.” Now, during my 18-year stint on the show, I had the chance to play or impersonate some very interesting people, none more interesting than our current President, Mr. George W. Bush. Now in some cases, you actually have contact with some of the people you play. As a byproduct of this former situation, the President and myself have become quite good friends. In fact, I might even call him a father figure of sorts, granted a dim-witted father figure who likes to take a lot of naps and start wars, but a father figure nonetheless.

When I told the President that I’d be speaking here today, he wondered if I would express some sentiments to you. And I said I’d do my best. So, if you don’t mind, I’d like to read this message from the President of the United States.

Students, Faculty, Families and Distinguished Guests, I just want to take time to congratulate you on your outstanding achievement as graduates of the Class of 2002. The great thing about being the Class of 2002 is that you can always remember what year you graduated because 2002 is a palindrome which, of course, is a word or number that is the same read backwards or forwards. I’ll bet you’re surprised I know that word, but I do. So you can suck on it.

Make no mistake, Harvard University is one of the finest in the land. And its graduates are that fine as well. You’re young men and women whose exuberance exude a confident confidence of a bygone era. I believe it was Shakespeare who said it best when he said, “Look yonder into the darkness for knowledge onto which I say go onto that which thou possess into thy night for thee have come with only a single sword and vanquished thee into darkness.”

I’m going to be honest with you, I just made that up. But I don’t know how to delete it from the computer. Tomorrow’s graduation day speaker is former President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo. Ernie’s a good man, a deeply religious man, and one of the original members of the Latino boy band Menudo. So listen up to Ernie. He was at the beginning of the whole boy band explosion.

As you set off into the world, don’t be afraid to question your leaders. But don’t ask too many questions at one time or that are too hard because your leaders get tired and/or cranky. All of you sitting here have the brightest of futures ahead. Many of you will go on to stellar careers and various pursuits. And four of you — and I’m not at liberty to say which four — will go on to star in the porno industry.

One of the challenges you will be faced with is finding a job in our depressed economy. In fact, the chances of landing a decent job are about as good as finding weapons of mass destruction in the Iraqi desert. Slim and none. And Slim just left the building. In fact, the closest thing I found to looking like a weapon of mass destruction is the turd that Dick Cheney left in the Oval Office toilet about an hour ago. Man, that thing is a WMD if I’ve ever seen one. On that note, God bless and happy graduation.

You know, I sincerely hope you enjoy this next chapter of your life because it’s really going to be great, as long as you pay your taxes. And don’t just take a year off because you think Uncle Sam is snoozing at the wheel because he will descend upon you like a hawk from hell. Let’s just put it this way. After some past indiscretions with the IRS, my take-home pay last year was $9,000.

I figured I’d leave you today with a song, if you will. So, Jeff, if you could come up here. Jeff Heck, everyone. Please welcome one of your fellow graduates. Jeff is, of course, from Eliot House. You know what you guys? You guys at Eliot House, give yourselves a nice round of applause because you had the head lice scare this year, and it shut you down for most of last semester. But you didn’t mind the tents they set up for you, and you were just troopers. You really were.

Anyway, here’s a song that I think really captures the essence of the Harvard experience. It goes a little like this.

I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment’s gone,
All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity.
Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.
Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea,
All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see.
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

Okay, you know what? I’m just realizing that this is a terrible graduation song. Once again, I’m sorry. This is the first time I’ve actually listened to the lyrics. Man, it’s a downer. It’s bleak.

Boy, I want to finish this. Just give me a minute, and let me figure out how to fix this thing. Okay. I think I got it.

Now don’t hang on, nothing lasts forever but the Harvard alumni endowment fund.
It adds up, has performed at 22 percent growth over the last six years.
Dust in the wind, you’re so much more than dust in the wind.
Dust in the wind, you’re shiny little very smart pieces of dust in the wind.

Thank you. Good luck. And have a great day tomorrow.

Thank you, President Payton. I would also like to thank the Board of Trustees, the faculty, administration and graduates for the opportunity to address this historic graduating Class of 2003 of Tuskegee University where the first Ph. D. graduates will receive their degrees in Materials Science and Engineering.

So, graduates just by being here today, you are giving your mother the best gift that she could ever receive--and that is the gift of having earned a University degree. Believe me, "it’s the gift that keeps on giving."

I would like to dedicate this Commencement speech and my honorary degree to the memory of my mother and my father, Itasker Frances and Donald Everett Thornton. For without them, both biologically and philosophically, I would not be standing here before you today. They practiced a work ethic and they instilled in me a work ethic. No, I am not one of those Commencement speakers who went from "jail to Yale" or from being "homeless to Harvard." I believe I was asked to speak to you today on this most auspicious occasion of your Commencement because we have a lot in common. And, that is, be underrated and underestimated.

I graduated almost 35 years ago from a small, private teachers’ college in West Long Branch, N.J., known as Monmouth College and you are graduating from a renowned Historically Black University in Alabama. But, Tuskegee University is not just a Black University, it is an American University, with its traditions, culture and pride.
The parcels of land that eventually would become America may have been decreed by noblemen, queens and kings of Europe. But, the strength and true greatness of this country we call America was built on the backs and with the blood and sweat of immigrants, slaves and pioneers — your ancestors and mine.

Tuskegee has experienced both the worst and the best in race relations in this country. The worst being the "Tuskegee experiment" conducted by the United States Public Health Service to study the long-term effects of untreated syphilis on hundreds and hundreds of Black men in Macon County. The best was embodied in the Tuskegee Airmen who performed over 200 bomber escort missions in World War II without losing a single bomber to enemy aircraft. These two disparate chapters in the history of Tuskegee have now come together and have culminated into two great initiatives that I believe will secure the continued excellence at Tuskegee University. The first being the Tuskegee University National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care and the second, the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site. I also understand that there is an on-going Aviation Science program.

The diploma you receive today should not be thought of as a reward, but rather an opportunity, a commitment, an obligation to go forward and continue the life-long process of learning. The elements you have learned at Tuskegee should now be forged into that special compound we call "excellence." Excellence is the antidote to racism, sexism and nepotism. Someone once said, "The key to success is hard work and a little luck." I have found that the harder you work, the luckier you become. What is luck? Luck is when opportunity meets preparation.

For those of you who have read my family biography, entitled, The Ditchdigger’s Daughters, you will recall that I came from a family of six children--all girls and no boys! This was over 50 years ago, over half a century, before affirmative action, Title IX, or equal opportunity. My father was a ditchdigger, a janitor, a laborer. My mother was a cleaning woman who also worked in the factories and sweatshops outside of New York City. Unlike my father, who dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, my mother had three years of college at a former Historically Black University known as Bluefield State Teachers College. However, because she did not complete her four years and did not get her diploma (that "sheepskin" as she would call it), she was consigned to cleaning other peoples’ houses, scrubbing their floors, cooking their meals, and washing their clothes.

However, my parents had a dream for their daughters. They wanted all of us to become doctors (physicians), which was a preposterous idea fifty years ago. Our role models at that time were Ethel Waters with her clothesbasket full of laundry; "Butterfly McQueen" in the movie Gone with the Wind saying, "I don’t know nothin’ ‘bout birthin’ no babies!," Rochester with Jack Benny, and Al Jolson on bended knee singing, in Black-face, of course, "Mammy ." These were our role models. As far as being a woman, they were totally dismissed and were thought of as consolation prizes because the real prize was having a boy to "carry on the name." My sisters and I did not look like Vanessa Williams, Halle Berry or, in those days, Lena Horne. We looked more like the sisters of Buckwheat, if Buckwheat ever had a sister. We were nappy-headed kids from the projects and no one encouraged us to dream the big dreams. No one had any expectations for us, except our parents who believed in us when no one else did. Most of the teenage Black girls became teenage mothers, high school dropouts and on welfare. I would run crying to my father saying that when I told my classmates that I was going to be a doctor, they all told me that they had never had seen a Black doctor, much less a woman doctor. My father told me, "That’s their problem!" My mother would say, "Don’t let anyone define who you are." "Let your reach exceed your grasp, or what’s a heaven for? Let your aims be high, even though fulfillment may seem impossible." "What you can conceive in your mind, believe in your heart, you can achieve with your efforts! Nothing is impossible! It’s just the degree of difficulty!" But, it was this dream of my parents that hardened into a single-minded determination that fueled our lives for many years to come.

As you heard from Dr. Payton, my mother, sisters and I had an all-girl rhythm-and-blues band in the 1950’s and 1960’s. Before American Idol or Star Search, there was a popular talent show on television known as Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour . My sisters and I performed on that show as "The Thornton Sisters" in 1959. A few years later, we won six consecutive Wednesday "Amateur Night" competitions at the world-famous Apollo Theatre in Harlem, the bastion of Black entertainment. We then went on to sign recording contracts with Roulette records and Atlantic Records, perform in rock concerts with our names in lights on the marquee. We told our father to forget about the doctor dream because we were now making money, people loved us and we were on our way to fame and fortune.

My father sat us down and said, "Girls, people love you today, they’ll love someone else tomorrow. We are here for a reason, not a season and we are not going to sacrifice our long-term goals for short term gains. If you are a musician and you break your fingers, your career is over, if you are a singer and lose your voice, no one knows you, if you are an athlete and you break your knees, they’ll get someone else to replace you. But, if you are educated and have a skill, if you are a doctor, who can heal someone and make someone well, then they will come to you because you are respected and are valued."
"You’re 15 or 16 years old now, but if you look to the future when you are 50 or 60 years old, with gray hair, wrinkled skin and arthritic fingers, going up on stage trying to blow a saxophone. Let me tell you something, that ain’t a pretty sight to see! But if you are educated, if you are a doctor with those ‘scripperscraps’ (stethoscopes) hanging around your neck, people may not want to come to see you, but they will have to come to see you because you have a skill and knowledge."

My parents had the wit to value education because they knew that if you are educated, there is no limit to what you can accomplish! Because my parents revered education, we did not become forgotten musicians or faded recording artists, my sisters and I all became well-educated, well-respected, independent, productive women who made that leap up the social mobility ladder from poverty to prosperity in one generation!

What happened to the Ditchdigger’s Daughters, the Thornton Sisters? My oldest sister, Donna, who played tenor saxophone in the band, became a court stenographer; my foster sister became a nurse specializing in geriatric nursing care; my second oldest sister, Jeanette, who played guitar, has a double-doctorate. An Ed.D. (doctorate of education) in counseling psychology and an M.D. from Boston University School of Medicine and is now a psychiatrist. We all went to Monmouth College. My kid sister, Rita, who played keyboards, is now an attorney having graduated from Seton Hall University School of Law; my other sister, Linda, was the drummer in the band--yes, there were female drummers and she was one of the best --Linda graduated from New York University School of Dentistry and is also a retired from the United States Army as a. lieutenant colonel. She is one of only three Black female prosthodontic oral surgeons in the country and is presently on the faculty at Temple University School of Dentistry. She also has an advanced degree in Hospital Administration. Me, I played alto saxophone in the band. I married my medical school sweetheart, Dr. Shearwood McClelland, who is a graduate of Princeton University and is now chairman of orthopaedic surgery at Harlem Hospital in New York City. As you have heard, I was fortunate enough to become the first woman of color in the United States to be Board-certified in High Risk Obstetrics and to date, I have delivered 5489 babies. Talk about Mother’s Day!

Because education has a "ripple effect" my children have benefited from my parents’— their grandparents’ — belief in the power of education. My daughter is a recent graduate of Stanford University. While at Stanford, she was the musical director for Talisman, a popular a cappella campus group who performed at The White House and at the Olympic Games when they were held in Atlanta. She now wants to trade in her CD for an M.D. and is now pursuing a career in medicine. My son, before he went to college, was the United States Junior Open Chess Champion. He graduated cum laude in Biology from Harvard University and is now entering his fourth year as a medical student at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and aspires to be a neurosurgeon.

Each one of us is born with the seeds of success. Our parents, our environment and colleges and universities, like Monmouth and Tuskegee, plant the seeds, till the soil, nurture and nourish each one of us until we develop into that special someone who can compete with anybody, anywhere, at any level. Never underestimate the power of a small college with dedicated faculty. American universities don’t hand out diplomas to people with limited potential. So, if you haven’t been told this before, let me tell you now--members of the Class of 2003; wherever you want to go in life, you can get there from right here! So, I offer you a personal challenge: a challenge to do something remarkable, something more than the ordinary with your life. If my sisters and I, who were written off because we were dark-skinned Black women, can rise to levels of success against all odds, so can you. The diploma you will receive today is just the beginning. That’s why we call it "Commencement!" It will not guarantee you success. If you have a goal, a dream you must be persistent, remain determined with a laser-like focus on what you want. My father would always say to us, "If the front door is closed to you (and it very well may be because you are a Black woman), go around to the back door and see if that is open. If that is closed, go around to the side of the house to see it they left a window open. If that is closed, jump up on the roof to see if you can get it. Just keep trying! Never give up, never, never give up! Because the only person that can stop you is—YOU!"

You are our link to a new generation. You must reassess, re-examine and clarify your priorities and not just be satisfied with the status quo. Whether you go into research, business, law, medicine, public service or education, neither you nor society can continue to survive or prosper simply by implementing what is already known. Somebody is going to have to come up with meaningful new ideas, creative new approaches and important new discoveries. Why can’t that "somebody" be you?

In closing, I want to remind you that the worth of any college or University is measured by the achievements and accomplishments of its graduates and by the loyalty of its alumni. Again, I want to congratulate you on your great accomplishment and offer you my best wishes. To Tuskegee University, who has so graciously bestowed this honor upon me--my mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my family thanks you and most of all, I thank you!

Thank you President Fainstein. My thanks to the members of the Board of Trustees, the faculty, the parents, families, friends, the Connecticut College community, and most important, my thanks and congratulations to the Class of 2004!

I loved my time here at Connecticut College. I was introduced to a new world of opportunity. And there were no constraints for me in becoming involved in new and different challenges.

My professor in freshman American History presented one of my first and quite memorable challenges. The class was given the assignment of writing a 10-page paper in two weeks. I am certain that for all of you, that would be a snap!

However, at my high school, I had never written anything over three pages. Ten pages seemed like a book to me. Using the ingenuity that is a hallmark of Connecticut College students, I wrote the paper. Needless to say, I used rather wide margins.

A few days later, the paper was returned to me. Written on the top were the words that my housemates in Branford remind me of to this day; ÒYou tend to ramble and digress, but reach sound conclusion.Ó It is the Òsound conclusionÓ part that I use as I go forward every day.

And now, not to ramble and digress, I present my address for the Connecticut College Class of 2004 which has to do with American History. I offer to you two words: ÒCritical ThinkingÓ. I believe that critical thinking is the key to our past, our present and our future.

The Declaration of Independence in the second paragraph reads: ÓWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.Ó The people who founded this nation spoke and wrote eloquently of equality, individual rights and freedom.

Then why were these concepts not extended to everyone in our new nation? Why was it that Indians of the First Nations and all people enslaved were excluded? Indeed, why was it possible to have the institution of slavery in a nation founded on these principles?

How could it be that those enslaved were counted as three-fifths of a person? And what consideration was given to women? If men could vote, why exclude women?

The granting of rights exclusively to all of the men who are created equal was clearly inconsistent with the ideas expressed in the documents and in discussions that produced the documents.

One explanation given is that for the people of that time it was not inconsistent with the concepts in our Declaration excludes some people. It was considered acceptable.

Others argue that it was a matter of commerce. The nation needed a strong economy to continue its existence. And, only the men who were Òcreated equalÓ could conduct this necessary commerce.

These answers did not come close to satisfying me. After much critical thought, consideration and debate, I arrived at a conclusion that finally made sense to me. Those who wrote the Declaration of Independence were really saying, ÒWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Òof my friendsÓ are created equalÓÓ

ÒAll of my friendsÓ accurately expresses the thoughts of the day. Landowners, educated, wealthy European men and their male descendants were those for whom the words were written. If you are not my friend and especially if you are not qualified to become my friend, you had little chance for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That bit of critical thinking was very helpful to me. While I still found it totally unacceptable, I could at least better understand why this grand inconsistency existed. The ability to ask ÒWhy?Ó if something appears to be inconsistent is an essential skill for the 21st Century. In fact, I found it rather useful in the last century during my adventures in rowing.

I was introduced to rowing here at Connecticut College in my sophomore year. I loved it. It is an egalitarian sport in the sense that everyone contributes equally to the team. It takes hard work and everyone depends on each other to meet the challenge. It also offers a great deal of time for meditation on the water.

Now, it may have been that I was doing too much meditation, or I was too interested in all of the other things that we do in our senior year for the last time, but it seemed to have affected my performance. In 1974, my senior year at Connecticut College, I was demoted to junior varsity.

How humiliating! During the same conversation in which I was told of my JV fate, the Coach told me that he thought I could make the 1976 Olympic Team! Now, that was seriously inconsistent.

I applied critical thinking. After working to see how these two concepts could fit together, I came to understand why the Coach made that statement to me. He had to make certain that I would continue to row that season so that there could be a JV boat. Without me, there were not enough athletes to fill a JV boat. It worked! I had a great time in that boat and our record was identical to the Varsity that year!

After graduation ceremonies, to the delight of my parents I moved to Philadelphia to attend the University of Pennsylvania Law School. I was interested in law because I believed it to be the language of power. I wanted to be able to use that power to unveil other inconsistencies that prevented our nation from fulfilling its destiny.

And not incidentally, Philadelphia is home to the Vesper Boat Club. Vesper is world-renowned as a club dedicated to creating World and Olympic Champions. I had decided to take on the challenge with which the Coach had condemned me to the JV.

Two years later, I was selected to be a member of the 1976 US Olympic Rowing Team. And my life changed.

In July of 1976, I entered a unique community, the Olympic Village in Montreal. From the outside, it seemed to be a normal housing development with grand buildings dressed with multicolored ribbons from top to bottom. But inside was a community where each member had experienced success. Each athlete, coach or administrator had been successfully chosen to become a member of his or her National Olympic Team.

And you could feel the success and respect for one another throughout the Olympic Village. We all knew that we would be competing for rare distinctions, medals of gold, silver and bronze offered once every four years. We knew how hard we'd worked to come this far. And we knew that there were too many of us for the few medals offered. We were women and men of every size, color and shape. We would sit down at any table in the dining hall, which, by the way was open 24 hours a day, and share a meal with an athlete from a country remote geographically as well as politically. We were joined together in the spirit of mutual respect.

At the end of the day, it did not matter whether you were a champion or whether you had only made it through the first round. We were Olympians each with our own story. And we left with a new respect for those we met, those we competed against and those we watched in competition. We left as ambassadors for a world at peace.

Not satisfied with a bronze medal, I continued to train for the 1980 Olympic Games while finishing my law school and beginning the practice of law. I believed that I could win a gold medal. That goal was shattered by yet another serious inconsistency that crossed my path.

In early 1980, in an effort to stop Soviet aggression against Afghanistan, our US Government decided to use our Olympic Team as a weapon against the Soviet Union and announced a boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow. The actions of our government were totally inconsistent with the concept of the Olympic Games, Olympians compete and live together in peace and build bridges for better understanding.

The decision was made to use an instrument of peace to fight the Òcold war.Ó Then, as now, US Olympians had not received a penny of assistance from the government for any training purpose. I felt then, and feel today, that if a decision needed to be made regarding participation in the Olympic Games, that decision was solely the prerogative of the athletes. I had to stand against the government.

Alas, in the court of public opinion and in the court of law I lost. Yet it was essential that we athletes had taken a stand. We knew the important value of standing up for our beliefs.

Harriet Tubman, an extraordinarily brave American, said: ÒI had reasoned this out in my mind, there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other."

Her critical thinking gave her a good idea of the risks before her and she stood up against those risks.

My experiences, first at Connecticut College and then with the Olympic Games, have taught me the importance of critical thinking. Critical thinking is an essential tool for examining the many issues that face us.

And, we need to believe in the possibility of success as we solve those issues. Every athlete who enters the Olympic Village believes that they will meet with success.

As you take this step from academia to the world community, you have reason to meet with great success. But you have to pay attention to what is going on around you. We are assaulted with claims of truth, with commercials testifying to the good of the product or the person. Do you really believe that the New York Times gives you ÒAll the news that's fit to print?Ó Do you believe that reality shows are real? Does Burger King really let you ÒHave it your wayÓ? Is Fox News really "Fair and balanced"?

Print and electronic media keep telling us their truth on events of the day. On most TV and radio stations and in newspapers, it is the same story given to us. And in a world where journalists interview one another, what else can we expect?

The concentration of media ownership makes it possible to have music or information banned distribution. The editorial policy of that media conglomerate can be in the position of silencing those views.

Unfortunately, the stories of success and kindness are rarely deemed appropriate as news. I believe that we can successfully change this situation. In the late 60Ós and 70Ós, we shouted, ÒQuestion Authority!Ó

Now, in the 21st century we must employ critical thinking about authority.

Is it really the truth they are telling us, or only the truth for all of their friends?

We are too experienced and too well educated to lead our lives as puppets. We cannot afford to listen silently then nod our heads and move on. We must not squander our education. We dare not squander our integrity. We must be brave to think critically. We must be free to believe in ourselves.

Benjamin Franklin told us that, ÒAnyone who would sacrifice liberty for temporary security deserves neither security nor freedom.Ó

Friends, our challenge is to live the final stanza of a song you have heard or sung hundreds of times.

We must live up to the promise in the final line of that anthem. I challenge all of us to make this true. Make it so that we live in ÒÒ The land of the free and the home of the brave!Ó

Class of 2004, it is your choice!

My name is Bono and I am a rock star. Don't get me too excited because I use four letter words when I get excited. I'd just like to say to the parents, your children are safe, your country is safe, the FCC has taught me a lesson and the only four letter word I'm going to use today is P-E-N-N. Come to think of it 'Bono' is a four-letter word. The whole business of obscenity--I don't think there's anything certainly more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes. It's a bit like when people put their King Charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats. It's not natural, and it doesn't make the dog any smarter.

It's true we were here before with U2 and I would like to thank them for giving me a great life, as well as you. I've got a great rock and roll band that normally stand in the back when I'm talking to thousands of people in a football stadium and they were here with me, I think it was seven years ago. Actually then I was with some other sartorial problems. I was wearing a mirror-ball suit at the time and I emerged from a forty-foot high revolving lemon. It was sort of a cross between a space ship, a disco and a plastic fruit.

I guess it was at that point when your Trustees decided to give me their highest honor. Doctor of Laws, wow! I know it's an honor, and it really is an honor, but are you sure? Doctor of Law, all I can think about is the laws I've broken. Laws of nature, laws of physics, laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and on a memorable night in the late seventies, I think it was Newton's law of motion...sickness. No, it's true, my resume reads like a rap sheet. I have to come clean; I've broken a lot of laws, and the ones I haven't I've certainly thought about. I have sinned in thought, word, and deed. God forgive me. Actually God forgave me, but why would you? I'm here getting a doctorate, getting respectable, getting in the good graces of the powers that be, I hope it sends you students a powerful message: Crime does pay.

So I humbly accept the honor, keeping in mind the words of a British playwright, John Mortimer it was, "No brilliance is needed in the law. Nothing but common sense and relatively clean fingernails." Well at best I've got one of the two of those.

But no, I never went to college, I've slept in some strange places, but the library wasn't one of them. I studied rock and roll and I grew up in Dublin in the '70s, music was an alarm bell for me, it woke me up to the world. I was 17 when I first saw The Clash, and it just sounded like revolution. The Clash were like, "This is a public service announcement--with guitars." I was the kid in the crowd who took it at face value. Later I learned that a lot of the rebels were in it for the T-shirt. They'd wear the boots but they wouldn't march. They'd smash bottles on their heads but they wouldn't go to something more painful like a town hall meeting. By the way I felt like that myself until recently.

I didn't expect change to come so slow, so agonizingly slow. I didn't realize that the biggest obstacle to political and social progress wasn't the Free Masons, or the Establishment, or the boot heal of whatever you consider 'the Man' to be, it was something much more subtle. As the Provost just referred to, a combination of our own indifference and the Kafkaesque labyrinth of 'no's you encounter as people vanish down the corridors of bureaucracy.

So for better or worse that was my education. I came away with a clear sense of the difference music could make in my own life, in other peoples' lives if I did my job right. Which if you're a singer in a rock band means avoiding the obvious pitfalls like, say, a mullet hairdo. If anyone here doesn't know what a mullet is by the way your education's certainly not complete, I'd ask for your money back. For a lead singer like me, a mullet is, I would suggest, arguably more dangerous than a drug problem. Yes, I had a mullet in the '80s.

Now this is the point where the members of the faculty start smiling uncomfortably and thinking maybe they should have offered me the honorary bachelors degree instead of the full blown doctorate, (he should have been the bachelor's one, he's talking about mullets and stuff). If they're asking what on earth I'm doing here, I think it's a fair question. What am I doing here? More to the point: what are you doing here? Because if you don't mind me saying so this is a strange ending to an Ivy League education. Four years in these historic halls thinking great thoughts and now you're sitting in a stadium better suited for football listening to an Irish rock star give a speech that is so far mostly about himself. What are you doing here?

Actually I saw something in the paper last week about Kermit the Frog giving a commencement address somewhere. One of the students was complaining, "I worked my ass off for four years to be addressed by a sock?" You have worked your ass off for this. For four years you've been buying, trading, and selling, everything you've got in this marketplace of ideas. The intellectual hustle. Your pockets are full, even if your parents' are empty, and now you've got to figure out what to spend it on.

Well, the going rate for change is not cheap. Big ideas are expensive. The University has had its share of big ideas. Benjamin Franklin had a few, so did Justice Brennen and in my opinion so does Judith Rodin. What a gorgeous girl. They all knew that if you're gonna be good at your word if you're gonna live up to your ideals and your education, its' gonna cost you.

So my question I suppose is: What's the big idea? What's your big idea? What are you willing to spend your moral capital, your intellectual capital, your cash, your sweat equity in pursuing outside of the walls of the University of Pennsylvania?

There's a truly great Irish poet his name is Brendan Kennelly,  and he has this epic poem called the Book of Judas, and there's a line in that poem that never leaves my mind, it says: "If you want to serve the age, betray it." What does that mean to betray the age?

Well to me betraying the age means exposing its conceits, it's foibles; it's phony moral certitudes. It means telling the secrets of the age and facing harsher truths.

Every age has its massive moral blind spots. We might not see them, but our children will. Slavery was one of them and the people who best served that age were the ones who called it as it was--which was ungodly and inhuman. Ben Franklin called it what it was when he became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.

Segregation. There was another one. America sees this now but it took a civil rights movement to betray their age. And 50 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court betrayed the age May 17, 1954, Brown vs. Board of Education came down and put the lie to the idea that separate can ever really be equal. Amen to that. 

Fast forward 50 years. May 17, 2004. What are the ideas right now worth betraying? What are the lies we tell ourselves now? What are the blind spots of our age? What's worth spending your post-Penn lives trying to do or undo? It might be something simple.

It might be something as simple as our deep down refusal to believe that every human life has equal worth. Could that be it? Could that be it? Each of you will probably have your own answer, but for me that is it. And for me the proving ground has been Africa.

Africa makes a mockery of what we say, at least what I say, about equality and questions our pieties and our commitments because there's no way to look at what's happening over there and it's effect on all of us and conclude that we actually consider Africans as our equals before God. There is no chance.

An amazing event happened here in Philadelphia in 1985--Live Aid--that whole We Are The World phenomenon the concert that happened here.  Well after that concert I went to Ethiopia with my wife, Ali. We were there for a month and an extraordinary thing happened to me. We used to wake up in the morning and the mist would be lifting we'd see thousands and thousands of people who'd been walking all night to our food station were we were working. One man--I was standing outside talking to the translator--had this beautiful boy and he was saying to me in Amharic, I think it was, I said I can't understand what he's saying, and this nurse who spoke English and Amharic said to me, he's saying will you take his son. He's saying please take his son, he would be a great son for you. I was looking puzzled and he said, "You must take my son because if you don't take my son, my son will surely die. If you take him he will go back to Ireland and get an education." Probably like the ones we're talking about today. I had to say no, that was the rules there and I walked away from that man, I've never really walked away from it. But I think about that boy and that man and that's when I started this journey that's brought me here into this stadium.

Because at that moment I became the worst scourge on God's green earth, a rock star with a cause. Christ! Except it isn't the cause. Seven thousand Africans dying every day of preventable, treatable disease like AIDS? That's not a cause, that's an emergency. And when the disease gets out of control because most of the population live on less than one dollar a day? That's not a cause, that's an emergency. And when resentment builds because of unfair trade rules and the burden of unfair debt, that are debts by the way that keep Africans poor? That's not a cause, that's an emergency.  So--We Are The World, Live Aid, start me off it was an extraordinary thing and really that event was about charity. But 20 years on I'm not that interested in charity. I'm interested in justice. There's a difference. Africa needs justice as much as it needs charity.

Equality for Africa is a big idea. It's a big expensive idea. I see the Wharton graduates now getting out the math on the back of their programs, numbers are intimidating aren't they, but not to you!  But the scale of the suffering and the scope of the commitment they often numb us into a kind of indifference. Wishing for the end to AIDS and extreme poverty in Africa is like wishing that gravity didn't make things so damn heavy.  We can wish it, but what the hell can we do about it?

Well, more than we think. We can't fix every problem--corruption, natural calamities are part of the picture here--but the ones we can we must. The debt burden, as I say, unfair trade, as I say, sharing our knowledge, the intellectual copyright for lifesaving drugs in a crisis, we can do that. And because we can, we must. Because we can, we must. Amen.

This is the straight truth, the righteous truth. It's not a theory, it's a fact. The fact is that this generation--yours, my generation--that can look at the poverty, we're the first generation that can look at poverty and disease, look across the ocean to Africa and say with a straight face, we can be the first to end this sort of stupid extreme poverty, where in the world of plenty, a child can die for lack of food in it's belly. We can be the first generation. It might take a while, but we can be that generation that says no to stupid poverty. It's a fact, the economists confirm it. It's an expensive fact but, cheaper than say the Marshall Plan that saved Europe from communism and fascism. And cheaper I would argue than fighting wave after wave of terrorism's new recruits. That's the economics department over there, very good.

It's a fact. So why aren't we pumping our fists in the air and cheering about it? Well probably because when we admit we can do something about it, we've got to do something about it. For the first time in history we have the know how, we have the cash, we have the lifesaving drugs, but do we have the will?

Yesterday, here in Philadelphia, at the Liberty Bell, I met a lot of Americans who do have the will. From arch-religious conservatives to young secular radicals, I just felt an incredible overpowering sense that this was possible. We're calling it the ONE campaign, to put an end to AIDS and extreme poverty in Africa. They believe we can do it, so do I.

I really, really do believe it. I just want you to know, I think this is obvious, but I'm not really going in for the warm fuzzy feeling thing, I'm not a hippy, I do not have flowers in my hair, I come from punk rock, The Clash wore army boots not Birkenstocks. I believe America can do this! I believe that this generation can do this. In fact I want to hear an argument about why we shouldn't.

I know idealism is not playing on the radio right now, you don't see it on TV, irony is on heavy rotation, the knowingness, the smirk, the tired joke. I've tried them all out but I'll tell you this, outside this campus--and even inside it--idealism is under siege beset by materialism, narcissism and all the other isms of indifference. Baggism, Shaggism. Raggism. Notism, graduationism, chismism, I don't know. Where's John Lennon when you need him.

But I don't want to make you cop to idealism, not in front of your parents, or your younger siblings. But what about Americanism? Will you cop to that at least? It's not everywhere in fashion these days, Americanism. Not very big in Europe, truth be told. No less on Ivy League college campuses. But it all depends on your definition of Americanism.

Me, I'm in love with this country called America. I'm a huge fan of America, I'm one of those annoying fans, you know the ones that read the CD notes and follow you into bathrooms and ask you all kinds of annoying questions about why you didn't live up to that?.

I'm that kind of fan. I read the Declaration of Independence and I've read the Constitution of the United States, and they are some liner notes, dude. As I said yesterday I made my pilgrimage to Independence Hall, and I love America because America is not just a country, it's an idea. You see my country, Ireland, is a great country, but it's not an idea. America is an idea, but it's an idea that brings with it some baggage, like power brings responsibility. It's an idea that brings with it equality, but equality even though it's the highest calling, is the hardest to reach. The idea that anything is possible, that's one of the reasons why I'm a fan of America. It's like hey, look there's the moon up there, lets take a walk on it, bring back a piece of it. That's the kind of America that I'm a fan of.

In 1771 your founder Mr. Franklin spent three months in Ireland and Scotland to look at the relationship they had with England to see if this could be a model for America, whether America should follow their example and remain a part of the British Empire.

Franklin was deeply, deeply distressed by what he saw. In Ireland he saw how England had put a stranglehold on Irish trade, how absentee English landlords exploited Irish tenant farmers and how those farmers in Franklin's words "lived in retched hovels of mud and straw, were clothed in rags and subsisted chiefly on potatoes." Not exactly the American dream...

So instead of Ireland becoming a model for America, America became a model for Ireland in our own struggle for independence.

When the potatoes ran out, millions of Irish men, women and children packed their bags got on a boat and showed up right here. And we're still doing it. We're not even starving anymore, loads of potatoes. In fact if there's any Irish out there, I've breaking news from Dublin, the potato famine is over you can come home now. But why are we still showing up? Because we love the idea of America.

We love the crackle and the hustle, we love the spirit that gives the finger to fate, the spirit that says there's no hurdle we can't clear and no problem we can't fix. (sound of helicopter) Oh, here comes the Brits, only joking. No problem we can't fix. So what's the problem that we want to apply all this energy and intellect to?

Every era has its defining struggle and the fate of Africa is one of ours. It's not the only one, but in the history books it's easily going to make the top five, what we did or what we did not do. It's a proving ground, as I said earlier, for the idea of equality. But whether it's this or something else, I hope you'll pick a fight and get in it. Get your boots dirty, get rough, steel your courage with a final drink there at Smoky Joe's, one last primal scream and go.

Sing the melody line you hear in your own head, remember, you don't owe anybody any explanations, you don't owe your parents any explanations, you don't owe your professors any explanations. You know I used to think the future was solid or fixed, something you inherited like an old building that you move into when the previous generation moves out or gets chased out.

But it's not. The future is not fixed, it's fluid. You can build your own building, or hut or condo, whatever; this is the metaphor part of the speech by the way.

But my point is that the world is more malleable than you think and it's waiting for you to hammer it into shape. Now if I were a folksinger I'd immediately launch into "If I Had a Hammer" right now get you all singing and swaying. But as I say I come from punk rock, so I'd rather have the bloody hammer right here in my fist.

That's what this degree of yours is, a blunt instrument. So go forth and build something with it. Remember what John Adams said about Ben Franklin, "He does not hesitate at our boldest Measures but rather seems to think us too irresolute."

Well this is the time for bold measures. This is the country, and you are the generation. Thank you

What’s up, Mad City?!

It’s great to be back in my hometown. On behalf of the acting president of the United States, I want to congratulate you all on your tremendous achievement.

A commencement address is what we call in show business a tough gig. You’ve got a huge room, you’ve got a big, distracted crowd that thinks they know everything about everything – and probably stayed out a little too late last night celebrating. I heard you at the hotel, by the way. And you’ve got a bunch of family members of various ages who you have to worry about offending if you happen to get a little too honest.

Somebody once said it’s like being the body at a wake. They stick you in the middle of the room, but deep down they really don’t want to hear a lot out of you.

The sad truth is, I don’t even remember who the speaker was at my graduation. I remember squinting a lot and a vague sense that I would never again be around so many attractive, available young people in my life. It is my solemn duty to inform you that that fear is entirely well founded. This is coming from a guy who works in Hollywood, by the way.

So I begin this address not only with the full expectation that I will soon be forgotten, but with the additional humiliation that there will probably be no one there to remind you of who I was.

I just want to take a moment to note that the commencement speaker at Concordia College this year was the president of the United States, George W. Bush. Concordia has about 5,000 students. The University of Wisconsin has about 40,000. Yes, my friends, the question hangs over this beautiful Kohl Center like a foul stench. Why couldn’t you get a more significant speaker?

Why would the University of Wisconsin, a school with a reputation and the stature to attract a genuine world leader – at least some uncelebrated public servant – the guy who runs the dog pound in Baraboo – somebody, for God’s sake! Why would you opt instead for a glorified circus clown from a television show? I can’t answer that question, my friends. This is uncomfortable for all of us. I feel your shame.

One thing I can tell you is that Concordia College is getting ripped off. George Bush did not write that speech. No way! A bunch of invisible White House lackeys, otherwise known as speechwriters, wrote it for him. And he just strutted up to the podium, he read it, and then he rode off into the sunset in his little taxpayer-funded 747.

Now, you may think that I am inappropriately taking this opportunity to attack the president on a meaningless issue because of my particular political persuasion — and you would be correct. But I hereby challenge the leader of the free world to swear under oath that he wrote every word of the commencement address that he delivered. It is not gonna happen.

Yes, friends, take solace in the fact that if you had actually paid me anything to come here today, you would be about to get your money’s worth. For better or for worse, this horribly disappointing choice of a commencement speaker had to write his own speech.

The first problem I faced when confronted with this grim task was that, as my wife and children will attest, aside from drinking coffee, I have only two areas of expertise – reproduction and acting. Let me begin with the one that I don’t mind blabbing about to a room full of strangers — acting.

You know, I get it. I know that it’s not the most respectable way to make a living. I am perpetually assaulted by examples of children, quadrupeds and a wide variety of insufferable idiots who are, on occasion, capable of acting beautifully. This fills my life with bitterness.

The good news is that if you keep at it long enough and you actually get to make a living at this glorified high school extracurricular activity, you not only get a little better at it — given enough chances, even a chimpanzee may type a dictionary — but you begin to see that the process of acting has the potential to show us a little bit about how we might act a little better in our real lives. It comes down to about six basic principles. I call them "Everything I Need to Know in Life I Learned on My Way to a Humiliating Audition," and they go like this:

Number One: Fall in love with the process and the results will follow. You’ve got to want to act more than you want to be an actor. You’ve got to want to do whatever you want to do more than you want to be whatever you want to be, want to write more than you want to be a writer, want to heal more than you want to be a doctor, want to teach more than you want to be a teacher, want to serve more than you want to be a politician. Life is too challenging for external rewards to sustain us. The joy is in the journey.

Number Two: Very obvious – do your work. When faced with the terror of an opening night on Broadway, you can either dissolve in a puddle of fear or you can get yourself ready. Drown out your inevitable self-doubt with the work that needs to be done. Find joy in the process of preparation.

Number Three: Once you’re prepared, throw your preparation in the trash. The most interesting acting and the most interesting living in this world has the element of surprise and of genuine, honest discovery. Be open to that. You’ve all spent the majority of your lives in school, where your work is assigned to you and you’re supposed to please your teachers.

The pressure to get into wonderful institutions like this is threatening to create a generation of what I call hiney-kissing requirement-fulfillers. You are all so much more than that. You’ve reached the wonderful and terrifying moment where you must be your own guide. Listen to the whispers inside you. We have a lot of problems in this world and we’re going to need you to think outside the box.

Number Four: You are capable of more than you think. If you’ve ever smashed a mosquito on your arm, there is a murderous Richard III inside you. If you’ve ever caught your breath at the sight of someone dipping their toes into Lake Mendota in the late afternoon sun over at the Union, you, too, have Romeo’s fluttering heart.

Now, I’m not advocating that you all go out and bleach your hair so that you can play the jerk in a really stupid Adam Sandler movie. I don’t know what kind of an idiot would think that is a worthwhile way to spend their life. But don’t limit yourselves. Take it from the professional extrovert – the most gregarious among us are far more insecure than we would ever admit. We all go through life bristling at our external limitations, but the most difficult chains to break are inside us.

One of the few graduation speakers who will never be forgotten, Nelson Mandela, put it this way:

"Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?’ Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world."

Let’s just take a moment to hope that Nelson Mandela and Adam Sandler never again share a paragraph.

Number Five: Listen. It is the most difficult thing an actor can do and it is the most riveting. You can’t afford to spend your life like a bad actor stumbling through a predetermined performance that is oblivious to the world around you. We can’t afford it either. Listening isn’t passive. It is an act of liberation that will connect you to the world with compassion and be your best guide as you navigate the choppy waters of love, work and citizenship.

And finally, Number Six: Take action. Every story you’ve ever connected with, every leader you’ve ever admired, every puny little thing that you’ve ever accomplished is the result of taking action. You have a choice. You can either be a passive victim of circumstance or you can be the active hero of your own life. Action is the antidote to apathy and cynicism and despair. You will inevitably make mistakes. Learn what you can and move on. At the end of your days, you will be judged by your gallop, not by your stumble.

Many of you started here in the fall of 2000. You go out into a world we could not have imagined four years ago. Ominous threats seek to distract us from achieving our spectacular potential as individuals, as a nation and as a delicate, shrinking planet. We need you.

Come as you are, armed with nothing more than the tools of a mediocre television actor. All we need is for you to find joy in your journey, to find satisfaction in hard work, to be aware of what is happening around you, to free yourself from your imagined limitations, to listen, and finally, to act – not to play make believe. This isn’t a television show. The choices are difficult and the consequences are real.

No matter where you stand politically, we need you to participate in an urgent discussion about the future that we will all share. Some will question your qualifications to participate. We get a lot of that in Hollywood. I like to tell those people that there is nothing less American than telling another American to shut up – so they should shut up.

This is especially true when the stakes are so high. In the words of the great World War II hero and former U.S. Senator George McGovern, "The highest patriotism is not blind allegiance to official policy, but a love of one’s country deep enough to hold her to a higher standard."

It has always been up to the people to hold this country up to its spectacular promise. Make no mistake about it – if you choose not to participate at the ballot box or in the urgent discussion about the world that we will one day pass on to the next generation, you no longer live in a democracy. You have sentenced yourself to a civic gulag dictated by the whims of those who choose to participate.

In short, my obnoxiously young friends, you don’t just get democracy – you have to make it happen. I urge you to extend that call to action to every aspect of your lives.

Let me be clear – I want you all to stay the hell out of show business. The last thing I need is a bunch of young people invading my job market.

But I do want you to be an actor in your own life. Infuse your life with action. Don’t wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen — yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.

I will leave you with something I have learned from my only other area of expertise, besides the coffee — being a father. We sit in the shade of trees planted long ago. We have all arrived at this wonderful moment together because of countless gestures of hope made by generations that have preceded us — the baby born, the family begun, the university founded, the care and nurturing of our schools, our communities, a wonderful variety of faiths and, of course, our families and their families before them.

The line of fire racing across time that we call life is burning brightly in all of you at this moment. We celebrate the joy of your achievement, but we must give thanks for all that brought us here. And we must be keenly aware that our stupendous good fortune carries with it an obligation to keep that flame burning brightly into the future for every living thing that is and is yet to be.

Congratulations, Class of 2004. Go out and plant some trees! Thank you.

Aloha to Chancellor Rose Tseng, distinguished faculty, graduates, parents, and other honored guests. Thank you for the opportunity to address these marvelous young people today. I would like to congratulate each of them for the work, time, and effort they have put into their degrees. Francine, wherever life takes you, please stop at a Medtronic office. Your talents in psychology and communication are much needed by our company. We have over 2000 job openings in 120 countries and every major city on the U.S. mainland.
My compliments also to your department of Hawaiian Studies and Languages; this is a grand thing for our state. We must preserve the Hawaiian culture and language for future generations. The spirit of aloha contains much wisdom and compassion.

I would like to recognize three friends of mine who are here today. Together we hope to bring some major advances to the island. Max Goldberger is an alternative energy expert; Ron Toms is a rocket scientist; and John Craven is a submarine expert and Naval scientist. My aloha to all of you.

My talk this morning will be on five habits that will be important to you when you leave this university. They are often overlooked, but have meant a lot to me.

1. Pick a company or organization that is dedicated to helping humanity. 

Then your life will be dedicated to a worthy cause. In 1949 I started a company called Medtronic to repair medical electronic equipment. We began with two people, and now have over 31,000 employees in 120 countries around the world. In our first month we made eight dollars; this year the implantable electronic devices Medtronic has developed will make nearly nine billion dollars.

In 1960 Medtronic created a mission statement, something not often done at the time. The company’s mission became my personal mission. Two weeks from now, I will be leading a "mission ceremony" in Minneapolis for 300 new employees who are making Medtronic’s mission their own.

One of our products is now implanted someplace in the world every six seconds. These devices can save a life or make a sick person well again. With millions of people receiving these devices, I am continually running into them. They say, "Mr. Bakken, I am alive because of your work," or "Mr. Bakken, you gave my child a good life she could not have had without the device." The experience is always very moving, very satisfying. If you join the right company or organization you will receive this kind of gratitude.

2. Do more work than is required.

Find ways to go beyond the specifics of your task. Learn new things. Find work outside your direct assignment. Through high school I worked summers. My job was to run the copying machine. I started learning to use a desk comptometer on my lunch breaks. The boss needed another person to do the billing, and I got the job. Today, I still work all week, as well as most weekends and holidays. You need a strong passion and enthusiasm for your work. Above all, be on time! Surprise people.

3. "Ready, Fire, Aim."
This is the approach I have used all my life. There are always decisions to be made. In my experience, it is better not to get caught up in over-analysis of a problem. Many of the decisions at Medtronic were made very quickly. The first pacemaker took only four weeks from concept to first use. The original design was not perfect, of course, but it worked. So if you feel positive in your gut, in your na ‘au, about your idea – do it. Don’t get stuck in the limbo of "Ready, Aim...Aim...Aim..."—and let someone else do the "Firing." Be there first!

4. Study continuously.
Knowledge is increasing so rapidly—it is exponential. With the way things are going, the technical information you have learned in school will be obsolete in two years! You need to continue to read and learn all of your life. Today I receive 178 magazines and journals. I can’t read them all and mostly scan them, but I try to keep up. Continue the joy of learning, always.

5. Dream "out of the box." Be creative!
The North Hawaii Community Hospital is very different from any other hospital in the world. It is designed to help heal the patients, rather than as a warehouse for their sick bodies. Making the building a part of the healing environment—with skylights, wide halls, and music—is what we call "blended medicine." The devices developed by Medtronic, the programs at Tutu’s House, the "Just Think" Mobile, the Bakken Museum, my "off the grid" home at Kiholo Bay—all these are "thinking out of the box."
Live your life according to these five principles and follow your dreams. You can shape the future to make your dreams come true, but you must work for it. Don’t just hope it will happen.

By all reckoning, the bumblebee is aerodynamically unsound and shouldn’t be able to fly. Yet, the little bee gets those wings going like a turbo-jet and flies to every plant its chubby little body can land on to collect all the nectar it can hold. Bumblebees are the most persistent creatures. They don’t know they can’t fly, so they just keep buzzing around. Like the lowly bumblebee, honored graduates, never give in to pessimism. Don’t know that you can’t fly, and you will soar like an eagle. Don’t end up regretting what you did not do because you were too lazy or too frightened to soar. Be a bumblebee! And soar to the heavens. You can do it. Godspeed to you all.

Thank you very much. It's really a privilege for me to be here and celebrate with you on this beautiful day. I also wish my mother-in-law was here to see what I was doing today because I still have to convince her, on a daily basis, that her daughter made the right choice many years ago.

I'm honored to be here because I also, as a parent myself, can feel the joy of your parents and friends who are here. As a parent, I remember the birth of my first son as if it was yesterday, and I can tell you, your parents also remember those 22 years ago and days when you were born. For you, those 22 years may have seemed very long and arduous, but I can tell you, for parents, they are very short. They all remember you as a baby, and they can't believe you have become such a formidable graduate of one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. And that's an illustration of what I call the relativity principle of time and aging. The older you are, the faster time seems to go by, and the faster tuition bills seem to come through, as well. But, you know, you are the legacy of your parents to this world, and they all deserve our heartfelt recognition for doing such a good job, and I'd like all the graduates, if you don't mind, to give a round of applause to your parents.

It's also a great honor for me to give this address in the last year of President Charles Vest's extraordinary tenure at MIT. There's no question that Dr. Vest, from my point of view as a federal agency official, today is one of the most influential thought leaders in higher education. He has this rare combination that you don't find a lot in life that combines vision and flawless execution. Well, last night, he conducted the Boston Pops with a flawless execution, I hear. President Vest, we're impressed.

Recently my younger son, Adam, actually was initiated in a fraternity called Phi Kappa Psi, and as I was checking to make sure that this was a good fraternity, a decent one, I found out that Dr. Vest was a member of that fraternity. So when people ask me now about my son, Adam, I say, "Oh, don't worry, he belongs to the exact same fraternity Dr. Vest belongs to." So I'm very proud to do this in his last year.

What can you say to 2,200 very bright graduates that will make a difference in telling them about where you see life and where you see a field of science, where you see yourself? As I was preparing my speech, I was looking at what was the best strategy to do that, and I came across the story of a Commencement speaker at Yale University, who had the great idea of using every letter of the Yale name as a starting concept. So he used Y for youth, and he went on and on about youth. And then he used A for ability, which you all have, and he went on and on. And from the back of the room, somebody said, "Thank God we're not the Massachusetts Institute of Technology!" So I give up on that strategy, I'm not going to use that strategy today.

Instead I'll tell you about what I think are the very critical both scientific challenges of the 21st century, but also what is your role in it. The challenge, frankly, for us in the 21st century, is one that we have brought upon ourselves, and I'll just go back in history a little bit to give you the perspective of how I see it. When you think about the universe, you hear that about 13.7 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and off of that Big Bang came the universe, and then planets and solar systems and galaxies organized themselves, that was the first big bang. But there were other Big Bangs. The Earth came about five billion years ago, and about four billion years ago, with a mysterious event, life appeared. And what happened is that through replication of very special molecules, DNA and RNA, something very unique happened whereby natural evolution allowed, through multiple variations and survival of the fittest, the emergence of a very diverse life on earth.

But there is a third Big Bang, and this is the one you're living in today, which you have to take account of, and that is the Big Bang of knowledge. It occurred about 100,000 years ago when about 10,000d individuals, at most--as we look at the genome and we look at the variation of the genome across the human population, it is very clear that all of us have come from the same founding population of 10,000 individuals in Africa about a hundred thousand years ago. So we're not that different from each other, in historical terms.

And yet that changed the game of life because, through knowledge, through our ability, through our intelligence, we're able to transfer information from one child, from one parent to a child, from a parent to another one and, through generations, we're able to develop tools of adaptation the world has never seen. We've been able to change our environment at a speed, at a velocity that is much faster than what we can adapt to ourselves through our natural mechanisms of natural evolution.

Let me give you an example. Obesity is an emerging public health threat. This year the Centers for Disease Control said that obesity is the second [leading] cause of premature mortality and morbidity in this country. Now why is that? Because for millions of years, our genes evolved in the context of food scarcity. There was not a lot of food around us for millions of years. And all of a sudden, because of our intelligence, because of our knowledge, we changed that in less than 50 years. Most of our genes are in fact designed to allow you to accumulate energy and keep that energy, which then translates itself into overweight and obesity.

Well, what are we going to do about it? What I will dare to say to you is that life sciences and their applications will be the defining challenge of the 21st century, bar none. And the reason is that we are changing our environment at a speed which will require us to understand life sciences to a degree we do not understand today. And let me tell you, it will require the intelligence and commitment of many classes of graduates like yours. The solution will not come from biology alone. It will come from the integration of biology and computer sciences and mathematics and physics and chemistry, and we want to encourage that to happen.

Why is this a great opportunity for you? Let me tell you a little story. A few weeks ago, I was at a meeting of the annual convention of all the biotechnology executives. All the CEOs of the many biotechnology companies in this country were there, assembled in New York, with their investment bankers. Now you know this must be a very important meeting for someone who is trying to get funds for their idea, and I conducted a poll. And I said to them, I am the director of the NIH [and] I want to ask you a question. How much do you think you know of what you need to know to be effective in combating obesity or diabetes and any of the health care challenges that we have in front of us?

Now the question: Do you think you know 90 percent of what you need to know? And no one answered that. Fifty percent? No one raised their hand. Twenty percent? No one raised their hand. So I said, well, what about less than 10 percent? Everybody raised their hand. This is from the leaders of life sciences today. So think about it. Think how much opportunity there is in front of you. Ninety percent of what there is to discover is still ahead of us.

Now I turned to the investment bankers, and I said, "Well, I don't understand this. You are investing good dollars on people who just admitted in front of you that they know less than 10 percent of what they need to know." Can you imagine? And the reason is simple. It is such a great challenge, and the risk/reward is so great. If you can find just a cure for one of the major diseases of mankind, you will affect that relationship between our environment and ourselves. So it's important, I think, to keep that in perspective and to understand that there is a real race going on between our ability to understand how we respond to our environment biologically and our ability to change that environment in ways and consequences that we, with consequences that we may not always predict.

As the NIH director, I have to give you some advice about how to conduct yourselves then for the next challenge, if that's the challenge that we think is there, and I can only do this with no certainty, obviously, about what the right answer is. I can only talk to you about myself and the rules I've used in life to go around and do this.

First and foremost, I learned one thing, because I came from another country, actually, I came from Algeria when I was 24 years old to America. I immigrated, and I had $300 in my pocket, new wife, no friends, no family, and basically this is where I learned that you can't make a contribution unless you're connected to others and you're able to connect to others. So I developed these rules called my 50/50 rules. You have to have a balance in life because you never know when you're going to need the interactions of others.

So what are these 50/50 rules? Well, the first rule that I'd like to share with you is this. Today you're going to receive a diploma. What you know today, I can assure you, is 50 percent wrong and 50 percent right. The challenge for you now is to figure out what part is right and what part is wrong. Now don't take my speech as an excuse to go and ask for a reimbursement on your tuition. I don't think they will do that. But, on the other hand, I think it's a very important way to look at the knowledge fund that you have as new scientists, new graduates of MIT.

I think it is important to also realize that in life many of your contributions will not come from your core discipline. They will come from disciplines that you probably have no contact with, typically, and this is the other 50/50 rule that I would like to leave you with. Read 50 percent of what you read in the area that you're interested in, but make sure that 50 percent of what you read is unrelated to what you have to do.

I did this consistently because I had to learn a new language, I had to connect with new friends and new disciplines. Fifty percent of what I read was in radiology. I loved medical imaging because it combined mathematics and physics, which I love, and medicine, which I think gave me the human contact, and that's why I worked and made these contributions. But 50 percent of the time I would read things outside of radiology.

It's really fun to see the world that way, but it's also more fun to understand that you are smarter when you're in the company of smarter people than you. It is amazing to see the enrichment that you get from interacting with others. So my rule is that 50 percent of my friends have to be from walks of life that are not directly related to my walk of life and, more importantly, I try to make sure that at least 50 percent of my friends are smarter than I am. Because you can be assured that at least half of your life contributions will be stimulated by others that are interacting with you, and you will stimulate others, as well.

Often you hear about the spark of genius that somebody had, this unique individual, and we all admire these individuals, but it's rarely true that it happens to people who are completely isolated. Throughout scientific history, you've always had that interaction of people, founder groups, that got together and created new advances. Witness Watson and Crick. Watson was a zoologist and Crick was a physicist. In coming together, they created the field of molecular biology. Now look at laboratories around the world that have been very productive. They've been productive because they have, in fact, encouraged the clustering of people from diverse backgrounds, coming from diverse horizons, with different ideas.

This process is admittedly social, it is not an individual process, it is a process you have to participate in. But now I'm going to tell you about some of the exceptions that I've learned, as well. People will tell you that if you go and talk about things you do not understand to people who do not know you, you will tend to look a little stupid. The objection that I hear a lot is, "But you can look foolish asking questions about fields you do not understand and those people who do not know you." Well, that's true. That's very true. I asked a lot of stupid questions in my life, and you will, too. But the one thing I can tell you is that it's not deadly to ask stupid questions. What's deadly is to not ask the right question at the right time.

The other is that people will also tell you if you talk too much about your ideas, someone will steal them from you. Well, my response to that is that if you have ideas that are so easy to steal, they must not be that good.

In fact, my experience is different. With truly original ideas, the response is that most people don't believe you. One of the three or four things I did in my life that were semi-original were fiercely disbelieved and criticized and initially rejected for both publication and, most importantly, NIH funding, which is the agency that I direct today. So don't despair.

I even carry this 50/50 rule further, because I spent half of my life in our country and half of my life in another country. I don't recommend you push that to that extent.

But, as any rules that you make for young colleagues that you talk to, there are big exceptions. First, this rule doesn't mean that you should develop a split personality. It shouldn't split your integrity. Your integrity has to be constant--100 percent. Another one is that in affairs of love, I don't think you should play the 50/50 rule. That would be deadly, so don't do it.

Last but not least, I would say you should have big dreams, full dreams, not half dreams. You know, it's very simple. You can't put a large box in a small box. Well, you cannot put a full life in a small dream box. What you need is to have a box, a dream box, in a life that is as full as the potential you have today.

For universities and teachers, there's just no greater satisfaction than seeing you graduate and enter your professional calling. I think you have the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between humanity and environment, this century. I think you need to do it.

And you know something? There's nothing greater than coming from a university like MIT to be able to do that. I actually read that if you asked yourself about the 100 governments that existed in 1900, how many of the 100 governments that were active in 1900 are still unchanged today. You know what the answer is? Two. There are only two governments in the world that stayed stable for the past 104 years, the United States and Great Britain. If you ask yourself the question, what about universities? Well, let me ask you. If you took the year 1500, and you took the 100 universities that were active in 1500, how many of them do you think have survived, intact, in 2004? The number is 75 out of 100. So what I can tell you is that universities beat governments hands down. There's no institution that can survive as long as a university if it's cared for by its graduates and alumni. The only institutions that last longer are the institutions of the church.

So I'm sure that MIT will certainly be here at the end of this century and many more centuries to come, thanks to you, as newly minted graduates and future alumni. I understand the Class of 1954 is here, and I want to salute them for coming back to their institution. This is because we're all engaged throughout the world, on the global basis, with a game that has no frontier, a game that has no nationality, and that is to build the fund of knowledge of humanity, to the service of humanity. This was my message. Believe in yourself. Life sciences are a great challenge. We have a lot to do, and I hope you'll join us in this fight. Good luck to you and may God bless you all.

Thank you Mr. President, I had forgotten how crushingly dull these ceremonies are. Thank you.

My best to the choir. I have to say, that song never grows old for me. Whenever I hear that song, it reminds me of nothing.

I am honored to be here, I do have a confession to make before we get going that I should explain very quickly. When I am not on television, this is actually how I dress. I apologize, but there’s something very freeing about it. I congratulate the students for being able to walk even a half a mile in this non-breathable fabric in the Williamsburg heat. I am sure the environment that now exists under your robes, are the same conditions that primordial life began on this earth.

I know there were some parents that were concerned about my speech here tonight, and I want to assure you that you will not hear any language that is not common at, say, a dock workers union meeting, or Tourrett’s convention, or profanity seminar. Rest assured.

I am honored to be here and to receive this honorary doctorate. When I think back to the people that have been in this position before me from Benjamin Franklin to Queen Noor of Jordan, I can’t help but wonder what has happened to this place. Seriously, it saddens me. As a person, I am honored to get it; as an alumnus, I have to say I believe we can do better. And I believe we should. But it has always been a dream of mine to receive a doctorate and to know that today, without putting in any effort, I will. It’s incredibly gratifying. Thank you. That’s very nice of you, I appreciate it.

I’m sure my fellow doctoral graduates—who have spent so long toiling in academia, sinking into debt, sacrificing God knows how many years of what, in truth, is a piece of parchment that in truth has been so devalued by our instant gratification culture as to have been rendered meaningless—will join in congratulating me. Thank you.

But today isn’t about how my presence here devalues this fine institution. It is about you, the graduates. I’m honored to be here to congratulate you today. Today is the day you enter into the real world, and I should give you a few pointers on what it is. It’s actually not that different from the environment here. The biggest difference is you will now be paying for things, and the real world is not surrounded by three-foot brick wall. And the real world is not a restoration. If you see people in the real world making bricks out of straw and water, those people are not colonial re-enactors—they are poor. Help them. And in the real world, there is not as much candle lighting. I don’t really know what it is about this campus and candle lighting, but I wish it would stop. We only have so much wax, people.

Lets talk about the real world for a moment. We had been discussing it earlier, and I…I wanted to bring this up to you earlier about the real world, and this is I guess as good a time as any. I don’t really know to put this, so I’ll be blunt. We broke it.

Please don’t be mad. I know we were supposed to bequeath to the next generation a world better than the one we were handed. So, sorry.

I don’t know if you’ve been following the news lately, but it just kinda got away from us. Somewhere between the gold rush of easy internet profits and an arrogant sense of endless empire, we heard kind of a pinging noise, and uh, then the damn thing just died on us. So I apologize.

But here’s the good news. You fix this thing, you’re the next greatest generation, people. You do this—and I believe you can—you win this war on terror, and Tom Brokaw’s kissing your ass from here to Tikrit, let me tell ya. And even if you don’t, you’re not gonna have much trouble surpassing my generation. If you end up getting your picture taken next to a naked guy pile of enemy prisoners and don’t give the thumbs up you’ve outdid us.

We declared war on terror. We declared war on terror—it’s not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, I’m sure we’ll take on that bastard ennui.

But obviously that’s the world. What about your lives? What piece of wisdom can I impart to you about my journey that will somehow ease your transition from college back to your parents' basement?

I know some of you are nostalgic today and filled with excitement and perhaps uncertainty at what the future holds. I know six of you are trying to figure out how to make a bong out of your caps. I believe you are members of Psi U. Hey that did work, thank you for the reference.

So I thought I’d talk a little bit about my experience here at William and Mary. It was very long ago, and if you had been to William and Mary while I was here and found out that I would be the commencement speaker 20 years later, you would be somewhat surprised, and probably somewhat angry. I came to William and Mary because as a Jewish person I wanted to explore the rich tapestry of Judaica that is Southern Virginia. Imagine my surprise when I realized “The Tribe” was not what I thought it meant.

In 1980 I was 17 years old. When I moved to Williamsburg, my hall was in the basement of Yates, which combined the cheerfulness of a bomb shelter with the prison-like comfort of the group shower. As a freshman I was quite a catch. Less than five feet tall, yet my head is the same size it is now. Didn’t even really look like a head, it looked more like a container for a head. I looked like a Peanuts character. Peanuts characters had terrible acne. But what I lacked in looks I made up for with a repugnant personality.

In 1981 I lost my virginity, only to gain it back again on appeal in 1983. You could say that my one saving grace was academics where I excelled, but I did not.

And yet now I live in the rarified air of celebrity, of mega stardom. My life a series of Hollywood orgies and Kabala center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least that’s what my handlers tell me. I’m actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh.

So I know that the decisions that I made after college worked out. But at the time I didn’t know that they would. See college is not necessarily predictive of your future success. And it’s the kind of thing where the path that I chose obviously wouldn’t work for you. For one, you’re not very funny.

So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You won’t. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience.

I was not exceptional here, and am not now. I was mediocre here. And I’m not saying aim low. Not everybody can wander around in an alcoholic haze and then at 40 just, you know, decide to be president. You’ve got to really work hard to try to…I was actually referring to my father.

When I left William and Mary I was shell-shocked. Because when you’re in college it’s very clear what you have to do to succeed. And I imagine here everybody knows exactly the number of credits they needed to graduate, where they had to buckle down, which introductory psychology class would pad out the schedule. You knew what you had to do to get to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life, is that there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be maddening to those that go here, especially here, because your strength has always been achievement. So if there’s any real advice I can give you it’s this.

College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So don’t worry about your grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strong…although I’m sure downloading illegal files…but, nah, that’s a different story.

Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.

And the last thing I want to address is the idea that somehow this new generation is not as prepared for the sacrifice and the tenacity that will be needed in the difficult times ahead. I have not found this generation to be cynical or apathetic or selfish. They are as strong and as decent as any people that I have met. And I will say this, on my way down here I stopped at Bethesda Naval, and when you talk to the young kids that are there that have just been back from Iraq and Afghanistan, you don’t have the worry about the future that you hear from so many that are not a part of this generation but judging it from above.

And the other thing….that I will say is, when I spoke earlier about the world being broke, I was somewhat being facetious, because every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and life gets better in an instant.

I was in New York on 9-11 when the towers came down. I lived 14 blocks from the twin towers. And when they came down, I thought that the world had ended. And I remember walking around in a daze for weeks. And Mayor Giuliani had said to the city, “You’ve got to get back to normal. We’ve got to show that things can change and get back to what they were.”

And one day I was coming out of my building, and on my stoop, was a man who was crouched over, and he appeared to be in deep thought. And as I got closer to him I realized, he was playing with himself. And that’s when I thought, “You know what, we’re gonna be OK.”

Thank you. Congratulations. I honor you. Good Night.

President Bennet, honored guests, graduates, ladies and gentlemen.

I feel so honored to be here on this special day. I feel even more so for sharing with three other distinguished people the highest honor that an institution of higher learning can confer on an individual. These are occasions that remind us that universities are about relationships that cut across many conceivable boundaries. That I, a South African who is black, a man, a husband and a father; who has interacted, as a teacher, with many students, teachers, and researchers over the years; and who has from time to time reflected on the human condition through the prism of literary art, have been invited to travel to the United States and to accept an honor of this magnitude from Wesleyan University is an affirmation of a universal value often taken for granted. That Wesleyan University affirms this value regularly is a tribute to those who learn here, who teach here, as well as exercise leadership here.

As I bring you greetings from South Africa, and specifically, from my community of scholars and students of the University of Cape Town, I also want to tell you that this year at our campus we celebrate the one hundred and seventy –fifth year of our history. And you can see how far we have come as South Africa’s oldest university.

By a remarkable coincidence, this is the same year in which our country celebrates ten years of democracy. While our country feels new, my university proudly feels somewhat old and hopefully wise and mellow. But we feel so intimidated by the passionate youthfulness of our country that we are doing everything we can to reinvent ourselves, and if we cannot succeed to actually look young, we may at least try to feel so.

I look at more than two hundred years of democracy in the United States and wonder how you feel at this point. Do you feel old and hopefully wise and mellow? Or have you had more than two hundred years of passionate youthfulness? These are not the kind of questions to ask graduating students, who in the glory of their youthfulness, despite being young, are enjoying yet another birth today. Being old is far from their thoughts right now. Yet I’d like to invite you to be old, not in age, but in the ability to stretch the imagination back into history for a brief moment. I’ll tell you why. It’s because I’m fascinated by what ten years of one country and more than two hundred years of another country means, about what could possibly connect them.

Ten years ago my country achieved its freedom from tyranny and oppression. But we did not attain our freedom in the usual way. Our road toward liberty could be described as counterintuitive. This means that in a world that had become conditioned to think of conflict, particularly between black people and white people, as something that ends in victors and the vanquished, of the winner taking it all, it was strange, first, not to have had a racial war. And secondly it was strange that the contending races negotiated themselves out of conflict in favor of an outcome with two victors and no losers. Very strange! What kind of people give up power? And what kind of people give up the possibility of attaining it? What most of us recognized in South Africa, at the very last moment, was just how much we needed one another. We realized that violent confrontation promised only destruction and a long life of shared misery. It was a choice we made. It was a choice against habit, the habit to seek to march into final battle. But there is something deeper about the choice of abandoning habit. It is something we have not reflected on fully in my country.

South Africans have been reflecting on the impact of the past ten years on their lives. Tightly so, they have pointed to achievements that were beyond our imaginations. Within ten years, millions of people have their own houses, clean water, electricity, telephones, and universal early schooling. Major institutions of democracy such as parliament, the constitutional court, and other courts of law are used to resolve disagreement and conflict.While these achievements are real and substantial, the deeper revolution in South Africa is not sufficiently appreciated. It is that we have not explored fully the implications of counterintuitive solution. I like to think of this matter this way: Consider the white leaders who had been telling their followers by word and deed, and through the way they organized society into contrasts of black and white, power and powerlessness, wealth and poverty, division and wealth, that they had a divine right to be superior to other people, only for these leaders to declare almost overnight that this view was wrong all along. How do you turn around in this way and retain credibility? Such leaders faced the fear of loss of credibility, the fear of being thought of as having betrayed their people, of being thought of as having cowardly lost their nerve, and of having become weak at a crucial moment.

Many whites did feel betrayed. Many experienced confusion and tremendous anguish, overnight. We remember one who, in a fit of anger and frustration, took his gun and shot at any black person he came across, killing many. Remarkably many others of his kind recoiled in horror before what they suddenly recognized in themselves.

On the other hand, consider the black leaders, symbolized by Nelson Mandela, who told their followers over decades of struggle that the white man understood only one thing: the language of violence. Freedom would come only at the barrel of a gun. Then one afternoon, on the very day that Nelson Mandela was released and tens of thousands of people waited for him to announce the beginning of a war, he told them instead about responsibility, reminding them about higher goals of freedom. It set conditions for negotiating with the enemy. How do you turn around in this way and retain credibility?

What these events dramatized in an intriguing way was how two camps recognized mutual vulnerability through exposing themselves to considerable risk. In doing so, both sides resisted the attractive habit to be tough. Being tough would have meant going to war at whatever the price. Each would have convinced themselves truth was on their side. But thankfully, our leaders realized that being tough in this kind of way caused much misery in human history. Caught in the clutches of danger, they discovered a new meaning of toughness as something much harder to do. They discovered that being “tough” was not so much about going to war, but about choosing to avoid it.

I believe there have been remarkable benefits from this that were profoundly human. South Africans gave up one-dimensional ways of thinking about one another. They gave up bias, stereotype, and preconception. In giving up historically determined certitudes about themselves and one another, they sought to become far more tolerant, more open-minded, more accepting of personal or group faults. And that for me, has been the greatest South African revolution: the transformation of deeply held personal and group attitudes and beliefs.

Perhaps to get a sense of just how far we have come, let us recall what it was like living in South Africa just before we gave up war and violence as a solution to our problems. We remember how arrogant and self-righteous white society and the apartheid government were in those days, and how those attributes of behavior made them blind to their cruelty and the extent of it. They projected invincibility, as if things would be the way they wanted them to be to the end of time. The South African sun, they said, would never set. Being the most powerful military machine in South Africa, they had terrorized the entire subcontinent to submission. Their military capability had far outstripped their capacity to make it accountable to a higher moral order. The value of their humanity and their identity as a people became inseparable from, and even reducible to, their weapons of war. They had become a manipulative state, obsessed with the mechanisms of its own survival.

They had this sense that they could stand up to the whole world, defy global opinion, and do whatever they liked in the pursuit and promotion of their self-interest. In this they subjected their own citizens to the kind of constant brutality they meted out to others. In dealing with those they regarded as of lesser human quality than themselves, they were accountable to no higher morality. I remember that far from earning my respect, I deeply feared them. But it was a fear that went with much loathing. It all seems like a bad dream now. Within a short space of time, the false sense of invincibility gave way to a deeply liberating sense of vulnerability and even humility. That was one of the defining moments of our transformation: this embracing of uncertainty and vulnerability, which at the same time went with the certitude that the past was unsustainable. I have reflected much on this. What seems to happen in this situation is that at the point at which you recognize mutual vulnerability between yourself and an adversary that won’t go away, you signal a preparedness to recognize that there might be new grounds for a common humanity whose promise lies in the real possibility that you may have to give up something of what has defined your reality, handed down from a past that cannot entirely meet your best interests now and in the future. It is the humility that arises when you give up certitudes around what was previously the uncontested terrain of your value system and unsustainable positions derived from it.

It is a delicate psychology that is at play here. Its full potential is possible only through a newly discovered foundation of trust. It is about how to reconstitute identity, meaning, and credibility during that fragile moment when you and your adversary are both in danger of losing them all. It is about recognizing that both of you are caught in a situation of profound need for each other. But it is never easy to reach such a position, and if it can be so difficult for individuals, consider how difficult it must be for entire nations. Few are the moments in history when nations were in a position to accept that they could be wrong that a value system that stood them so well through centuries may no longer be sustainable. In this, nations would rather go to war and be humiliated by unintended outcomes that showed them just how much they ignored an inner voice of  caution, or the pride that forced them to ignore it.

These reflections are from my challenge to our graduation class to stretch their imagination back into history to try to find what could possibly connect a ten-year democracy with one that is more than two hundred years old. Well, what is this connection?We still recall with excitement in South Africa the pains, traumas, and finally the pleasures of giving up a past. I believe that for you in the United States, the connection is your capacity to recall how exciting it was to do so more than two hundred years ago. Where do you sense yourself to be at this juncture in this world that all of us live in? Is there reason to contemplate another birth? Is there need for some great leap to be taken? One of the greatest fears of political leadership is the fear of losing it. The question is, has the fear become so inordinate that it has become a real threat to the future?

So much has happened to you since 9/11, when the world was truly in solidarity with you. I wrote to my friends all over the United States, telling them how much I suffered with them. Since then, I experience the world with increasing fear. I see the world becoming more and more divided. I sense that the situation we are in from a global perspective is not fundamentally different from where my country was ten years ago. I sense that the world needs a leading nation, or group of nations, that can reassure, inspire hope, and offer fresh perspectives and new directions. I ask myself what nation or nations could possibly do that, I do not have an unambiguous answer. One moment I know it, the next moment I don’t. 

Of one thing I am certain, though: The evolution of global awareness has led us to yearn for a world that needs to value highly multiple visions of itself. We need leadership to get us there. Where will it come from? One thing is certain also: War and conquests in the twenty-first century suddenly look distressingly primitive as instruments for conducting the affairs of the world, no matter how advanced the weapons of war. We need a new value system for resolving world conflicts. In that value system the mechanisms for the resolution of conflicts and disputes would be founded on the principle that it is possible and even desirable to achieve mutually affirming solutions, to have mutually respectful victors and no losers. The value system based on the single, predetermined solutions, often one that is imposed by force of arms, will not result in mutually affirming outcomes, but can generate powerful human emotions that lead to perpetual global dissonance, anxiety, fear, and despair. Now, I do have faith in the power of humanity to reinvent itself. In this, every graduation offers that possibility. That is why I am so happy for you, Class of 2004, who are moving out into the world, confident that you will contribute to societal renewal through your infectious enthusiasm and zest for life.

Mr President, thank you and your great university for honoring me so much, and for giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts that have preoccupied me. May Wesleyan University continue to bring out young people who can think about their world in a new way. I hope that my country and yours can play a vital role in facing the challenge to renew a world which sends out many messages to us about just how much we need one another. We can no longer afford to be blind in continuing to ignore these messages.

When I direct actors, I often try to put them in a place where they have no control, where they are most scared and have to experience themselves naked, in the moment, only able to cope with what is. And when it happens, and they realize they're not going to die from it, the experience is a high. It’s a re-affirmation of faith. A connection with something larger than themselves to which they concede all control. And this 'connection' with something larger is what one might call 'being creative.' Whether it is acting, painting a sunset, telling a story, inventing a new piece of software, selling a new line of dresses, discovering a cure, healing a patient or affecting a dialogue between mortal enemies, ... it is what we, as human beings, are all about. We live to commune. We live to create. Our enduring biological and spiritual drive is to create, to live in the act of becoming. It is not a choice. It is not something over which we have any control. It is our experience of our existence. Our choice is what we do with our minds, what we do with our fear.

It is said that only those that have experienced their own mortality through the loss of a loved one or a near death experience of their own can know that choice, because that is the greatest experience of our fear of helplessness; our mortality. I would venture to say that, while we may go to great lengths to deny it, we are quickly approaching a time when this fear, this extreme helplessness.. is showing itself in more and more ways as it bubbles, roils beneath a surface that we are ever determined to keep calm, controlled, and in place. Our fear is an anathema to us, and we go to great lengths to avoid it… to the detriment of our creativity, of our very act of being, and we sacrifice our ability to search, and in the accepting the security of the status-quo, to re -- search, to re--discover, to re -- attach to that body of knowledge of which we are all a part. To re-member, that which we all know and knew at the moment of our birth. We sacrifice our experience of ourselves to be created, and to be creative. And in the name of security we make choices away from our hearts, away from our real needs as individuals, and as a civilization

The great Masters ... Jesus, Buddha, Muhammed, and others studied and spoke to this fear. They spoke to this fear of our mortality and our seeming powerlessness to do anything about it, powerlessness to affect the inevitability of our animal selves. They studied and taught that our fear is not our enemy, not something to be avoided at all costs, contrary to the romantic notion that " There is nothing to fear but fear itself." That when we experience our fear, when we say the words ... "I am scared," we have the choice, the ability to acknowledge that being 'scared' is not who we are. It is not our identity. And while there is a part of us that is scared, there's also a part of us that isn't scared. That we can choose to identify the location and parameters of our fear as well as those parts of us that are not experiencing the fear. I feel fear in my belly, or my chest, or my throat, ... but right then, I do not experience it at the top of my head, in my little finger, at my elbow. How is that? And where am I making this observation from? What part of me is able to see my pain, my fear as something apart? See my fear as something apart? Is that part of me the same part that allows each one of us, as if suspended in the air and looking down from above, to see ourselves, me see myself standing here, talking, you see yourselves sitting there, listening, bored, confused, .. it’s a long morning and I know you want to get out of here… Is that the same part that's able to watch ourselves think and feel? Is that place, from which I am seeing all of this, is that who I really am: my awareness, my consciousness, my knowing place that is a part of all knowing, ... to which we are all a part of?

And when we are able acknowledge this , see our fear and pain from this place apart, to not say "I am scared" as if that was who I was, we then have the opportunity to say: " Boy, this is really difficult being a human being. Difficult knowing at a cellular level, a biological level that once conceived, our clock is ticking, our dying has begun, and we have no control over that." And from this witnessing place in us, we have the opportunity to watch our egos, our minds, whirring and burning in an effort to create some illusion that we do have some control, some power. We have the opportunity to see how our minds create belief systems, illusions of ownership, judgments of what is good, bad, false, true, beautiful, ugly ... AND that none of it changes the basic truth of the death of our lives in the constancy of change. And in that opportunity to witness our plight as human beings in the presence of our fear, our mortality, we can choose to hate ourselves, or to love ourselves. We can choose to feel compassion for ourselves. And when we choose compassion for ourselves, we can find compassion for others. And at that moment, we can know in our hearts, in our beings that we all indeed, are one. What the Masters learned and practiced is that it is necessary to know our fear, to acknowledge, sit with our fear, in order to know our hearts. That our acknowledgement of our fear is the path to our compassion, the path to our capacity for love. We need our fear, ... ..in order to find our love. They go together. Ying and Yang.

We live our lives to die. With each exhalation. Each letting go. Each moment of release, ... we seek, as lemmings to the sea, to die into the 'one,' into the 'all,' the 'everything' of existence. We practice this in the way of our lives. We worship it in our heroes, who, in the face of great adversity and symbolic or very real death, are able to stay present, acknowledge their fear, and from that place of awareness, of consciousness, are able to achieve heroic results. We rejoice in it when we stand with our hero to home plate, bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, score tied, two outs, last game of the world series and he hits a home-run. We rejoice in it in the well hit golf ball or tennis ball. In the transcendence of a performance, a great discovery, a heroic sacrifice, in the birthing of a child, in the communion with anything or any body that gives us our sense of being one. Of belonging. We seek and search to surrender to a higher ground, ... a place of peace and oneness. A state of being that is change, where we get to visit, pass through, pass from, and let go of.

Today is but a moment along the way of your journey, of your children's journey. The level of opportunity for compassion, for love, for the human-ness of our beings to evolve past our animal selves, is commensurate with the amount of fear, hate and destruction we are experiencing on this planet. You can and will be cowed by it. It will constantly infect your lives, try to beat you into apathy and cynicism, threaten to trample your hopes and dreams into regrets and self recriminations. It will want to seduce you into hate and anger, and impatience and intolerance, harden you into judgment. It will not deprive you of your God given right to choose. Your divine right to gain strength and succor from the innate knowledge that we belong to each other, to the one, to all. That there is an irrefutable truth to our existence proved by our ability and choice to acknowledge our consciousness. This is your inheritance. This is what all the lives that have come before you have given you. This is what you can give to your children. To the world. To the universe. That you have the choice of consciousness. You have the choice to practice that choice. 

In closing, I would like to share a favorite poem of mine that I suspect many of you are already familiar with. To me, it's beauty that…. continues to reverberate in me, in the years after I first read it.

Two roads diverged in a wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And perhaps having the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Before I begin my talk today, I'd like to step out of my role as Commencement speaker and Colby faculty member and speak for a moment as a Colby parent. As most of you know, one member of the class of 2004, Dawn Rossignol, is not here today. Her family has been living every parent's worst nightmare since her tragic, senseless loss last autumn. This day, so full and pride and joy for us, must be particularly difficult for them, and our hearts go out to those good people.

A couple years ago I was talking to a man whose son had graduated the year before from Stanford University. He was proud of the boy, who'd done well there, and proud too that his son had received the kind of education he himself had never dreamed of. But he had misgivings as well. I could tell he had something on his mind that I, as a former college professor, might be able to help him understand. It took him a while, but he finally came to the point, which was, "Why do you have to mess with them?"

"Mess with them," I repeated.

"Right," he said. "I sent my son off to Stanford a good Republican, and four years later he comes home and tells me he's voting Democratic. You should hear some of the things he says."

"Well, he learned to think," I explained. "If it makes you feel any better, I sent my daughter off to Colby College a good liberal, and by the end of her junior year she was dating the president of the College Republicans."

"Let's swap kids," he suggested. "Yours got smart."

"Not on your life," I told him, though I knew his son well and was fond of him. "What happened," I went on, "was supposed to happen. I mean, think about it. It cost you 35,000 dollars a year for four years at Stanford. That's 140,000 dollars. The kid thought just like you before he left. If he came back thinking like you, you'd have done better to put the money in your pocket and lock the kid in the house."

But he was not convinced. He still wanted to swap kids, I could tell. Weirdly, the whole conversation was vaguely familiar, and after a while remembered why. In a novel of mine called Straight Man, a professor named William Henry Devereaux Jr. remarks that it is the vain hope of middle class parents that their children will go off to college and later be returned to them economically viable but otherwise unchanged. Hank understands what many parents never quite seem to grasp—that sending their kids off to college is a lot like putting them in the witness protection program. If the person who comes out is easily recognizable as the same person who went in, something has gone terribly, dangerously wrong. Indeed, these young men and women we're returning to you today have been so thoroughly messed with (not to say messed up) you may not recognize them, especially dressed as they are. On behalf of Colby's faculty, I'm pleased to report that it's been fun making their heads spin these last four years. For the most part we're rather pleased with the results, and we hope you will be too.

But here I am talking to your parents instead of you, the class of 2004. I can tell you can't wait to hear what I have to say and for it to be over, so I'll try to be brief. In my 54 years I've learned very little that I can pass on to you with confidence, so brevity shouldn't be a problem. Virtually nothing in my life has gone according to plan, and that's the good news, because I'd have settled for far less than I've been blessed with at every turn. With that in mind I have two things to offer today: first, a story, and second, some advice about the rest of your lives. If you're only able to pay attention to one, listen to the story, because I am by profession a storyteller. I've come to a point in my life where I think almost exclusively in narrative, and as my own fiction writing students this semester can attest, about the only reliable advice I have to give is on how to make stories more plausible, more moving, more true—in other words, how to lie better. On life, I'm not so reliable.

Anyway, the story. About ten years ago I was teaching at a large Midwestern university while I waited for the opportunity to teach at a small, eastern liberal arts college, which came in due course. One Friday night my wife and I went to a party given by one of my graduate students in a house that, if it had been a car, would have been a Studebaker up on blocks. The keg had run dry half an hour earlier, a collection had been taken up to buy another, and it had only just dawned on the people at the party that nobody knew the guy who'd volunteered to go get it. In the living room the rickety furniture had been moved out onto the porch to create a dance floor, and Grace Slick was singing "Somebody to Love," a song I've never been able to resist, especially when the volume on the stereo is set on stun, as it happened just then to be. "When the truth is found to be lies," Grace wanted us to understand, "you know the joy within you dies."

Across the room, dancing with a kind of free-spirited abandon that I happened just then to admire, was a good-looking young professor of religious studies with whom I'd had a couple of run-ins and never particularly cared for, though she was far too attractive to dislike entirely. She approached life, it seemed to me, with the kind of bitter cynicism that I associate with academics who have come to believe, rightly or wrongly, that they will not be granted tenure. Is it even necessary to add that she lacked a sense of humor? Anyway, at the moment, the young religious studies professor's face was lit up from the inside with something I'd never witnessed before—joy, unless I was mistaken—which made me wonder if I'd misjudged her. I hope this might be true. Did I say she was attractive?

It was maybe an hour later when we professors, perspiring and red-faced from our exertions, and unused to being up after ten o'clock, began to take our leave, so that our grad students could begin the real party. My wife and I left through the kitchen so we could thank our hostess, and there we encountered an intimate and utterly unexpected scene. The professor of religious studies was sitting at the kitchen table, her head in her hands, sobbing pitifully, over and over again, "All I ever wanted was to sing a little rock and roll." Staring at the chipped, beer-soaked Formica tabletop, she'd had a revelation, you could tell. Thanks to Grace Slick she was beginning to see her life in a whole new way. To this point she'd imagined that her problem was that she wasn't going to get tenure, whereas she now saw, to her complete horror, that of course she would. Whatever had lit her face on the dance floor had been extinguished, and it was hard to imagine it would be rekindled any time soon. In this, her moment of terrible truth, I found myself liking her better than I ever had before, though, with her defenses down, she wasn't nearly so good-looking. Seeing her sitting there, so despondent, you could imagine the effort it took to present herself to the world each morning.

I don't tell you this story today in order to encourage all of you in the class of '04 to find careers in the music business, but rather to suggest what the next decade of your lives is likely to be about, and that is, trying to ensure that you don't wake up at 32 or 35 or 40 tenured to a life that happened to you when you weren't paying strict attention, either because the money was good, or it made your parents proud, or because you were unlucky enough to discover an aptitude for the very thing that bores you to tears, or for any of the other semi-valid reasons people marshal to justify allowing the true passion of their lives to leak away. If you're lucky, you may have more than one chance to get things right, but second and third chances, like second and third marriages, can be dicey propositions, and they don't come with guarantees. This much seems undeniable. When the truth is found to be lies, you're still screwed, even if you’re tenured in religious studies.

The question then is this: How does a person keep from living the wrong life? Well, here are Russo's Rules For A Good Life. Notice that I don't say "for a happy life." One of the reasons the novelist Graham Greene despised Americans was that phrase "the pursuit of happiness," which we hold so dear and which ensured, to his way of thinking, we'd always be an infantile nation. Better to live a good life, he believed, than a happy one. Happily, the two may not always be mutually exclusive. Keep in mind that Russo's Rules for a Good Life are specifically designed to be jettisoned without regret when they don't work. They've worked for me. Your mileage may vary.

Rule # 1: Search out the kind of work that you would gladly do for free and then get somebody to pay you for it. Don't expect this to happen overnight. It took me nearly twenty years to get people to pay me a living wage for my writing, which makes me, even at this juncture, one of the fortunate few. Your work should be something that satisfies, excites and rewards you, something that gives your life meaning and direction, that stays fresh and new and challenging, a task you'll never quite master, that will never be completed. It should be the kind of work that constantly humbles you, that never allows you to become smug—in short, work that sustains you instead of just paying your bills. While you search for this work, you'll need a job. For me that job was teaching, and it's a fine thing to be good at your job, as long as you don't confuse it with your work, which it's hard not to do.

Rule # 2: Find a loving mate to share what life has in store, because the world can be a lonely place, and people who aren't lonely don't want to hear about it if you are. At some point you're going to tire of yourself, of the sound of your own voice (if you haven't already), and you're going to need someone whose voice you never tire of, someone who'll know you better, in some ways, than you know yourself and who'll remind you who you are when you forget and why things matter. After thirty years, my wife Barbara and I continue to delight in each other's company, and that's astonishing given the number of other people we've grown weary of. I have to tell you that the odds of finding the right person to spend an entire life with are not great, and if you get it wrong, badly wrong, your good life will morph in abject misery. In which case, go back to Rule # 1 and concentrate on your work. Maybe she'll go away. Or he.Rule # 3: have children. After what you've put your parents through, you deserve children of your own. Next time you're back home, get out the old photo albums and take a good look at some pictures of your parents when they were your age. Talk about the witness protection program. But don't let these snapshots of your parents when they were happy and carefree dissuade you. Have kids. Don't worry that you can't afford them, though it's true, you can't. Don't worry too much about the world they'll be born into, which will suck, because that's what the world mostly does. You won't be a fully vested citizen until you have someone you love more than life to hand this imperfect world over to. And don't worry that you may have poor parenting skills, which you will. Just remember this: everything you say and do from the time your children are born until the day they move out of the house should be motivated by the terrible possibility that your son or daughter could turn out to be a writer, a writer with only one reliable subject: You. When my father, whom I loved dearly, died over a decade ago, I'm sure he rested easy in the belief that most of the evidence had died with him. There was no way he could have predicted that there would one day be over a half a million copies of The Risk Pool and Nobody's Fool floating around, not to mention a major motion picture. Had this possibility occurred to him, I can't help thinking he'd have done one or two things differently. So, as Carrnela Soprano says, "Watch your step." But by all means have children. No one was more aware of the danger inherent in reproduction than I, and I have two beloved daughters, one of whom graduates here today. They are the pride and joy of my life, and neither of them would ever, ever write about their father, would you, Kate?

Rule # 4. If you have one, nurture your sense of humor. You're going to need it, because, as Bob Dylan has observed, "people are crazy, the times are strange." Just as importantly, remember that in an age as numbingly earnest as this one, where we're more often urged to be sensitive than just, where genuinely independent thought is equally unwelcome to fundamentalists on both the left and right, it's laughter that keeps us sane. Indeed, the inability to laugh, at the world and at ourselves, is a sign, at least to my way of thinking, of mental illness. Mark Twain, overcome by loss and bitterness and despair near the end of his life, stopped laughing, but he never stopped believing in the power of laughter. The angel Satan in "The Mysterious Stranger" fragments, which were among the last things he ever wrote, reminds humans that, "Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand. You [humans] are always fussing and fighting with your other weapons. Do you ever use that one? No, you leave it rusting... you lack sense and courage." Or, as critic Kathleen Powers puts it, "We Americans worry about humor, confusing it with a lack of seriousness. [But] Look here. Along with art and immorality, it is humor that distinguishes human beings from animals. It is, furthermore, a truly civilizing force, nemesis to the big battalions, and a vexation and puzzlement to the purveyors of mediocrity." And speaking of the big battalions and lethal mediocrity, keep in mind that we are unlikely to vote anyone out of public office who hasn't first been the subject of private hilarity.

Okay, that's pretty much it. It’s all I know, and then some. Four simple, deeply flawed rules to live by. Go to it. Be bold. Be true. Be kind. Rotate your tires. Don't drink so much. There aren't going to be enough liver transplants to go around.

Good luck!

President Painter, honored guests, including my good friend Ray Joslin, faculty members, families and most especially, all of you brand new graduates out there, I want to thank you for allowing me to share this momentous day with you. I’ve spoken at Trinity College twice before but it is an even greater honor to be back on your beautiful campus for this significant event in your lives.

I am especially pleased that along with all of you, I, too, am receiving a degree today. I will treasure this one and I want to tell you a bit about myself so that you’ll understand why I put so much value in academic degrees. As you might expect the degrees I most value are the ones I earned through years of hard work, and especially my doctorate in education from Columbia Teachers College. When I received that degree I was absolutely beaming. But to fully appreciate why I felt so good, I have to take you back to when I was a little girl.

I grew up in Frankfurt, Germany in a loving family of orthodox Jews. When I was ten, my family put me on a special train, along with 300 other children, bound for Switzerland. We were being sent to a boarding school to escape the Nazis. Almost of us became orphans while we were in that school, including me.

When I was in Switzerland, I often dreamed of the day when I would earn a degree. But in that school I wasn’t allowed to study book learning. The German boys were, but we girls had to study housekeeping. And so my first degree, from that school in Heiden when I was 16, was as a Swiss housekeeper. Now you may know that the Swiss consider themselves to be very neat and clean, so they probably thought that we German girls should be honored to be good enough to be conferred with a degree in Swiss housekeeping. But while I was certainly thankful to the Swiss for having kept me safe through the war, I confess that I was less than thrilled with the education that they had provided me.

Cleaning bathtubs and toilets was not a skill that I thought one needed to go to school to learn. That is why I never had my degree framed to put up on the wall, though I still have it as a reminder of those days. And while such a degree could be thought of as more practical than, say, a degree in philosophy, if you ask my children, they’ll tell you that I must have forgotten much of what I was taught because when they were growing up the last thing they ever thought of me was as a good housekeeper. And you don’t need to be a student of Sigmund Freud to figure out why I continue to prefer that my house be on the messy side rather than neat enough to please a Swiss hausfrau.

And now that you’ve heard this story, you don’t have to have taken Psychology 101 to figure out why I place such a high importance on education. I’m sure that before the rise of the Nazis there were days I didn’t want to go to school or nights when I balked at doing my homework. But once someone tells you that you can’t do something, that your school has been closed just because it was for Jewish children, or that you can’t study math and history just because you are a female, then that changes your perspective. That makes you want that thing, whatever it is, more than ever. And so for me, that doctorate in the interdisciplinary study of the family was worth more than gold or diamonds. The Nazis hadn’t wanted me to live. The Swiss hadn’t wanted me to get a higher education. No wonder then, that when that doctorate in education was placed into my hand it made me feel ten feet tall. And while to most people ten feet tall is an expression, for me it’s more than twice my height!

Of course most of you didn’t face such obstacles in getting your degree. But that shouldn’t make you any less proud. You still worked very hard. You are just fortunate that you live in the United States where people have the freedom to succeed no matter what their religion, ethnicity or height. Instead it’s the world that should be ashamed that there are still places on this planet where people don’t have such freedoms. When speaking about the Holocaust, we Jews say “Never Again” but while it hasn’t happened to us again, it is still happening to others. To name one, in the Sudan nearly a million refugees are being forced to flee for their lives merely because of the color of their skin.

I am not going to suggest to you today that you all rush out and try to fix the entire world. We can all do more but we can only do so much. But the reason I think a story like mine is important for young people like you to hear is that you never know when life is going to throw you a curve of one sort or another. Before the rise of the Nazis I had a wonderful childhood. I didn’t know what was in store for me. I took those days for granted. So the biggest mistake you can make is to be complacent and think that you have lots of extra time on your hands. You might, but you also might not. A crisis could hit you at any moment.

And so, if there is one lesson you should learn today, it’s not to waste one precious second of your life. You should never say “I’m bored” or “I’m tired” or “there’s nothing to do.” There’s so much to do that you can’t possibly let one second slip by that’s not filled to the brim. For example, there are something like 130,000 books published in this country every single year. They might not all be worth reading, but let’s face it, you’re not even going to make a dent in such a pile. Or if you look at the newspaper there’s always a concert or a play or a movie to go to. And there are museums filled with exhibits. And a whole world of wonders to visit. And there are friends and family to see. Sporting events to take part in. Fabulous foods to taste. Delicious wines to sip. And, in my special arena, great moments to share with a partner.

Another lesson that you can perhaps pull from my story is that it is never too late to start something new. I started out as a kindergarten teacher, in both Israel and Paris, France.

After studying at the Sorbonne, the New School for Social research in New York and getting that hard-earned doctorate, I went on to become a college professor. But after losing a job due to budgetary cutbacks, I spent some time working with Planned Parenthood. As a result I came to the realization that teaching people about sex was a very important field. And so, I went back to school, at Cornell Medical School, to study to become a sex therapist. I also later taught there, as well as opened my own private practice. At one point the opportunity came along to go on a radio program and talk frankly about sex, which nobody else had ever done before. By accepting that challenge, I ended up going from being an unknown college professor to becoming the world-famous Dr. Ruth, whose books have been translated in as many as 23 languages, all because I was willing to say orgasm, penis and vagina on radio, as well as on campuses like Princeton, Yale, Notre Dame and Trinity. But by that time I was in my mid-50’s. So you see, no matter what degree you are receiving today, it doesn’t lock you into any one path. If you feel like trying your hand at something else, I say go ahead and take a chance.

My favorite animal is the turtle. The reason is that in order for the turtle to move, it has to stick its neck out. There are going to be times in your life when you’re going to have to stick your neck out. There will be challenges and instead of hiding in a shell, you have to go out and meet them. I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the Jewish word chutzpah, but it’s a word you should familiarize yourself with. To live life at its fullest you have to have the chutzpah to accept challenges. You don’t need nerves of steel. I’m not saying that sometimes you won’t be shaking in your boots after accepting some major challenge. But you can’t let that stop you. It really is better to fail than not to try, because if you never try, you’ll never succeed, and as bad as failure feels, success feels so much better.

Let me give you another example. When I get off this podium today, I’m heading back to Manhattan where I’m hosting a concert at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. Playing are an Israeli cellist, who is a friend of mine, and an Israeli-Arab pianist. I had already made the plans for this concert when I was asked to give this address. I could have said no to Trinity. I could have said, “it’s crazy to try to cram so much into one day. Trinity will get another speaker. I can do it another year.” I could have said to myself, “Ruth, you’re 75 years old, soon to be 76, it’s time to take it easy, so say ‘No, thank you.’” But you know what? I didn’t spend more than a split second thinking about it. In typical Westheimer fashion, as I call it, I called Trinity back and said of course I’ll be there. I knew there’d be a way to do both. And maybe the chance to get a degree from Trinity wouldn’t come again. Certainly I’d never get the opportunity to speak to this particular class again. You’re going off to start new lives and who knows when our paths will cross again.

So I wanted to be here for you. I wanted to be able to say the things I’ve said to you here today so that if at some time down the road you reach a crossroads, if you’re at a point where you need to make a decision whether to say yes or no, hopefully at that moment you’ll think back to your commencement day. You’ll think of little Dr. Ruth and what she managed to accomplish, even rather late in life, and you’ll say to yourself, you know, I’m not going to be afraid of a little work, or a little challenge. I’m not going to take the easy way out. I won’t be satisfied with accepting what other people are willing to offer me. I’m not going to waste my time here on earth, but instead I’m going to make the most of it. If 4’7” Dr. Ruth could change the world, even a little bit, then I can too.

Now, if only one of you does that sometime in the next 25 years, then that will have made my trip here worthwhile. And if it happens to two of you, then I’ll be really honored. Because I didn’t come here to get a degree but to make a difference - a difference in the lives of a group of young people who will be inheriting the world. It’s a big responsibility, but believe me, not too big if you leave here with the right attitude.

Shalom. 

Thank you very much. I tell you, there is nowhere I’d rather be on a day like this but around all of this electrical equipment.Good afternoon, distinguished academics. My name is Seth MacFarlane, and for those of you who recognize me, I’d like to say: Mom, Dad, Paris, thanks for coming but please wait in the car.

Now I know that many of you know me only for my voice, and it may be a bit jarring to see me speak in person. You’re thinking to yourself: “Boy, it’s strange to hear that voice coming out of that face,” you’re thinking to yourselves. In that sense, I’m a lot like Celine Dion. I’m not calling her silly-looking but if you meet her in person, I’ll give you a dollar if you can find her nose.

To tell the truth, I don’t know why you guys invited me. I mean, this is Harvard. This is the most prestigious college in the world. I went to the Rhode Island School of Design: an art school whose only athletic institution is a hockey team called the Nads and the mascot is a giant penis named Scrotie. Go to a game; I swear I’m not making that up. Harvard has created brilliant throngs of brilliant doctors, lawyers, authors, scientists; I created a TV show where a vaudeville-era barbershop quartet sings a song about AIDS. Your grandchildren will boast impressive salaries and trust funds. My grandchildren will owe money to the FCC.

But one thing we do have in common is the glittering jewel that is New England. Like many of you, I hail from this great region, Connecticut, to be precise and while I treasure my formative years in the land of chowd-ah, lobst-ah, and gonorrhe-ah, boy, that’s two STD jokes in the first five minutes, I should’ve proofread this thing. I’m here to tell you about the place I live in now: the real world.

There’s no dress rehearsal, no take-home tests, no rough drafts. If you unconstitutionally wiretap people’s phones, you’ll be taken down. If you shoot someone in the face with a shotgun, you’ll reap the consequences. If you illegally invade a sovereign nation to secure oil interests and assuage a personal vendetta, you’ll be re-elected.

But I’m not here to bludgeon you with my political beliefs; I’m not here to slam current, former, and undeserving celebrities. No, I’m here because I have great love and respect for this fine establishment. You see, it was always a fantasy — no, a fetish — of mine to be a Harvard student. So, for the last four years, I have secretly been living amongst you: eating in your dining halls, attending your classes, sleeping with your women and in a tragic case of miscommunication, sleeping with Lawrence Summers. Although, God bless him, the man has the hands of a prison doctor.

And what I’ve learned from my undercover expedition into your tributary civilization of advanced physics, law, biology, business, economics, and weed, I know, it seems off that that would be a major, but it’s actually very

interesting. Classes are held at Cabot House.

What I’ve learned is that you like Family Guy. So I could stand up here and drone on for the next 15 minutes, but I know that’s not what you want. You’re like my mother in that you don’t want to hear from me. You just want to hear the voices. So I’d like to turn things over to my colleague from TV Land, to offer you his perspective on

your progress.

PETER GRIFFIN: Greetings, citizens of Harvard. As I look out on this sea of black Asian faces, I think to myself one thought: “Take that, Hitler” because we won. Yeah!

Harvard is pound-for-pound the smartest of all your freaking schools. In fact, I hope one day my son Chris will go to Harvard. Okay, I’m just jacking myself off there, but maybe one of my kids, I mean, Meg’s got the look of a Harvard gal but I’m not sure she’s got the brains going on. She’d probably do better at one of those real lesbian colleges like Smith or Yale.

Now I know some of you stuffier types are probably thinking: Who the hell does Peter Griffin think he is, preaching to us? He didn’t even finish college. Well, I can drink a case of Budweiser in 10 minutes flat, so stuff it up your Dockers, Mr. Wadsworth Douchington V.

But the rest of you seem like stand-up guys and girls and tomorrow, you smart kids are going to be sitting there in your cool caps and gowns, looking like that owl on the Wise potato chip bags. I see you out there, thinking, ponderig’, pontificating, using words like “subterfuge,” “fuselage,” and “MSNBC.” You remind me of the many smart young people I know: DoogieHowser, Malcolm in the Middle, and Donatello of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and we need more smart people like you. You know? I mean, I get into my car every morning and I think: “How does my car work? What makes it move? I get in this thing and it just goes? How the hell does that happen? I don’t understand but you guys do and for that, I walk in your fucking shadow.

The next wave of great inventions is going to come from you guys. I mean, how many times have you said, “I’d like some cheese right now.” And before smart people came along, you had to wait for a cow to die and rot in the sun or something. But now? Bam! Aerosol cheese. Cheese that sprays out of, like, a paint can. You know? Whoever invented spray cheese had to have been a Harvard guy. Or let’s say you see a commercial for one of them Soloflex things, and you want to order one so you can get in shape even though everybody says you got to be gay to have a Soloflex, but I don’t think you got to be gay to have a Soloflex. So you run to get a pencil to write down that phone number, and you trip and fall and hurt your knee. Well, before smart people came along, you had to sit there in pain just going (inhale) AAHHHH! (inhale) AAHHHH! But now? Band-Aids, had to be a Harvard guyYou know, I never stood in front of so many smart people before. Who knows? Sitting out there in that audience may be a future President of the United States. And when he’s elected, you’ll say, “THAT guy?? Barry?? The guy who walked down the hallway freshman year with his nuts hanging out? HE’S the President now?? The guy who crapped his pants at the Fly Club? And he didn’t even go home after that? He sat there and had four more beers and then he went home with that chick from Amherst? That guy whopassed out in the showers and then we wrote all over him with Magic Marker? And he walked around for two days with the faded word “douchebag” written on his forehead, and he had no idea? I used to pee in that guy’s shampoo bottle! And now he’s president? The American people just elected President Pee Head?”

But at least you guys will have the goods on him. You can call him and say, “Hey President Pee Head, I peed in your shampoo, so make me Secretary of something.” And it’ll turn out that peeing in some guy’s shampoo bottle was the best career move you ever made. That’s how life works sometimes. I like to think there are no dumb ideas.

But listen, as smart as you kids are, you don’t get too high and mighty, because I happen to know a certain sandy-haired janitor who’s smarter than all of you put together. That’s right. The guy who solved that math problem was a janitor. And we all know what that got him: a date with Minnie Driver and that big Easter Island head of hers. Yeah, Minnie, I said it. Let me put it this way: You like apples? Well, your face is freakishly big for your head, so how do you like those apples? Man, that movie sucked.

So, I know most of you will be shipping off to fight the war in Iraq, and others will be doing missionary work in Africa, but remember, some of you, that Wall Street is still an option. Don’t rule it out, because it’s a noble profession. Goldman Sachs needs people, too.

And here’s a tip for you: Digital. Just think about that. The future is going digital. I don’t know what that means, but just remember who told that to you.

Well, that’s about it for me, I got to run; TBS is showing that episode of Different Strokes where Arnold and Dudley get inappropriately touched by the guy from WKRP in Cincinnati. So, I’m going to pass it over to Stewie, but let me leave you with piece of advice: it’s a very simple piece of advice, and each person here will interpret it in their own way. And it is this: “Hehehehehehehe.” Good day to you.

STEWIE: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is indeed an honor to address the denizens of the hallowed grounds of Harvard: where boys can be boys, girls can be girls, and those in between can create student groups to feel better about their lack of romantic options.

So, it’s one day before graduation. That’s one more night to get that roommate to kill himself so you can get straight A’s. You might want to remind him how he never got laid, and how these were the best years. Tap him on the shoulder and remind him that his parents didn’t come today, and if worse comes to worst, push him out the goddamn window.

Now, I may not be the hippest cat in the world, but I do know something about the way you college students think. And I know who your heroes are. And at the top of that list is a fellow whom you regard as the very epitome of the cutting edge of “cool.” The trends that he sets, you follow without question. And when he opens his mouth, you young people take it as gospel. Of course, I’m talking about your precious paragon of current popular culture: the Fonz.

Well, let me tell you this: he doesn’t know everything. He drives a motorcycle, which is incredibly dangerous, he wears his trousers too tight, which inhibits sperm production, and friends, if you hit a jukebox with your fist, you’re just going to break it.

So, suffice it to say, I know how your minds work. And I know what you’re thinking on this day of your advancement into adulthood. You’re wondering to yourselves, “What can I expect from the outside world? Will I find my niche? What should I know about the vast territory that lies beyond the confines of my little subculture of textbooks, ramen noodles, coin-operated laundry, and TV shows that seem to think they can skate by with random jokes about giant chickens that have absolutely nothing to do with the overall narrative?” The boys at South Park are absolutely correct. Those cutaways and flashbacks have nothing to do with the story. They’re just there to be funny. And that is a shallow indulgence that South Park is quite above. And for that, I salute them.

But to my point: what is out there? Well, I can’t tell you all the correct paths to traverse, but I can tell you some things to avoid.

Number one: Don’t get a tattoo of a Chinese character on your fanny if you don’t understand the language. Tattoo removal services are making a killing off of people’s stupidity, because Little Miss Individuality walks into the tattoo parlor and gets an Asian symbol she thinks means “Spiritual Woman” but that she late finds out means “Sugar Substitute.”

Number two: Don’t be taken in by idiotic popular songs that profess to be deeper than they are. Last year, Gwen Stefani released a little ditty entitled “Hollaback Girl”. A few weeks later, she was asked during an interview, “What does ‘Hollaback Girl’ mean?” To which she replied, “What do you think it means?” So, apparently each of us was invited to create our own translation was for what she is saying to us. My translation is: “Hey Stewie, it’s Gwen. Would you please send me a bird flu sandwich?”

Number three: Stay away from the church. In the battle over science vs. religion, science offers credible evidence for all the serious claims it makes. The church says, “Oh, it’s right here in this book, see? The one written by people who thought the sun was magic?” I for one would like to see some proof that there is a God. And if you, “a baby’s smile,” I’m going to kick you right in the stomach.

Number four: Always have at least one friend who’s a Jew.

Number five: Do not create a television series about a group of people who crash land on an island if you don’t know where you’re going with it. Don’t just make it up as you go along, because if you do, it’s going to start sucking very quickly. I’m talking of course about Desperate Housewives, which is just awful. Teri Hatcher, you’re a beautiful woman, but please grow old gracefully, and without the facial work. You’re not allowed to have an exoskeleton unless you’re a beetle.

Number six: If you ever fall into a deep depression and nothing can cheer you up, don’t give up hope. Just remember that the man who played Mr. Belvedere once sat on his own balls had to be rushed to the hospital, which is absolutely hilarious.

Number seven: Do not get into politics in Florida, because you might accidentally run into Katherine Harris. This is a woman who could stand next to Hitler, and people would say, “Who’s the bitch?”

Number eight: Do not wear a wool cap indoors in the middle of summer unless you are either a douchebag or Colin Farrell. Yes, Colin, I see you there with your wool cap. Whatcha got goin’ on under that wool cap, hm? Thinkin’ about your sideburns? Oh, and it looks like you’ve got a little rip in your jeans there too. Yeah, that’s rebellious. You’re a bad boy. Society wants your jeans to be intact, but you’ll have none of it will you?

But you know, looking out there into the audience, I see so many bright young faces, poised and ready to thrust themselves into the very hearts of American’s political and financial institutions, and seize control of the levers of power at any cost. Some would call you elitist, over privileged, and preening with a snotty sense of entitlement. I call you my base.

Now, I can see by the looks on your faces that some of you disagree with me. You think you can hold onto those lofty visions of a life of nobility, hm? Still have your ideals, do you? Gonna use that big brains of yours to make a difference? Gonna make the world a better place? Be an agent for change? Volunteer? Gonna get a job in the public sector? Sacrifice the big bucks ‘cause that doesn’t matter to you? Maybe spend a few years in the Peace Corps? Save the whales, maybe? Maybe join the Environmental Defense Council? Recycle? Gonna, gonna go out and clean up a few polluted rivers like JFK, Jr.? Live in a tree? Volunteer for Legal Aide for the underprivileged? Go to Africa? No, you’re gonna sell out.

And now, brave graduates, I shall pass the verbal baton to our final speaker.

QUAGMIRE: Gentlemen and co-eds, I’d like to wish you all a good giggity, and to tell you that it is an honor to be standing before you today at this fine establishment. I feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment being here, because I’ve banged chicks in every school in the Ivy League except Harvard. You are by far the toughest to get into.

I’ll keep my remarks brief today, because I’m meeting two women and an animal handler at Hong Kong’s in about 20 minutes. Heh, heh, all-right.

Last time I was here, I had sex with a woman at the New England Aquarium, where it’s fun to find out. In fact, when I come to Boston, I sleep with a different woman every night of the week except Wednesday because in Boston’s historic North End, Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

I respect education. And I’ve drawn deep inspiration from the classics. As my favorite poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once said, “It’s going to tempt your tummy with the taste of nuts and honey. It’s a honey of an O, its Honey Nut Cheerios.” And if I may, I would like to paraphrase Dickens, but instead of Christmas traditions, I am speaking today of vaginas when I say, “They have never put one scrap of gold in my pocket, but they bring a smile to my face, so therefore I declare them good.”

If there’s one message I can leave you with this afternoon, it is this: Although you are graduating and moving on to those uncharted new frontiers of adult life, never leave behind that sense of experimentation, that bareback sense of adventure and openness. Stay young, and keep looking at the world with a sense of wide-legged wonder. Giggity, giggityand good luck to you all.

Thank you, Harvard!

I have to confess to all of you, Madame President, Board of Trustees, members of the faculty, relatives, friends, students. I have had some conflicted feelings about accepting this invitation to deliver the Commencement Address to Wellesley’s Class of 2004. My initial response, of course, was glee, a very strong sense of pleasure at, you know, participating personally and formally in the rites of an institution with this reputation: 125 years of history in women’s education, an enviable rostrum of graduates, its commitment sustained over the years in making a difference in the world, and its successful resistance to challenges that women’s colleges have faced from the beginning and throughout the years. An extraordinary record-and I was delighted to be asked to participate and return to this campus.

But my second response was not so happy. I was very anxious about having to figure out something to say to this particular class at this particular time, because I was really troubled by what could be honestly said in 2004 to over 500 elegantly educated women, or to relatives and friends who are relieved at this moment, but hopeful as well as apprehensive. And to a college faculty and administration dedicated to leadership and knowledgeable about what that entails. Well, of course, I could be sure of the relatives and the friends, just tell them that youth is always insulting because it manages generation after generation not only to survive and replace us, but to triumph over us completely.

And I would remind the faculty and the administration of what each knows: that the work they do takes second place to nothing, nothing at all, and that theirs is a first order profession. Now, of course to the graduates I could make reference to things appropriate to your situations–the future, the past, the present, but most of all happiness. Regarding the future, I would have to rest my case on some bromide, like the future is yours for the taking. Or, that it’s whatever you make of it. But the fact is it is not yours for the taking. And it is not whatever you make of it. The future is also what other people make of it, how other people will participate in it and impinge on your experience of it.

But I’m not going to talk anymore about the future because I’m hesitant to describe or predict because I’m not even certain that it exists. That is to say, I’m not certain that somehow, perhaps, a burgeoning ménage a trois of political interests, corporate interests and military interests will not prevail and literally annihilate an inhabitable, humane future. Because I don’t think we can any longer rely on separation of powers, free speech, religious tolerance or unchallengeable civil liberties as a matter of course. That is, not while finite humans in the flux of time make decisions of infinite damage. Not while finite humans make infinite claims of virtue and unassailable power that are beyond their competence, if not their reach. So, no happy talk about the future.

Maybe the past offers a better venue. You already share an old tradition of an uncompromisingly intellectual women’s college, and that past and that tradition is important to both understand and preserve. It’s worthy of reverence and transmission. You’ve already learned some strategies for appraising the historical and economical and cultural past that you have inherited. But this is not a speech focusing on the splendor of the national past that you are also inheriting.

You will detect a faint note of apology in the descriptions of this bequest, a kind of sorrow that accompanies it, because it’s not good enough for you. Because the past is already in debt to the mismanaged present. And besides, contrary to what you may have heard or learned, the past is not done and it is not over, it’s still in process, which is another way of saying that when it’s critiqued, analyzed, it yields new information about itself. The past is already changing as it is being reexamined, as it is being listened to for deeper resonances. Actually it can be more liberating than any imagined future if you are willing to identify its evasions, its distortions, its lies, and are willing to unleash its secrets.

But again, it seemed inappropriate, very inappropriate, for me to delve into a past for people who are in the process of making one, forging their own, so I consider this focusing on your responsibility as graduates-graduates of this institution and citizens of the world-and to tell you once again, repeat to you the admonition, a sort of a wish, that you go out and save the world. That is to suggest to you that with energy and right thinking you can certainly improve, certainly you might even rescue it. Now that’s a heavy burden to be placed on one generation by a member of another generation because it’s a responsibility we ought to share, not save the world, but simply to love it, meaning don’t hurt it, it’s already beaten and scoured and gasping for breath. Don’t hurt it or enable others who do and will. Know and identify the predators waving flags made of dollar bills. They will say anything, promise anything, do everything to turn the planet into a casino where only the house cards can win-little people with finite lives love to play games with the infinite. But I thought better of that, selecting your responsibilities for you. If I did that, I would assume your education had been in vain and that you were incapable of deciding for yourself what your responsibilities should be.

So, I’m left with the last thing that I sort of ignored as a topic. Happiness. I’m sure you have been told that this is the best time of your life. It may be. But if it’s true that this is the best time of your life, if you have already lived or are now living at this age the best years, or if the next few turn out to be the best, then you have my condolences. Because you’ll want to remain here, stuck in these so-called best years, never maturing, wanting only to look, to feel and be the adolescent that whole industries are devoted to forcing you to remain.

One more flawless article of clothing, one more elaborate toy, the truly perfect diet, the harmless but necessary drug, the almost final elective surgery, the ultimate cosmetic-all designed to maintain hunger for stasis. While children are being eroticized into adults, adults are being exoticized into eternal juvenilia. I know that happiness has been the real, if covert, target of your labors here, your choices of companions, of the profession that you will enter. You deserve it and I want you to gain it, everybody should. But if that’s all you have on your mind, then you do have my sympathy, and if these are indeed the best years of your life, you do have my condolences because there is nothing, believe me, more satisfying, more gratifying than true adulthood. The adulthood that is the span of life before you. The process of becoming one is not inevitable. Its achievement is a difficult beauty, an intensely hard won glory, which commercial forces and cultural vapidity should not be permitted to deprive you of.

Now, if I can’t talk inspiringly and hopefully about the future or the past or the present and your responsibility to the present or happiness, you might be wondering why I showed up. If things are that dour, that tentative, you might ask yourself, what’s this got to do with me? What about my life? I didn’t ask to be born, as they say. I beg to differ with you. Yes, you did! In fact, you insisted upon it. It’s too easy, you know, too ordinary, too common to not be born. So your presence here on Earth is a very large part your doing.

So it is up to the self, that self that insisted on life that I want to speak to now-candidly-and tell you the truth that I have not really been clearheaded about, the world I have described to you, the one you are inheriting. All my ruminations about the future, the past, responsibility, happiness are really about my generation, not yours. My generation’s profligacy, my generation’s heedlessness and denial, its frail ego that required endless draughts of power juice and repeated images of weakness in others in order to prop up our own illusion of strength, more and more self congratulation while we sell you more and more games and images of death as entertainment. In short, the palm I was reading wasn’t yours, it was the splayed hand of my own generation and I know no generation has a complete grip on the imagination and work of the next one, not mine and not your parents’, not if you refuse to let it be so. You don’t have to accept those media labels. You need not settle for any defining category. You don’t have to be merely a taxpayer or a red state or a blue state or a consumer or a minority or a majority.

Of course, you’re general, but you’re also specific. A citizen and a person, and the person you are is like nobody else on the planet. Nobody has the exact memory that you have. What is now known is not all what you are capable of knowing. You are your own stories and therefore free to imagine and experience what it means to be human without wealth. What it feels like to be human without domination over others, without reckless arrogance, without fear of others unlike you, without rotating, rehearsing and reinventing the hatreds you learned in the sandbox. And although you don’t have complete control over the narrative (no author does, I can tell you), you could nevertheless create it.

Although you will never fully know or successfully manipulate the characters who surface or disrupt your plot, you can respect the ones who do by paying them close attention and doing them justice. The theme you choose may change or simply elude you, but being your own story means you can always choose the tone. It also means that you can invent the language to say who you are and what you mean. But then, I am a teller of stories and therefore an optimist, a believer in the ethical bend of the human heart, a believer in the mind’s disgust with fraud and its appetite for truth, a believer in the ferocity of beauty. So, from my point of view, which is that of a storyteller, I see your life as already artful, waiting, just waiting and ready for you to make it art.

Thank you.

If anybody feels like perspiring, I'd advise you to go ahead, because I'm sure going to. In fact I'm gonna.

Greetings ["parents"?] and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005. 

There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes "What the hell is water?"

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story ["thing"] turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I'm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education's meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let's talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about quote teaching you how to think. If you're like me as a student, you've never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I'm going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we're supposed to get in a place like this isn't really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.

Here's another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: "Look, it's not like I don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn't see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out 'Oh, God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard, and I'm gonna die if you don't help me.'" And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. "Well then you must believe now," he says, "After all, here you are, alive." The atheist just rolls his eyes. "No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp."

It's easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people's two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy's interpretation is true and the other guy's is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person's most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there's the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They're probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists' problem is exactly the same as the story's unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up.

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realist, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it's so socially repulsive. But it's pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people's thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.

Please don't worry that I'm getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It's a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being "well-adjusted", which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education -- least in my own case -- is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.

As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.

This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger. And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let's get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what "day in day out" really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I'm talking about.

By way of example, let's say it's an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you're tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there's no food at home. You haven't had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store's confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren't enough check-out lanes open even though it's the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can't take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line's front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to "Have a nice day" in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera. Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn't yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year. But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it's going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.

Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV's and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumperstickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest (this is an example of how NOT to think, though) most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the future's fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.

You get the idea.

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn't have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It's the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities.

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it's not impossible that some of these people in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.

Again, please don't think that I'm giving you moral advice, or that I'm saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it's hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just flat out won't want to.

But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it's also not impossible. It just depends what you what to consider. If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it. This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to worship.

Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.

They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing. And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.

That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing. I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don't just dismiss it as just some finger wagging Dr. Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:

"This is water."

"This is water."

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.

I wish you way more than luck.

Going to school at Virginia Tech has been a family tradition…going back to my great-uncle William Slater Cowart, who graduated 95 years ago.

It's been 26 years since I sat out there in this stadium…a stadium then half this size…played in by a football team half as good as today's…and I received a degree that was probably half as good as the one you will receive at tomorrow's ceremony.

I love this school. I love the way it never stops growing and getting better…

This is a day that will live on in your memories for forty…fifty…sixty years or more…years that will go by at a speed you cannot yet imagine.

Besides feeling incredibly honored, your invitation did a great thing for me…it caused me to spend some "quiet time"…away from the daily business of winning and losing…thinking over the…thousands of careers I have observed over the years…and over my own career…and what some of the great people I have known…have taught me.

Over the next eight minutes or so I will offer a view, influenced heavily by my investment in GE's leadership development, of the personal characteristics you will need to cultivate…as you enter the real world tomorrow… in business… science… engineering… architecture… the military… whatever you now believe you want to do with your life.

I worked for a guy named Jack Welch for twenty years at GE. He was…and is…a great mentor as much as a great leader. If I had to isolate the subject he spoke most passionately to me about…over all those years…it is that SELF CONFIDENCE is the most important…the indispensable characteristic of success…the common characteristic shared by great leaders whose talents may have varied widely in most other respects.

Self-confidence…a quiet self-confidence…not cockiness…not conceit…not arrogance…is the key to winning…to excelling…no matter what you do in life.

Some of you may already have the beginnings of this confidence from academic…or athletic…or even social success…but in my experience…that will not be enough to get you through a career…and a life that will thrill you…rather than scare…or bore you.

Henry David Thoreau once said, 'the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation". I don't believe that most do…but I do believe that quietly desperate people are the ones who never quite found their self-confidence.

So, how do you get it? What is the secret to developing your own brand of self-confidence?

First, you must resolve to grow…intellectually…morally…technically…and professionally…every day through your entire work and family life.

When I walked out of this stadium a quarter century ago… the half life of knowledge…particularly scientific and engineering knowledge… was probably five or six years. What I hope you will remember today is that unless you walk away from here resolutely determined to stay at the very leading edge of your profession… you will be out of touch and headed for irrelevance in just two or three years… or maybe sooner.

You need to be absolutely paranoid about the currency of your knowledge… and ask yourself every day… am I really up to speed? Or am I stagnating intellectually… faking it… or even worse… falling behind? Am I still learning? Or am I just doing the same stuff on a different day… or… as Otis Redding sings… "Sitting on the dock of the bay… watching the tide roll away"

The lust for learning is age-independent

In my world, we have 55 and 60-year-old engineers in our jet engine business, who are as leading-edge as anyone I know. Their lust for learning defines their very being… at work and in their communities. They have perfected the habit of learning… and they practice it every working hour… despite the fact that many of them are… already… the world's leading experts in their respective fields.

In contrast, we occasionally find a 30 year-old tip-toeing around the place who has already forgotten how to learn… who may have actually listened to someone who told them that "today marks the end of learning and the time to begin doing". If you bring that mindset to companies like ours, your career will be short-lived. We compensate people for what we believe they will learn… for the discoveries that lie ahead… not for yesterday's news.

Great institutions have to do the same. Thanks to forward-looking leadership and learning, this wonderful school never stops growing… and because of that… it has helped you grow.

Starting tomorrow you must learn to grow on your own.

Another important way… to build your confidence… is to seek out the toughest jobs… the most daunting scientific… engineering… or management challenges. In my world, the world of business, we look for situations where intense global competition or technical innovation, threatens the very survival of a business. We ask our most talented people to take on these assignments. In these situations, your purpose is clearly before you when you wake up in the morning… and there is nothing like survival to engage the mind.

One of GE's greatest acquisitions has been a company called Amersham, led by man named Sir William Castell. A man approaching his sixties who now runs our enormous Healthcare business… and whose purpose in life… every waking hour… is to solve the Human Genome riddle and customizes therapy for each and every patient, Sir Bill has taught GE that while the great schools and companies can teach you process… it all means very little without purpose. Process without purpose is pretty much the definition of bureaucracy… rather than a formula for achievement and personal fulfillment.

Let me give you another example. September 11…2001…was Jeff Immelt's first real day on the job as the chairman and CEO of GE… and I had just taken over as CEO of the company's jet engine business.

Jeff and I were at an Aerospace Industry meeting in Seattle that awful day. We awoke early… Pacific time… to watch… in horror… as it unfolded on television. Both of us were afraid for our country… our way of life… and… finally… for our Company.

We were grounded for the next few days… stranded in Seattle… and unavoidably began to think through the implications of this event on our Company and its 350,000 associates. I got to observe this brand new 47 year-old CEO of the world's most respected company… steel himself for what lay ahead.

Jeff had… in his portfolio… our business… whose primary customer was the world's airline industry. GE owns and leases the largest fleet of airplanes in the world… a world that for all anyone knew, might not fly any more. Jeff also insured billions of dollars in property and buildings in the World Trade Center complex. NBC…yet another GE business… was operating 24/7 for weeks with no advertising… and hemorrhaging cash. With GE so intertwined in the global economy… and economy now a big question mark… virtually every business under Jeff lay under a cloud.

My view…and the consensus of my colleagues who know Jeff…is that he grew five years… in terms of stature… leadership skills…judgment… and…above all… self-confidence… in the year that followed the tragedy of 9/11. I know I learned more in one year than I had in the previous four. Difficult situations, bring real purpose and resolve in our decision-making.

Our confidence and belief in an ever more inter-dependent global economy sustained our commitment to invest and grow in these difficult markets.

While there is nothing that builds confidence more than winning against the odds… believe it or not… losing against great odds builds it as well. Most great companies… love people who take big swings… even if they have to walk back to the dugout on occasion and sit down. Seek out the businesses… the technical challenges… the government projects… that others are afraid to touch. The world will soon get to know you… and more important… you will get to know yourself.

Seek a real purpose. Seek to make a difference.

Now… on the subject of getting to know yourself. Evaluate strengths and weaknesses with cool objectivity. Even as your confidence grows you must suppress your ego… focus on your weaknesses and ways to overcome them. What are your sources of anxiety?

Years ago…still early in my career… I realized that I had no real experience with customers… a shortcoming that caused me great personal anxiety… particularly, in light of my boss's desire to promote me quickly into business leadership. So…against the advice of my boss…I took a job…and a demotion…to work in sales. Never made a better career move in my life. My confidence grew and my anxiety abated. You will have similar decisions to make.

At another period, I found myself envious of the courage and resourcefulness of GE executives who spent years in the developing world… in Southeast Asia… or in South America… with strange languages and business practices… and different time lines and ways of getting things done. So I uprooted my family… with their consent… and took a job in Asia… faced into the unknown… made more than a few mistakes… and am better for it… and so is my family.

Move to… or experience… a foreign country as early as you can in your career if you have not already. Go to China… to Southeast Asia… to North Africa… or to India. That is where the future is.

Know yourself… and to your own self be true. You may find some day three or four years from now that you simply don't like engineering… or teaching… or architecture… or government… or the company you started with. You have little in common with the people you work with, and relative to your peers, you find your interest waning.

At that point you have to muster whatever self-confidence you have… and every bit of your courage… and make the decision to do something else with your life.. It is always better sooner than later… to make that call.

Over the next few years, you will hear a lot about "work/life balance".

This issue… at its heart… comes down once again to self-confidence.

Five short years after graduating from Virginia Tech, I fell into a terrible rut… hanging around the office twelve and fourteen hours a day. It was a habit I developed after joining GE's Corporate Audit staff. I routinely found myself getting home well after the kids fell asleep.

Then I took a job working for a GE Vice Chairman named Larry Bossidy. I quickly noticed a few things about Larry… who retired recently as CEO of Honeywell. Larry came to work at a reasonable time… and left in time for dinner… even if there was the ever-present possibility that Jack Welch might try to track him down in the evening.

By the time I started working for him he had nine children. He actually knew their names… and he actually went to a fair number of their games and school functions. Yet, if you surveyed the GE Leadership team at any time during Larry's tenure, they would tell you that Larry got more done than anyone they had ever known. The title of Larry's book "Confronting Reality… Doing What Matters to Get Things Right" says a little something about his philosophy.

Larry has… and I hope I now have… the self-confidence to let achievements… rather than time spent in the office… define our value.

Nothing on earth can replace my oldest daughter's volleyball games, my next daughter's concerts, my son's hockey games, or coaching my youngest daughter's basketball team… nothing on earth!

My father would sacrifice almost any amount of time to save a dollar. I …on the other hand… would spend almost any amount of money to save a minute. I consider myself very fortunate to have learned this vital lesson early.

There is one…final… attribute of self-confidence I would like to mention before I leave you… the one attribute you must not fail to make your own… if you have not done so already.

You must achieve the confidence of knowing that you possess absolute… unbending… unimpeachable integrity. Everyone must know that… above all else… it is integrity that defines your character.

With the parade of disgraced… indicted… CEO's and CFO's… accountants… and men and women and families caught up in things they never would have initiated on their own… you have to wonder when it was… exactly what day it was… that these people… whose lives are now in ruins… came to work and decided to… or were asked… to do something that was probably wrong.

On what day… at what moment… does this begin? When does that first bad cell split?

There may come a day in your career when you are asked to approve… or go along with… or wink at… or ignore… something that… if you go along with it… will have a positive impact on some measure or metric that you, your institution, or your friends will be judged favorably for.

You may know that day… that you… and your colleagues… are near the edge. The lawyers or compliance people may say it's "OK"… or "it shouldn't be a problem"… or "that's the way they do business in China"… or Hungary… or in the insurance industry… or wherever. It is not the way of global business.

So understand that when you are conscious that you are near the edge… that line in the sand… that line in your soul… is moving closer to you… not further away. You must have the confidence… and the courage… to say, "No… we are not doing this".

Then you can go home, look your family in the eye, and sleep like a baby.

And there is nothing more important in any career than the ability to do that.

This concludes my offering to you on your big day: the simplest and best advice I could think of… advice that I will continue to follow as my own career continues:

Grow your self-confidence… and move quickly to repair it when it is damaged by the setbacks and failures and mistakes that lie ahead for us all.

Continue to grow intellectually… and listen to the little alarm inside you that sounds when stagnation or boredom… or becoming a know-it-all… begin to creep up on your.

Tackle the toughest jobs and challenges… and watch yourself do more… and learn more… than you ever dreamed possible.

Understand the difference between process and purpose… and never begin a day without being able to articulate that purpose… even if it's only to yourself.

Know yourself… particularly your weaknesses… and don't let a day pass without moving toward eliminating them.

And understand that whatever else may fail you… whatever bad luck or failure may befall you… your personal integrity is always in your own hands and can never be taken from you.

Congratulations to you all… and to the families that love you and have supported you during these important years.

With the self-confidence you have earned, it is time for you to go out and make them even prouder.

Thanks … and good luck.

Congratulations, class of 2005, the greatest graduating class in the history of Durham Academy. If you’ve grown up here in the Triangle this may be the first southern accent you’ve heard, so I will try to speak clearly and distinctly and remove all tobacco products from my mouth.

This is a glorious day for you graduating seniors and a bittersweet one for your parents, teachers and counselors.

One morning last fall at the beginning of the schoo l year, as Ed Costello was standing there watching the parking lot fill up with Beamers, SUVs, Mercedes and Lexuses he turned to Michael Ulku - Steiner and in a hushed reverential tone said, “I believe of all the students we have ever seen matriculate here at Durham Academy, this class, the class of 2005, is surely the most recent.”

It is an honor to talk to a graduating class where practically everybody makes straight A’s. Everybody excels. Everybody is sensitive, supportive, diverse and multicultural. I’ ve seen your college applications and all of you have a 4. 5 grade - point - average, you’ve worked with the needy and the homeless, with Aids babies in sub - Saharan Africa, you’ve unlocked the secrets of the human genome, and in your spare time you cobble your own shoes. Upon graduation many of you will be canonized. Others will simply be assumed bodily into heaven. I salute you.

If you are as ripe under the non - breathable fabric of those robes as I am already just looking at you then you know this talk wil l be short. I will try to finish before new life forms evolve. When Melinda and I first talked to Gibb Fitzpatrick in DA Admissions about transferring Jackson from a public school in Hillsborough to Durham Academy we told him that our main concern with a private school was that we didn’t want our son to be turned into a little snot. I’m delighted to report he hasn’t been. But I have. Now I’m a big snot. A DA snob . To my mind, no other school , public or private, can compare to DA. And I will tell you why.

Now there’s something about the commencement address that brings out the pompous and pretentious in all who deliver them, the stained - glass voice, the first person oracular, the Madonna - high - on - Kabala. For all I know, by the time I’m done I’ll be speaking with a British accent. But don’t worry, this is not a self - help commencement talk . For one thing, selves are not that easy to help. Selves, as you will discover, take time and hard work.

I should know. I was a loser in high school. With grades, with girls, with sports. I did not excel. I stayed home and drew. Mad Magazine was my inspiration. I once concocted a parody of the popular Batman TV show called “Ratman,” which featured several of my teachers at school. My friends laughed at “Ratman” but one said scornfully, “You spent your weekend doing this?” Yes, I was a geek, a dweeb, a dork, a tool. I still am, but for a cartoonist that’s a job description. Sorry, Catherine. So though I tip my mortarboard to all you high school winners – the sharp, the slick, the self - possessed, the well - spoken, the body - doubles for the cast of One Tree Hill – I’m directing these remarks to the potted plants and human wallpaper of the student body as well, the ones who don’t stand out, who feel like extras in a movie about somebody else’s life. 

And I’m here to tell all my fellow dweebs and losers that your day will come. High school is not the final word on you. It’s a long and winding road. The game is not over. It has just begun. Things change. You change. Baby fat melts away. Faces clear up. There is hope.

And today is the beginning, Square One, for all of you. Commencement. Today the graduating class of 2005 says “Dude, whassup, yo? ” to the real world.

And who better than a cartoonist to help administer your graduation reality check? Actually my job has been getting harder and harder in recent years. Increasingly, reality itself is becoming a cartoon. Every day it gets weirder, more distorted, grotesque and bizarre out there. How do you cartoon a cartoon? And even my night job as a novelist is becoming more and more of a challenge. Real life has become stranger than fiction. So how do you fictionalize a culture like ours, one that is already exaggerated, distorted, surreal? How do you top reality?

You’ve heard everybody talk about the crazy times you live in, but because it’s the only time you live in you have no way of knowing just how psycho things have become.

Ease up on yourselves. Have some compassion for yourself as well as for others. There’s no such thing as perfection, and life is not a race.

Check it out.

Plato and Aristotle asked: How ought one to live? Kierkegaard put it another way: “What must I do to be saved?” Today higher education asks: “How did you do on your SATs?” I’m not going to tell you what I made on my SATs but let me put it this way: none of your places at Princeton would have been threatened. I know it’s hard to believe but in real life nobody cares what you made on your SATs. I’m not saying it doesn’t matter how you scored – those fat and skinny envelopes from the spring attest – but I want to help put SATs and tests in general in perspective.

A few years ago I was at a dinner in New York with a bunch of people who were getting something called the Golden Plate, an achievement award for doing well in their fields. Some were celebrities -- Barbara Walters, Calvin Klein, Colin Powell -- others were less well - known, but had done things like discover the planet Pluto. Oprah emceed. I was the least famous person there. The idea was to get a bunch of “achievers” together and bring in four hundred high school National Merit Finalists from around the country for three days of schmoozing with the accomplished. The idea, I suppose, was that achievement was contagious, like pink eye.

We took a cruise around Manhattan, dined at the Temple of Dendur in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, hung out at the Waldorf and exchanged business cards with seventeen - year - olds. At a black tie dinner where we collected our Golden Plates the final night I was seated between the soap star Susan Lucci and the Pulitzer - prize winning poet James Merrill. The next morning at breakfast I was discussing the event with a Nobel Prize - winning physicist from Stanford who had discovered the sub - atomic particles called quarks. What would a cartoonist and a physicist have to say to each other? We talked about quantum mechanics, the periodic table, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, 4 and Oprah’s weight. We agreed that the kids we had met seemed ambitious, self - possessed, well - spoken and generally perfect for the name - brand colleges they were entering in the fall. The Nobel Laureate asked me, “Would you have been invited to something like this when you were in high school?” I laughed and said, “No, I wasn’t a very good student.” He shook his head and said, “I didn’ t even finish high school.”

I was stunned. “You’re kidding.”

“I had to get my high school equivalency later,” he confessed. Then, looking around us, he said, “I wonder how many of the others invited here were National Merit Scholars in high school.”

What he was hinting at was the puzzle of human personality, the mystery of success, late - blooming talent and confidence, the ineffable qualities of character, drive and ambition, qualities that are often key components of achievement and are sometimes even galvanized by those early high school humiliations.

I tell you this not to debunk academic achievement – why, some of my best friends were National Merit Finalists , and I’m certainly not plugging underachievement -- but simply to say that success in life isn’t always predictable. Sometimes, as my quarky friend was implying, success happens long after the college admissions officers have had their say.

In the spirit of keeping things in perspective, remember, it was Harvard grads, the best and the brightest, who got us into Vietnam. It was a Duke Law graduate -- Richard Nixon -- who obstructed justice, ignored subpoenas and was forced to resign the presidency. It was a graduate of Georgetown, Yale, and Oxford, a Rhodes Scholar – Bill Clinton -- who disgraced the office of the presidency, lied under oath, and taught a generation how to parse the meaning of is . Enron execs were, as the book title puts it, The Smartest Guys in the Room . Lawyers today rationalize torture. As they once did segregation and slavery. The novelist Walker Percy once said that you can make straight A’s in school and still flunk life. Which is another way of saying, you can win the race and still lose your soul. As you venture out into the world, you need to know more than how to win the race. Unfortunately, our culture has sent you exactly the opposite message. A recent New Yorker cartoon shows a bum seated on an orange crate with a sign that says, “Blew off my SAT prep class.”

Yes, it’s a bottom - line world out there, boys and girls. Everything -- including education -- has been commodified. Consequently, we think everything worth knowing is test - able, quantifiable, and measurable. It’s no mystery that so many kids today are on Ritalin. Standardized education requires standardized little people.

During the past several months, you’ve undoubtedly experienced great anxiety about getting into college. There’s a reason for that. You’ve heard the expression, “Follow the money.” Well, there’s money in having you feel that anxiety. T e college entrance industry has a stake in your stress and discomfort. Just as the drug companies have an interest in encouraging your feelings of misery or inadequacy. You’ve seen the commercials for antidepressants, mood brighteners and other psychopharm aceuticals.

“Are you anxious, depressed? Take a pill; it’s not okay to struggle. Discomfort is not allowed.”

” Do you find it hard to focus? Then you may have Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. Now that we’ve medicated all your children, do we have a pill for you!

Almost everyone is anxious or depressed or distracted sometimes. It’s called being human. What used to be the human condition is now a symptom for a disorder or a disease for which they have a cure. But instead of recognizing that fact andign oring the sales pitch, we begin to wonder what’s wrong with us. Whether the cure is deodorant, mouthwash or Ivy League schools, marketing and advertising are designed first to create a sense of inadequacy and anxiety, then to offer to solve the artificially created problem by selling you the solution.

You’ve grown up in a time when performance is everything, whether it’s soccer or AP courses or urine tests. From the time you’re a toddler trying to master potty training until you begin bracing yourself for college rejection slips, Performance Anxiety is marketed to you in discreet and insidious ways. Harvard, Yale and Princeton are presented as the educational equivalent of Viagra, Cialis and Enzyte. The big fix. If you get in, they’ll cure what ails you, put a smile on your face, a spring in your step, and give you lifetime bragging rights. But beware the side effects of this pressurized culture of achievement. Binge drinking, eating disorders and college suicides are all perfection diseases, ways of acting out the impossibility of perfection. Ease up on yourselves. Have some compassion for yourself as well as for others. There’s no such thing as perfection, and life is not a race.

As the shattering events of recent weeks have taught us, no matter how nice things may appear on the surface, no matter how privileged and manicured our lives, the darkness in life will come to all of us, the tragic dimension will rise up and bushwhack us on the road to perfection.

Since I seem to have fallen into the trap of all commencement speakers and started to give you the advice I promised I wouldn’t, what - the - hey, let me finish before the British accent kicks in. Here’s my advice:

Don’t get caught downloading music.

Don’t email anything you wouldn’t want forwarded.

Practice, practice, practice. It’s hard to get worse at something if you practice. But talent is not enough. Talent is not creativity, just as a seed is not a crop. You have to till the soil, plant the seed, work it, water it, harvest it. Creativity is hard work.

Don’t worship celebrities. With the fall of communism the only ism left to worry about is showbiz.

Read. Reading is active. TV, movies and video are passive. Reading engages your imagination. Video substitutes for your imagination. Reading takes you into life, while television distracts you from life.

Recognize political correctness for what it is: a bureaucratic substitute for thinking. It evolved out of a righteous impulse to rectify historic wrongs -- racism, sexism, various forms of bigotry -- but it has morphed into a Stalinist means of suppressing free speech. It thrives on campuses and in the human resources departments of large corporations. It’s a way for businesses to pretend to have consciences. It’s cheaper t o install handicapped parking spaces and make employees watch films on sexual harassment and attend sensitivity training sessions than to pay them decent wages. It is modern - day Phariseeism. Jesus had a colorful phrase for Pharisees, the so - called “experts” of his time: “hypocrites,” “brood of vipers.” He considered virtue a private matter and said, “take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them . . . do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the streets, that they may have glory of men.”

And while I’m waxing biblical, repent of labels, the sophisticated name - calling we dispatch so easily – manic - depressive, bipolar, OCD, ADD – to summarize and pigeonhole and reduce the complexity of human beings to a sound - bite. Such labels dehumanize people and enslave us to stereotypes and limit us with reduced expectations, all defined by the word ‘can’t.’ “Oh, he can’t because he’s ADD. Or she can’t; she only scored 1100 on her SAT, you know.”

Be suspicious of experts. Especially those promiscuous dispensers of labels and meds. Question authority, including your own. But always trust your own experience and instincts over the experts. When my high school guidance counselor called me in for my one and only college counsel ing session – this was before college admission was a growth industry – he asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I told him I wanted to be an artist. I didn’t know what that meant exactly. Art, where I come from, was black velvet Elvises, poker pl aying dogs, and popsicle stick birdhouses. Culture was something you scraped off the cow’s tongue to check for hoof - and - mouth disease. All I knew was that I wanted to draw pictures for a living. The counselor looked stricken. “Douglas, believe me, when you get to college, artists are a dime a dozen.” Then, looking at my grades, he said, “Why don’t you use your math skills and drafting ability and study architecture?” I realize now that no responsible high school guidance counselor would ever in good con science tell some kid, “Sure, go ahead, be an artist, move to New York, live in an attic and starve.” Fortunately, I knew enough to ignore the experts, but I want you to know that manners do matter. So I did nod politely, and said “Yessir,” as I left the g uidance counselor’s office.

So whether you wind up blazing your own trail, or stumbling blindly down it as I did, have high standards. Strive for excellence. But don’t condemn yourself when you fall short. High expectation without condemnation. If you have to be perfect, if you have to make a hundred on the test, you may not take the test.

Be competitive, but remember, envy is not competition. The word “competition” derives from the Latin con , which means “with” and petere , which means “to strive.” Competition – to strive together. Competitors are in secret alliance, not to do each other in, but to bring out the best in each other.

Don’t do drugs. I know I sound like the mom in “Almost Famous,” but she was right. Anybody can do drugs . It takes no special talent to get drunk or get high. I worry especially about children of privilege like you, and the secret guilt you may feel about your advantages. You may drug yourselves to level the playing field, to dumb yourselves down. Don’t. Life’s a gift. Don’t anesthetize yourself to it. Feel life in all its pain and mystery. If you can’t feel pain, you won’t feel joy, either. There’s plenty of time to be comatose, like for the rest of eternity.

Above all, remember: You are not your resume. External measures won’t repair you. Money won’t fix you. Applause, celebrity, no number of victories will do it. The only honor that counts is that which you earn and that which you bestow. Honor yourself.

And despite all I’ve said about the authorities, honor your parents. You will eventually realize that there are no grownups. We are all children in various stages of growing up. And you undoubtedly know that we adults are the phonies and hypocrites that Holden Caulfield said we were fifty years ago. But you will learn in time that this is a good thing. If we didn’t insist that you do as we say, not as we do, civilization would crumble. Nevertheless, it is a truism that the older we get the more we realize that nobody really knows anything. You will learn this, too. In fact, a pretty good definition of maturity is knowing how immature you are. A pretty good definition of sanity is knowing how crazy you are. A pretty good definition of wisdom is knowing how foolish you are.

We parents may not know everything under the sun, but one thing is for certain: we think you hung the moon.

Have fun, don’t worry, be happy, pick up your towels off the floor, and don’t call directory assistance for numbers you can look up yourself. Thank you and congratulations, Durham Academy’s Class of 2005!

It’s 2005 and you are graduating from college. Take a minute to let that sink in. You have accomplished something extraordinary. Made a decision to develop yourselves more than most people in the world ‘ intellectually, socially, experientially.. You’ve followed through and gotten your degree. Know how important that is? You are special. I’d like to go on and say that now you have the responsibility to be leaders of your communities, of the world, but I would be sounding too much like a Mother if I talked that way.

Now that it’s over you have two things to spend your life with: YOU and THE WORLD. It’s a very different world from the one we women entered in 1949. People didn’t have television yet. There was clean air and clean water and no bands of smog on the horizon.

No excess plastic packaging and no SUVs. Even though, in 1859, the British physicist John Tyndall had identified the phenomenon now referred to as the ‘natural greenhouse effect’ and in 1894, a Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became convinced that humans were altering the earth’s energy balance, it was not common knowledge in 1949. I took the environment for granted. Now, the air is polluted, the water is polluted and we are told the polar ice cap will be gone by 2080. The sun is too hot. The winds are too violent. The rain is too heavy. As my 22 year- old son says: ‘My generation may be all right but our children will not.’ The planet needs help and each one of you must decide how you will help it. You must help.

"No man is an island, entire of itself; Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in all mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."

That’s John Donne writing 400 years ago. I do not find it surprising that frightened people are turning to religious extremism. Don’t we all want to deny what is happening to our little planet? But if God created the Heavens and the Earth and all living things, then it is immoral and irreligious for us to destroy this Creation ‘ to foul our own nest.

You entered college in the September now known as 9/11 so you have spent your college years processing thoughts and feelings about tragic terrorist acts on American soil, plus the entrance of the United States of America into preemptive war. I hear people saying with increasing frequency, ‘We used to be great but now we’re just fat.’ You can probably accept that condemnation easier than I can because I grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts where one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had lived.

Those of us or, at least, those of us living in New York City who were not killed on 9/11 wondered when our time would come; but now here we all are and together sharing a day of joy and fulfillment ‘ a day we will all remember as special. There is a passage in Next Time I'll Sing to You by James Saunders that possibly speaks of our feelings.

‘There lies behind everything, and you can believe this or not as you wish, a certain quality which we may call grief. It’s always there, just under the surface, just behind the façade, sometimes very nearly exposed, so that you can see dimly the shape of it as you can see sometimes through the surface of an ornamental pond on a still day, the dark, gross, inhuman outline of a carp gliding slowly past; when you suddenly realize that the carp were always there, below the surface, even while the water sparkled in the sunshine, and while you patronized the quaint ducks and the supercilious swans, the carp were down there, unseen. It bides its time, this quality. And if you do catch a glimpse of it, you may pretend not to notice or you may turn suddenly away and romp with your children on the grass, laughing for no reason. The name of this quality is grief. GRIEF. The word is grief; the dark center of life, the incommunicable, the deaf-mute who sits behind the mind, watching it pretend, not even bothering to mock; biding its time.’

But there is more to think about than the destruction of our planet and terrorism. There are signs of people coming together. There is the European Union. At the time of my graduation, nobody was imagining a European Union ‘ after two World Wars had just devoured Europe. But we did dream of One World ‘ a One World Federation. Einstein talked of it. Wendell Wilkie wrote a book. And on a television show moderated by Barbara Walters, I was booed when I brought up the idea of one world. But now, business, where the brightest minds seem to be going these days instead of into politics, business has caught on to it and the dream that political entities will finally come round should be kept alive. As Langston Hughes said: "Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird unable to fly. Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams go, life is a barren field covered with snow." 

While the condition of the planet today demands onerous choices, your inner world is bopping along in its own creative way. Life is a creative process. The human being is a miracle like the growth of a flowering plant.. There is not a person in the world who is not fascinating if you find the right question to ask or the right observation to make.

There is no difference between your creativity and the creativity of the artist. The artist is just interested in sharing his or her creativity while civilians, as we call the rest of the world, are using their creativity to get through the day and make something of
themselves.

Do not allow society, which is a force on each human spirit as powerful as the oceans on our bodies ‘ do not allow society to devour you. Do not succumb to its desires rather than your own. And do not withdraw from it for fear it will overwhelm you. Accept the challenge. Society is not as smart as you. The individual is always smarter than the group's but the group is persuasive. Society wants you to be passive, sit back, be quiet. Don’t do it. Find your way. You have only one life and nothing but your own creativity to call your own. You can explore many fields, many continents, change routes. The adaptability of the human being is phenomenal. Ask any woman about that. And life seems long until you get near the end. Don’t waste it. Be creative.

And then there are artists. The effect of art on our lives is more profound than we usually realize. Ian McEwan, in his novel, Saturday, speaking of musicians, says ‘They give us a glimpse of what we might be, of our best selves, and of an impossible world in which you give everything you have to others but lose nothing of yourself.’ Giving to others and not losing your self is what theatre is about. It is what all human endeavor should be about.

You can see it working in theatre because, as Shakespeare says ‘ it holds the mirror up to nature. If everyone in the world would join a community theatre, would experience the giving to others and not losing oneself, the world would be a better place because theatre is about LOVE and BEAUTY. That’s what art is about. There is no room at all for hate. That is why dictators kill off artists right away ‘ to get rid of the impediment to fomenting hate.

My friend, Richard Morse, is just putting finishing touches to a book about the power of theatre. He tells a story of an Afghan village where the children were full of hate for Americans. They had never seen one and he and the actors with him started to create some theatre with the children, doing some imitations, some mime; and the hate turned to participation and laughter and community. The same thing happens with gangs in inner cities and wherever people full of learned hate are found. Think about it. Think about the profound pleasure of art ‘ and try to get our government, which is at the very bottom of the world list in support of the arts, to understand its importance to a healthy life.

If anyone had told me what my life would be, I wouldn’t have believed them. I’ve raised two families. I never even thought of one. I’ve done all kinds of things ‘ harvested crops with the British Land Army when I got out of college, spent lots of time in the woods acted a lot all over the western world, sung and danced.

When I quit law school after one year, people asked me why? Nobody likes quitters. There was no answer or mine was worse than none. ‘Well, I’m singing with a dance band, at conventions, once in a while.’ I thought, early on, that my life would be a straight line of singing in nightclubs until I was old and fat with arthritic knees like Sophie Tucker whom I saw at the Latin Quarter in Boston when she was very old and I was very young ‘ with her old lady shoes and old lady dress with beads sewn on it but singing great ‘Some of these days you’re gonna miss me Honey. Some of these days---". I wasn’t determined to be an actress or a director or a producer. Or HAPPY. I was determined to find ME and determined not to do what didn’t seem right to me. It's worked out okay. Here I am.

Some people flower early. Some late. Don’t even think about the flowering. 

Shakespeare’s sonnet number 94:
"The summer's flow'r is to the summer sweet, though to itself it only live and die." The flowers are for other people to enjoy. Your life is for you to endure and to fulfill. It’s an effort to live creatively. It will not be easy, but it will be noble.

Thank you, President Byker; members of the faculty; distinguished guests; parents, friends, family -- and, most importantly, the Class of 2005.

Thanks for having me. I was excited to come back to Calvin, and I was just telling Laura the other night about what fun it would be to come to Calvin College. And I said, you know, "Laura, I love being around so many young folks. You know, it gives me a chance to re-live my glory days in academia." She said, "George, that's not exactly how I would describe your college experience." She also said one other thing I think the graduates will appreciate hearing, good piece of advice. She said, the folks here are here to get their diploma, not to hear from an old guy go on too long. So with that sage advice, here goes.

I bring a great message of hope and freedom to Calvin College Class of 2005: There's life after Professor Vanden Bosch and English 101. Someday you will appreciate the grammar and verbal skills you learned here. And if any of you wonder how far a mastery of the English language can take you, just look what it did for me.

I thank the moms and dads here for your sacrifice and for your love. I want to thank the faculty for your hard work and dedication. And, again, I congratulate the Class of 2005. Soon -- soon you will collect your degrees and say goodbyes to a school that has been your home, and you will take your rightful place in a country that offers you the greatest freedom and opportunity on Earth. I ask that you use what you've learned here to make your own contributions to the story of American freedom.

The immigrants who founded Calvin College came to America for the freedom to worship, and they built this great school on the sturdy ground of liberty. They saw in the American "experiment" the world's best hope for freedom -- and they weren't the only ones excited about what they saw. In 1835, a young civil servant and aristocrat from France, named Alexis de Tocqueville, would publish a book about America that still resonates today.

The book is called "Democracy in America," and in it this young Frenchman said that the secret to America's success was our talent for bringing people together for the common good. De Tocqueville wrote that tyrants maintained their power by "isolating" their citizens -- and that Americans guaranteed their freedom by their remarkable ability to band together without any direction from government. The America he described offered the world something it had never seen before: a working model of a thriving democracy where opportunity was unbounded, where virtue was strong, and where citizens took responsibility for their neighbors.

Tocqueville's account is not just the observations of one man -- it is the story of our founding. It's not just a description of America at a point in time -- it is an agenda for our time. Our Founders rejected both a radical individualism that makes no room for others, and the dreary collectivism that crushes the individual. They gave us instead a society where individual freedom is anchored in communities. And in this hopeful new century, we have a great goal: to renew this spirit of community and thereby renew the character and compassion of our country.

First, we must understand that the character of our citizens is essential to society. In a free and compassionate society, the public good depends on private character. That character is formed and shaped in institutions like family, faith, and the many civil and -- social and civic organizations, from the Boy Scouts to the Rotary Clubs. The future success of our nation depends on our ability to understand the difference between right and wrong and to have the strength of character to make the right choices. Government cannot create character, but it can and should respect and support the institutions that do.

Second, we must understand the importance of keeping power close to the people. Local people know local problems, they know the names and faces of their neighbors. The heart and soul of America is in our local communities; it is in the citizen school boards that determine how our children are educated; it's in city councils and state legislators that reflect the unique needs and priorities of the people they serve; it's in the volunteer groups that transform towns and cities into caring communities and neighborhoods. In the years to come, I hope that you'll consider joining these associations or serving in government -- because when you come together to serve a cause greater than yourself, you will energize your communities and you will help build a more just and compassionate America.

Finally, we must understand that it is by becoming active in our communities that we move beyond our narrow interests. In today's complex world, there are a lot of things that pull us apart. We need to support and encourage the institutions and pursuits that bring us together. And we learn how to come together by participating in our churches and temples and mosques and synagogues; in civil rights associations; in our PTAs and Jaycees; in our gardening and book clubs, interest groups and chambers of commerce; in our service groups -- from soup kitchens to homeless shelters.

All these organizations promote the spirit of community and help us acquire the "habits of heart" that are so vital to a free society. And because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our faith-based and community groups provide the armies of compassion that help people who wonder if the American Dream is meant for them. These armies of compassion are the great engines of social change. They serve individual and local needs, and they have been found at the front of every great movement in American history.

The history of forming associations dedicated to serving others is as old as America, itself. From abolition societies and suffrage movements to immigrant aid groups and prison reform ministries, America's social entrepreneurs have often been far ahead of our government in identifying and meeting the needs of our fellow countrymen. Because they are closer to the people they serve, our faith-based and community organizations deliver better results than government. And they have a human touch: When a person in need knocks on the door of a faith-based or community organization, he or she is welcomed as a brother or a sister.

No one understood this better than another 19th century visitor to America whose name is well known to Calvin College: Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was a Dutchman who would be elected his nation's prime minister, and he knew all about the importance of associations because he founded so many of them -- including two newspapers, a political party, and a university. Kuyper contrasted the humanizing influence of independent social institutions with the "mechanical character of government." And in a famous speech right here in Grand Rapids, he urged Dutch immigrants to resist the temptation to retreat behind their own walls. He told them to go out into their adopted America and make a true difference as true Christian citizens.

Our government is encouraging all Americans to make a difference through our faith-based and community initiative; we're mobilizing Americans to volunteer through the USA Freedom Corps. We'll do our part, but, ultimately, service is up to you. It is your choice to make. As your generation takes its place in the world, all of you must make this decision: Will you be a spectator or a citizen? To make a difference in this world, you must be involved. By serving a higher calling here or abroad, you'll make your lives richer and build a more hopeful future for our world.

At Calvin College, you take this call to service to heart. You serve as "agents of renewal" across the Earth. You volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters to mentor young people. You work at Bethany Christian Services here in Grand Rapids, one of the best-known adoption services in America. A former Calvin student and professor, Vern Ehlers, serves in the halls of Congress. As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action -- a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goes back to the greatest commandment.

This isn't a Democrat idea. This isn't a Republican idea. This is an American idea. It has sustained our nation's liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too much government leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us helpless and alone. So they built a free society with many roots in community. And to keep the tree of liberty standing tall in the century before us, you must nourish those roots.

Today, the Calvin Class of 2005 looks out on an America that continues to be defined by the promise of our Declaration of Independence. We're still the nation our Founders imagined, where individual freedom and opportunity is unbounded, where community is vibrant, where compassion keeps us from resting until all our citizens take their place at the banquet of freedom and equality. And with your help, we'll all do our part to transform our great land one person and one community at a time.

Thank you for having me and may God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.

I’m not a native, but I‘m now an American, and I love this country. But I’m worried about it. I’m concerned that this nation is suffering from a collective case of Attention Deficit Disorder. We’ve become a fashion-of-the-hour fast-food society where people who have no discernible skills become celebrities, where ridiculous behavior trumps rationality and moral values often fall by the wayside in the pursuit of wealth and status.

You can be rich. But wealth isn’t measured in bling and Bentleys. It’s measured in the richness of the human spirit. It’s measured not in what we take from this world, but what we give to it. It’s measured not in caring for ourselves, but caring for others. It means, basically, making a difference in this world.

And no one is better positioned to make a difference in than you young graduates — your minds bursting with new ideas, unjaded, ready to take on the world.

But it’s going to take a lot of hard work. 

Last month, I spent almost three weeks in Rome, covering the passing of Pope John Paul II,  the conclave to choose a new Pope,  and the inauguration of Benedict XVI.

I was struck by so many aspects of the story, but one thing in particular stands out. And it’s this:

In his final days, John Paul II showed us that suffering is a part of life. It’s not all about standing on the stage, receiving the accolades of the adoring masses. Life has a downside. Life is hard. Life is going to throw curveballs at you. But to the end, John Paul II was a fighter. Fighting to do the job. Fighting to retain the connection he had to the people. Fighting to fulfill the responsibilities that had been laid on his shoulders.

What’s the lesson we can take from his struggle? That it’s not all going to be easy. Life will hand you setbacks. You will triumph, and you will fail. There will be elation, and there will be sorrow. 

Your character will be reflected not only by how you handle success, but how you handle the hard times.

Too often in life, we take the easy road. We’re lazy. We seek instant gratification. We refuse to take responsibility for ourselves and our actions. We think the world owes us something.   

Well, I hate to burst the bubble, but the world owes you nothing. To the contrary – you will only get from life what you invest in it. And there are times when you won’t be happy about what you have to do.

Sometimes, all the pressure you will face as you struggle to meet deadlines, keep your boss happy, make mortgage and car payments, and work your way up the ladder of life will seem too much. Believe me – I speak from experience.

You may be tempted to say “I just can’t do it,” or run from responsibility. Those are the moments when you have to dig deep. 

The bottom line is, you need to realize, and rely on, your inner strength. The skills you have acquired over these years in college. The fabulous potential that lies in those magnificent minds of yours. Hard work and dedication produce results. And if you put your shoulder to the wheel, you won’t need anyone to throw you a lifeline.

My first job out of college was at a tiny radio station about halfway between “Nowhere” and “Doesn’t Exist.” I made $125 dollars a week, playing country records and reading hog reports. It was the typical circuit for a young broadcaster — start in the hinterland and slowly work your way back to civilization. But I was passionate about the job. I’d come in at 7 o’clock in the morning, and still be there went the station went off the air at 2 a.m. And to this day, I remain passionate about what I do. Whether it's covering the president, or the American political process, or an earthquake, hurricane or war, I still have that enthusiasm to throw myself completely into a story  and fulfill my duty to present the truth to the American people. 

So, as you embark on that great journey to develop your career, I would encourage you to find something that ignites your passion. Something that speaks to that inner voice, your calling. It's fine to draw a paycheck — that'll keep the lights on and food on the table. But if you want to have a truly satisfying professional life, you need to find something that will engage and challenge you. 

And while you're at it, don't forget about the really important things in life: yourself, friends and family. Make time for all of those, because you're going to be so busy that if you don't, you'll turn around and suddenly be 50 years old and wonder “What happened to my life?”  Somehow,  the older you get, the faster the time flies by. As if caught in some kind of Einsteinian time warp, the clock seems to accelerate — and believe me, the years will go by more quickly than you can ever imagine. That's a lesson that took me a lot longer to learn than I would like to admit. I was so consumed with putting as much as I could into my professional life that many of the things I should have been focusing on just kind of slipped by. And it wasn't until a short while ago that I had something of an epiphany and said to myself, “Wait a minute — there's a whole other side of life that you have been missing." And now that I live my life in a more balanced fashion, it is eminently more enjoyable. 

And don't be afraid of change. If something is truly not working and you have sincerely done all you can do to make it work, chuck it and start over. Sometimes we are held hostage to our fear of change. It's much easier to stick with the status quo than it is to take the risk of switching careers. But if you are not happy in your job, it will affect every aspect of your life. It is a tragedy to talk to people who do nothing but complain about their work. Yet they stick it out, year after year because they just don't have the courage to make a change.

And for goodness sake, use your degree to do something interesting. Something that will create memories that you can look back on and say, “Wow - what a ride.” I remember, years ago, talking with a train conductor who was about to retire after 50 years on the job. I said to him, "Riding these rails all those years, you must have seen some pretty interesting things." "Nothing that comes to mind," was his response. I thought to myself, what a waste, to have worked a half century in the same job and have nothing to show for it. I suffer from the opposite problem. I have seen so many interesting and incredible things in my life that I don't have room in my addled brain to process it all.

The world needs people like you. It's pretty troubled these days. I know that previous generations are supposed to leave things better than we found them. Well, apologies from all of us — it didn’t quite work out that way. 

But here’s where you come in. 

You can help to fix it. You can spread tolerance and respect. 

Get back to the original idea of America that the individual is not the most important thing. 

Take responsibility for your own lives. 

Don’t sue if you spill your coffee. 

Don’t complain when you’re boss asks you to work late.  

Don’t run away from a commitment, then declare you were kidnapped.

Don’t diss other cultures because they’re different; embrace them for what they have to offer. 

Be diplomatic. 

Reach out and help a child  or an older person. 

Travel and get to know the world out there.

Honk your horn less. 

Don’t put a finger in your chili and complain that Wendy’s did it.

Never stop the process of discovery, and never stop teaching others.

Buy yourself something your really want, but only when you can afford it.

Don’t max out your credit cards — even Ph.D.s declare bankruptcy.

Try to do something nice for someone every day.   

Don’t rely on others to take care of you. Make it on your own.

You are here today because you had the talent and the tenacity to make it. 

As you pursue your careers, soar as high as you want to. Just remember that the rules of gravity still apply.

Take this feeling of accomplishment that you have today and use it as a force to do something that really matters.


Madam President, thank you for those kind words, and Provost, and thank you on behalf of all my fellow honorees for thedegrees you have bestowed on us today. Fellow Graduates, my wife Nane and I are deeply honored to join you and your proud families on this happy day. We offer each one of you our warmest congratulations. But I must admit that I am a bit apprehensive, because I know you are all looking at me and thinking: “There’s no way he’s going to be as good as Bono!” And you’re right: my good friend the lead singer of U2 is a hard act to follow.

Fellow Graduates, you have had a precious opportunity at this great university. You have explored the realm of ideas—ideas about what is true and false, what is right and wrong, what works and what does not.As you graduate, a new phase of your life begins. The time has come to put ideas into practice. Indeed, the story of your lives will be the story of your struggle to be true to the ideas you believe in.

It is the same for individual nations, and for our world.

As Bono said last year, the United States of America is not just a country— it is an idea. It is the idea described in the Declaration of Independence, which Benjamin Franklin and others signed here in Philadelphia—that all human beings are created equal, and have inalienable rights.

The United Nations is an idea, too. It is not just a building in Manhattan, or a piece of international machinery. It embodies a conviction on the part of people everywhere that we live on a small planet, and that our safety, our prosperity, our rights—indeed, our freedoms—are indivisible.

Your grandparents’ generation learned this hard lesson. I hope some of them are here with you today to share in this proud moment. In the 1920s and 1930s, many in this country thought that Europe’s problems were for Europeans to solve, and that dangers in Asia did not matter to the United States. Pearl Harbor proved that idea wrong in practice, while the horrors of the Holocaust proved it utterly wrong as a matter of ethical responsibility.

You, the class of 2005, have learned this lesson anew in your own time. You have seen how a poor and misgoverned country—Afghanistan—became an incubator of terrorism, with devastating consequences here in the United States. And you have seen on your television screens some of the terrible indignities suffered by your men and women from war, terrorism, tyranny, injustice, hunger, poverty, ignorance and disease.

When they were about your age, your grandparents, along with their allies in many other nations, made great sacrifices to defend freedom and restore world peace. They called their alliance “the United Nations”. Their victory in 1945 led to the establishment of the United Nations as a standing organization for global security.

The United Nations Charter is one of the milestone documents in the history of human freedom. It speaks of the equal rights of men and women, and of nations large and small; and of a world of social progress and better standards of life “in larger freedom.”

To understand what those words “in larger freedom” mean, we should recall the vision of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who did more than any other person to bring the United Nations into being. He spoke of a world in which all human beings would enjoy political and religious freedom, as well as what he called “freedom from want” and “freedom from fear”.In other words, democracy, peace and a decent standard of living should be the birthright of every person. And thus, human rights, security and development, taken together, make up the idea of “larger freedom.”

After all, a young man your age who has HIV AIDS, who cannot read or write, and who lives on the brink of starvation is not truly free–even if he can vote to choose his rulers. Equally, a young woman your age who lives in the daily shadow of civil war, or who has no say in the way her country is run, is not truly free—even if she has enough money to feed herself and her family.

The United Nations exists to help relieve this kind of suffering, and to help address its root causes.

That is why, every day, courageous and committed men and women are serving under the blue flag of the United Nations—in war zones, in humanitarian emergencies, and in poor communities all over the world.

They are diplomats, negotiating access to civilians or cease fires among warring factions. They are soldiers and police, shielding ordinary men, women and children from violence, and helping to implement peace agreements. They are aid workers arranging food deliveries and protecting refugees; human rights experts helping to strengthen the rule of law; economists and agronomists advising communities how to produce more food and distribute it better.They are in the front line of larger freedom. I hope that some of you will join them, and that all of you will recognize the value of their work.They are working today to offer hope to the people of Haiti, Kosovo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and a host of other countries.They are assisting the political transition in Iraq, where the United Nations helped draft the legal framework for last January’s elections and to train thousands of workers for polling day. They are in Afghanistan, in the occupied Palestinian territory, and in Lebanon, helping to conduct elections, and to promote stable and inclusive political institutions and long-term peace. They are saving lives from famine and disease in Darfur, while working with the African Union to protect people from the appalling crimes that have been committed there, and to find a lasting political solution to the conflict.On the other side of the Indian Ocean, they are assisting devastated regions in ten nations recover and rebuild after the tsunami last December.

These men and women who serve the United Nations are carrying out mandates given to them by the sovereign States that make up the Organization’s membership, whether in the Security Council or the General Assembly. They are doing work that no single country either can, or wants to, do on its own.

They could do very little of this work without the enormous diplomatic and financial contribution of the United States. Nor could they do it without the contributions of many other countries, particularly those who provide the troops—nearly 70,000 of them—who are deployed in some 18 United Nations peacekeeping operations on four continents.

But I am far from complacent about the United Nations today.Just as America has had to struggle, throughout its history, to move ever closer to the ideals declared by its founders, so too the United Nations is a work in progress. If we are to keep alive the idea that gave birth to the Organization, and pass it on healthy and strong to your generation, we must make sure that the United Nations moves with the times.

That is why I have put before the Member States, for their decision, a blueprint called “In larger freedom” for a truly overhauled United Nations, set up to meet the challenges of the 21st
century.

The United Nations must live up to the highest standards of integrity and accountability—and I am committed to ensuring that it does.

But the major reform decisions rest with the Member States. The reform agenda includes a clear stand against terrorism, a tighter regime to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, more support for democracies, and better peacekeeping and humanitarian capacities. It also calls for an urgent boost in resources from rich nations to cut world poverty in half within the next ten years, and a new human rights body at the United Nations to focus on the implementation of all human rights in all countries.

These changes would not solve all the world’s problems. Nor would they make the United Nations perfect. But they would make the UN much more effective in advancing the cause of larger freedom around the world.

World leaders are going to meet in New York in four months time to take up these proposals. If they can work together to make far-reaching reforms, they will help bequeath to your generation a United Nations that can carry forward the ideals for which your grandparents sacrificed so much six decades ago.

And I trust that, when it is your turn to lead,

you will improve on what my generation has done. Do not think you can look away from the injustice, the suffering, or the lack of true freedom that is the lot of so many people in our world today. Your future depends on their future. The cause of larger freedom should be your cause. As I look at you today, with all your talent, your diversity, your commitment, and your optimism, I have no doubt that you will do your part to help make it come about.

Congratulations, and good luck to you all.

I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots.

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

My third story is about death.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

Thank you all very much.

It is an honor to stand before you this morning – you the class of 2005. I’ve been a journalist all my life. It’s been a great ride. And what I thought I would talk with you about today is not the stories I’ve covered but some of the lessons I accidentally learned along the way about getting through life. As Yogi Berra once said, “You can see a lot by just listening,” or maybe it was “You can hear a lot just by watching.” Either way, the reporter’s life has allowed me to do a lot of both, and for the past few months I’ve been jotting down a few of the things that might be relevant advice to you all on graduation day.

Lesson #1 is very simple. As the writer Dan Pink noted in New York Times just yesterday, it is a piece of advice that graduation speakers all over the land will be giving to graduates today, and it goes like this: Do what you love. But the reason that advice is no longer, what Pink called “warm and gooey career advice’” but actually a very “hard-headed’” survival strategy, is because, as I like to put it, the world is getting flat. Yes, mom and dad, you have paid tens of thousands of dollars to have your child get a Williams education only to have their graduation speaker declare on their last day on campus that the world is flat.
What is flattening the world is our ability to automate more work with computers and software and to transmit that work anywhere in the world that it can be done more efficiently or cheaply thanks to the new global fiber optic network. The flatter the world gets, the more essential it is that you do what you love, because, as Pink notes, all the boring, repetitive jobs are going to be automated or outsourced in a flat world. The good jobs that will remain will be those that cannot be automated or outsourced; they will be the jobs that demand or encourage some uniquely human creative flair, passion and imagination. In other words, jobs that can only be done by people who love what they do.

You see, when the world gets flat everyone should want to be an untouchable. Untouchables in my lexicon are people whose jobs cannot be outsourced or automated. They cannot be shipped to India or done by a machine. So who are the untouchables? Well, first they are people who are really special – Michael Jordan or Barbra Streisand. Their talents can never be automated or outsourced. Second are people who are really specialized – brain surgeons, designers, consultants or artists. Third are people who are anchored and whose jobs have to be done in a specific location – from nurses to hairdressers to chefs – and lastly, and this is going to apply to many of us, people who are really adaptable – people can change with changing times and changing industries.

There is a much better chance that you will make yourself special, specialized or adaptable, a much better chance that you will bring that something extra, what Dan Pink called “a sense of curiosity, aesthetics, and joyfulness’” to your work, if do you what you love and love what you do.

I learned that quite by accident by becoming a journalist. It all started when I was in 10th grade. First, I took a journalism class from a legendary teacher at my high school, named Hattie Steinberg, who had more influence on me than any adult other than my parents. Under Hattie’s inspiration, journalism just grabbed my imagination. Hattie was a single woman nearing 60 years old by the time I had her as a teacher. She was the polar opposite of cool. But she sure got us all excited about writing, and we hung around her classroom like it was the malt shop and she was the disc jockey “Wolfman Jack.” To this day, her 10th grade journalism class in Room 313 was the only journalism class I have ever taken. The other thing that happened to me in 10th grade, though, was that my parents took me to Israel over the Christmas break. And from that moment on I fell in love with the Middle East. One of the first articles I ever published in my Minnesota high school paper was in 10th grade, in 1969. It was an interview with an Israeli general who had been a major figure in the ‘67 war. He had come to give a lecture at the University of Minnesota; his name was Ariel Sharon. Little did I know how many times our paths would cross in the years to come.

Anyway, by the time 10th grade was over, I still wasn’t quite sure what career I wanted, but I sure knew what I loved: I loved journalism and I loved the Middle East. Now growing up in Minnesota at that time, in a middle-class household, I never thought about going away to college. Like all my friends, I enrolled at the University of Minnesota. But unlike my friends, I decided to major in Arabic and Middle Eastern studies. There were not a lot of kids at the University of Minnesota studying Arabic back then. Norwegian, yes; Swedish, yes; Arabic, no. But I loved it; my parents didn’t mind; they could see I enjoyed it. But if I had a dime for every time one of my parents’ friends said to me, “Say Tom, your Dad says you’re studying Arabic; what are you going to do with that?” Well, frankly, it beat the heck out of me. But this was what I loved and it just seemed that that was what college was for.

I eventually graduated from Brandeis with a degree in Mediterranean studies and went onto graduate school at Oxford. During my first year in England – this was 1975 – I was walking down the street with my then-girlfriend and now-wife, Ann, and I noticed a front-page headline from the Evening Standard tabloid. It said, “President Carter to Jews: If Elected I Promise to Fire Dr. K.” I thought, “Isn’t that interesting?” Jimmy Carter is running against Gerald Ford for president, and in order to get elected, he’s trying to win Jewish votes by promising to fire the first-ever Jewish Secretary of State. I thought about how odd that was and what might be behind it. And for some reason, I went back to my dorm room in London and wrote a short essay about it. No one asked me to, I just did it. Well, my then-girlfriend, now-wife’s family knew the editorial-page editor of the Des Moines Register, and my then-girlfriend, now-wife brought the article over to him when she was home for spring break. He liked it, printed it, and paid me $50 for it. And I thought that was the coolest thing in the whole world. I was walking down the street, I had an idea, I wrote it down, and someone gave me $50. I’ve been hooked ever since. A journalist was born and I never looked back.

So whatever you plan to do, whether you plan to travel the world next year, go to graduate school, join the workforce, or take some time off to think, don’t just listen to your head. Listen to your heart. It’s the best career counselor there is. Do what you really love to do and if you don’t know quite what that is yet, well, keep searching, because if you find it, you’ll bring that something extra to your work that will help ensure you will not be automated or outsourced. It help make you an untouchable radiologist, an untouchable engineer, or an untouchable teacher.

Indeed, let me close this point with a toned down version of a poem that was written by the slam poet Taylor Mali. A friend sent it to my wife, who’s a schoolteacher. It is called: “What Teachers Make.” It contains some wisdom that I think belongs in every graduation speech. It goes like this: “The dinner guests were sitting around the table discussing life. One man, a CEO, decided to explain the problem with education. He argued this way. ‘What’s a kid going to learn from someone who decided his best option in life was to become a teacher? You know, it’s true what they say about teachers: ‘Those who can do, do; those who can’t do, teach.’ To corroborate his statement he said to another guest, ‘Hey, Susan, you’re a teacher. Be honest, what do you make?’

“Susan, who had a reputation for honesty and frankness, replied, ‘You want to know what I make? I make kids work harder than they ever thought they could and I can make kids sit through 40 minutes of study hall in absolute silence. I can make a C-plus feel like the Congressional Medal of Honor and an A feel like a slap in the face if the student didn’t do his or her very best.’ Susan continued, ‘I can make parents tremble when I call home or feel almost like they won the lottery when I tell them how well their child is progressing.’ Gaining speed, she went on: ‘You want to know what I make? I make kids wonder, I make them question, I make them criticize, I make them apologize and mean it, I make them write and I make them read, read, read. I make them show all their work in math and hide it all on their final drafts in English.’ Susan then stopped and cleared her throat. ‘I make them understand that if you have the brains, then follow your heart. And if someone ever tries to judge you by what you make in money, you pay them no attention.’ Susan then paused. ‘You want to know what I make?’ she said. ‘I make a difference. What about you?’”

Lesson #2. The second lesson I learned from journalim is that being a good listener is one of the great keys to life. My friend and colleague, Bob Schieffer of CBS News used to say to me, “The biggest stories I missed as a journalist happened because I was talking when I should have been listening.” The ability to be a good listener is one of the most under-appreciated talents a person or a country can have. People often ask me how I, an American Jew, have been able operate in the Arab/Muslim world for 20 years, and my answer to them is always the same. The secret is to be a good listener. It has never failed me. You can get away with really disagreeing with people as long as you show them the respect of really listening to what they have to say and taking it into account when and if it makes sense. Indeed, the most important part of listening is that it is a sign of respect. It’s not just what you hear by listening that is important. It is what you say by listening that is important. It’s amazing how you can diffuse a whole roomful of angry people by just starting your answer to a question with the phrase, “You’re making a legitimate point” or “I hear what you say” and really meaning it. Never underestimate how much people just want to feel that they have been heard, and once you have given them that chance they will hear you.

I went to Saudi Arabia after 9/11 after having written a series of extremely critical columns about the Saudi regime. And I was always struck by how Saudis received me, Saudis who weren’t prepped to receive me. The encounter would often go something like this:
“Hi, I’m Tom Friedman.”
“The Tom Friedman who writes for The New York Times?”
“Yes, that Tom Friedman.”
“You’re here?”
“Yes, I’m here.”
“They gave you a visa?”
“Yes, I didn’t come illegally.”
“You know, I hate everything you write. Would you come to my house for dinner so I could get some friends together to talk to you?”

If you really want to get through to people as a journalist, you first have to open their ears, and the best way to open their ears is to first open your own – show them the respect of listening, it’s amazing what they will let you say after that, and it is amazing what you might learn.

Lesson #3 is that the most enduring skill you can bring to the workplace is also one of the most important skills you always had to bring to reporting – and that is the ability to learn how to learn. I have always thought that the greatest thing about being a reporter was that you just get to keep getting Master’s degrees. Each time I took a new beat, from Beirut to Jerusalem to Diplomacy to the White House to the Treasury I got to get the equivalent of a Master’s degree in each of those subjects – just by reporting on them for an extended period.

So while I hope that you all came out of here with some specialty, I hope even more that you came out of here having learned how to learn. That too is going to be really important if you want to be an untouchable, because jobs are going to change faster and faster in a flat world. Believe me, I know. You see, about 18 months ago I went to Bangalore, India to do a documentary about outsourcing. We shot about 60 hours of film in ten days, and across those ten days I got progressively sicker and sicker. Because somewhere between the Indian entrepreneur who wanted to do my taxes from Bangalore, and the one who wanted to write my new software from Bangalore and one who wanted to read my X-rays from Bangalore, and the one who wanted to trace my lost luggage on Delta airlines from Bangalore, I realized that people were doing things I could not explain or understand. I realized that my own intellectual software needed updating. I came home and told my editors I need to go on leave immediately. That is why I wrote “The World is Flat.” I was retooling myself. None of us is immune from that.

Now, while I have been on book tour these few months talking about the flat world, several parents have come up to me and said, “Mr. Friedman, my daughter is studying Chinese, she’s going to be OK, right?” As if this was going to be the new key to lifetime employment.
Well, not exactly. I think it is great to study Chinese, I told them, but the enduring skill you really need in a flat world is an ability to learn how to learn. The ability to learn how to learn is what enables you to adapt and stay special or specialized. Well then, a ninth grader in St. Paul asked me, how do you learn how to learn?

“Wow,” I said to him, “that’s a really good question.” I told him that I think the best way to learn how to learn is to go around and ask all your friends who are the best teachers in your school and then just take their classes, whether it is Greek Mythology or physics. Because I think probably the best way to learn how to learn is to love learning. When I think back on my favorite teachers, I am not sure I remember much anymore of what they taught me, but I sure remember enjoying learning it.

Lesson #4 is: Don’t get carried away with the gadgets. I started as a reporter in Beirut working on an Adler manual typewriter. I can tell you that the stories I wrote for the New York Times on that manual typewriter are still some of my favorites. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not about the skis. In this age of laptops and PDAs, the Internet and Google, mp3s and iPods, remember one thing: all these tools might make you smarter, but they sure won’t make you smart, they might extend your reach, but they will never tell you what to say to your neighbor over the fence, or how to comfort a friend in need, or how to write a lead that sings or how to imagine a breakthrough in science or literature. You cannot download passion, imagination, zest and creativity – all that stuff that will make you untouchable. You have to upload it, the old fashioned way, under the olive tree, with reading, writing and arithmetic, travel, study, reflection, museum visits and human interaction.

Look, no one is more interested in technology than I am, but the rumor is true: I was the last person in my family and on my block to get a mobile phone, and I still only use it for outgoing calls. Otherwise, as my daughters will tell you, I never keep it on. And don’t leave me a message, because I still don’t know how to retrieve them and I have no intention of learning. Because I can’t concentrate if people are constantly pinging me. You may also have noticed, I do not put my email address on my column. Unless readers go through all the trouble to call the paper to get my web address, if they want to communicate with me, they have to sit down and write me a letter. That is mail without an “e.” And yes, I only converted to Microsoft Word when I started my latest book a year ago and that is because Xywrite, the stone-age writing program I have been using since the 1980s, just couldn’t interface anymore with my new laptop. I am not a Luddite, per se, but I am a deliberately late adopter. I prefer to keep my tools simple, so I focus as much of my energy on the listening, writing and problem solving – not on the gadgets. That is also why if I had one fervent wish it would be that every modem sold in America would come with a warning label from the surgeon general, and that warning would simply say: “Judgment Not Included.”

Lesson #5 is this: Always remember, there is a difference between skepticism and cynicism. Too many journalists, and too many of our politicians, have lost sight of that boundary line. I learned that lesson very early in my career. In 1982, I was working in the Business section of The Times and was befriended by a young editor there named Nathaniel Nash. Nathaniel was a gentle soul and a born again Christian. He liked to come by and talk to me about Israel and the Holyland. In April 1982, The Times assigned me to cover the Lebanese civil war, and at my office goodbye party Nathaniel whispered to me: “I’m going to pray for your safety.” I never forgot that. I always considered his prayers my good luck charm, and when I walked out of Beirut in one piece three years later, one of the first things I did was thank Nathaniel for keeping watch over me. He liked that a lot.

I only wish I could have returned the favor. You see a few years later Nathaniel gave up editing and became a reporter himself, first in Argentina and then later as the Times business reporter in Europe, based in Germany. Nathaniel was a wonderful reporter, who was one of the most un-cynical people I ever knew. Indeed, the book on Nathaniel as a reporter was that he was too nice. His colleagues always doubted that anyone that nice could ever succeed in journalism, but somehow he triumphed over this handicap and went from one successful assignment to another. It was because Nathaniel intuitively understood that there was a big difference between skepticism and cynicism. Skepticism is about asking questions, being dubious, being wary, not being gullible, but always being open to being persuaded of a new fact or angle. Cynicism is about already having the answers – or thinking you do – answers about a person or an event. The skeptic says, “I don’t think that’s true; I’m going to check it out.” The cynic says: “I know that’s not true. It couldn’t be. I’m going to slam him.” Nathaniel always honored that line.

Unfortunately, Nathaniel Nash, at age 44, was the sole American reporter traveling on U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown’s airplane when it crashed into a Croatian hillside in 1996. Always remember, real journalists are not those loud mouth talking heads you see on cable television. Real journalists are reporters, like Nathaniel Nash, who go off to uncomfortable and often dangerous places like Croatia and get on a military plane to chase after a visiting dignitary, without giving it a second thought – all to get a few fresh quotes, maybe a scoop, or even just a paragraph of color that no one else had. My prayers were too late for Nathaniel, but he was such a good soul, I am certain that right now he is sitting at God’s elbow – taking notes, with skepticism not cynicism. So be a skeptic, not a cynic. We have more than enough of those in our country already, and so much more creative juice comes from skepticism, not cynicism.

Lesson #6. Nathaniel’s untimely death only reinforced for me the final lesson I am going to impart to you this afternoon. It’s very brief. It’s “Call Your Mama.” For me, the most searing images and stories of 9/11 were the tales of all those people who managed to use a cell phone to call their loved ones to say a last goodbye from a hijacked airplane or a burning tower. But think of the hundreds of others who never got a chance to say goodbye or a final “I love you.”
When you were just in elementary school there was a legendary football coach at the University of Alabama named Bear Bryant. And late in his career, after his mother had died, Bell South Telephone Company asked Bear Bryant to do a TV commercial. As best I can piece together from the news reports, the commercial was supposed to be very simple – just a little music and Coach Bryant saying in his tough coach’s voice, “Have you called your Mama today?” On the day of the filming, though, when it came time for Coach Bryant to recite his simple line, he decided to ad lib something. He looked into the camera and said, “Have you called your Mama today? I sure wish I could call mine.” That was how the commercial ran, and it got a huge response from audiences. My father died when I was 19. He never got to see me do what I love. I sure wish I could call him. My mom is 86 years old and lives in a home for people with dementia. She doesn’t remember so well anymore, but she still remembers that my column runs twice a week. She doesn’t quite remember the days, so every day she goes through The New York Times, and if she finds my column, she often photocopies it and passes it out to the other dementia patients in her nursery home. If you think that isn’t important to me than you don’t know what is important.

Your parents love you more than you will ever know. So if you take one lesson away from this talk, take this one: Call your Mama, regularly. And your Papa. You will always be glad you did.

Well, class of 2005, that about does it for me. I’m fresh out of material. I guess what I have been trying to say here this afternoon can be summed up by the old adage that “happiness is a journey, not a destination.” Bringing joy and passion and optimism to your work is not what you get to do when you get to the top. It is HOW you get to the top. If I have had any success as a journalist since I was sitting down there where you are 30 years ago, it’s because I found a way to enjoy the journey as much as the destination. I had almost as much fun as a cub reporter doing the overnight shift at UPI, as I did traveling with Secretary of State Baker, as I do now as a columnist. Oh yes, I have had my dull moments and bad seasons – believe me, I have. But more often than not I found ways to learn from, and enjoy, some part of each job. You can’t bet your whole life on some destination. You’ve got to make the journey work too. And that is why I leave you with some wit and wisdom attributed to Mark Twain: Always work like you don’t need the money. Always fall in love like you’ve never been hurt. Always dance like nobody is watching. And always – always – live like it’s heaven on earth.


Thank you.

To everyone out there this morning, I’ve got a promise to keep.  As King Henry VIII said to each of his seven wives, “I won’t keep you long.”

I’m here not to talk about the rest of your life, that’s too far to see, just the next few years?your early and middle twenties.

I’ve got three bits of advice?all learned the hard way.

“If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man,” Ernest Hemingway wrote later in his life, “then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.”

Hemingway was writing of the twenties in Paris. 

My “Moveable Feast” was the ’60s in Africa.

For two years, between the ages of 23 and 25, I spent a good part of my time riding the dirt roads of remote Swaziland on a Suzuki 120 motorbike teaching a couple hundred African traders how to be better businessmen.

In my more romantic moments, I saw myself as an American Che Guevara, long before I knew about Motorcycle Diaries.  He was selling revolution and communism in South America.  I was teaching bookkeeping and selling capitalism in Southern Africa.

I did some other things I wouldn’t have expected to be doing?ever?like hitchhiking on my own up through East Africa through Mozambique and what was then Rhodesia and Tanzania, once taking a 26-hour local bus ride?with chickens and goats, and then one time, surviving the attack of a black mamba?the snake that goes at 30 miles per hour and whose venom attacks your nervous system, and came within a whisker of jumping in my car, and also I remember falling in love with Indian Ocean port cities, from Lurrenco Marques and Dar Esalaam in Mombasa.

I wasn’t alone in the Peace Corps.  There were some really good guys, mostly guys, with me in the Peace Corps back then, from Ivy Leaguers to the minimally collegiate.  One guy from San Francisco was posted as speechwriter for the foreign minister; another lawyer to codify the laws of Swaziland, four of us as “trade development and advisors”?I loved that title!!!

I was driven to my assignment personally by the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Mines, Simon Nxumalo, who gave me two instructions as we got out of the car: develop the province economically and “don’t eat at the hotel.”  I guess he had a bad memory of the colonial times, which had just ended two months before.

A few days later my roommate, Cliff Sears, an architect from Chicago arrived with none of my Catholic school obedience training.  “We’re eating at the hotel tonight.”

As I said, I served in the Peace Corps with a lot of good people.  They did their jobs, took them seriously.  A few of us?not me!?were maddeningly good at the language?Siswati is similar to Zulu?and some were even more maddeningly perfect as PC volunteers?but there were few sticklers.  We broke rules.  The South African Apartheid government wouldn’t let us enter their country, which surrounded Swaziland on three sides.  They were smart.  One tough guy from Bayonne was arrested and pistol-whipped during training for refusing to leave a backcountry Louisiana bar by a guy who owned the place, ran it in true Jim Crow fashion only for blacks and doubled, my friend discovered?as deputy sheriff. 

The Swazi traders I was sent to teach, who were all older than me, treated me like a son, always insisting I take a Coke on those hot days, a “cold drink”?even if there was no way to make it cold.

And the memories of that remain. Most of all?Swaziland?each day that turns brisk and clear?or when it rains warm?Kathy hears me say “Swazi weather!!”

There are three goals in the Peace Corps you’re told up front: help develop the country, represent our country positively, come home with knowledge of the host country.

I learned that the Swazis were just as proud of their country as we are; and not to mess in their politics; a guy got kicked out for a barroom conversation; a Swazi friend of mine warned me never again to joke about being in the CIA; he thought the Pope was in London, but he knew about the CIA!!

I learned what it’s like to be an American in a time when the world bore no grudge; the kid in Zanzibar who thought America was heaven; the street kids in Cairo who knew John Wayne, and told me not to say anything bad about Muhammed Ali.

I was in a room with 17 guys, and I realized I was the only white guy—the only American. This is what it’s like to be in the Peace Corps: you forget the differences.

It is one thing to leave your country?to get away; better yet, to live life of the road?the youth hostels, the local cigarettes, the trading in knowledge with others on the road.  It’s still another to go to a country and to get into it, to get in with the people.  That is what, I think, I did, not as well as some guys, but what I could do.

And if I hadn’t driven into all those villages in Africa as a stranger on my Suzuki motorbike, I doubt that I would be doing what I did all these years. It was a rite of passage. Nothing like Churchill escaping the Boers or Hemingway getting blown apart as an ambulance driver in World War I or Jack Kennedy saving his crew in the South Pacific.

But it got me out of one world and into another.  I got off the track, the rut I was on.  The great irony of my life is that, when faced to make a decision, it freed me into a larger world.

My grandmother, who had come to America from Northern Ireland as a young working girl looked into my eyes years later, after I’d come back from Africa. “It was Africa,” she said sure of the answer, “wasn’t it.”

I did things in Africa that I’d be scared for my kids to do?but I know I can never give them the memories they can and will earn for themselves.

That’s my first advice to you: do something wild and good and crazy while you still have a chance. Listen to this one minute—this is about life. Today’s Rule One: Get Yourself In The Game!

Ever watch a little kid standing alone courtside while the big kids play basketball?  When a ball goes out of bounds, he runs for it and passes it back in.  And as time goes on, when an older kid has to get home for dinner, somebody yells, “Hey punk, wanna play?”

That’s the heart of it there:  If you want to play a game, go to where it’s played and find a way to get in.

Things happen when you get in the game:

You learn how the game is played but also how the players act with each other.  You learn the game’s manner, the cadence of the game, the culture, its lingo.

You also meet people.  It’s not who you know; let’s face it, it’s who you get to know.

And here’s the big one: if you’re in the game, you’re there when lightening strikes.  Again, find a way to get in the game.  Hollywood is filled with big time producers who started in the mailroom.

Third and final bit of advice: Ask! There should be a course at Fordham, chutzpah: the guts to ask.

When I got out of the Peace Corps in Africa, I traveled up through East Africa, spent some time in Israel, Egypt, then England.   When I ran out of money I came home and headed to Washington.  I’d been interested in politics as long as I could remember.  It seemed like something I could do.

I think I knocked on 200 doors of senators and members of congress. 

Got an interview with a hardnosed right-winger, I suppose.  Didn’t like my “hair style”?too long?or the way I talked?too fast.   He also said that the folks in his district might think I’d gotten a little “idealistic” over there in Africa.  He said the word “idealistic” as if it were an infection, but he gave me encouragement.

Politics, he said, is like selling insurance door to door, what he’d done himself before running for Congress.

You visit ten families.  Three invite you back to meet the husband or the spouse.  One buys a policy.

You don’t get that one sale without the three direct pitches.  You don’t get to make the three pitches without first making the ten visits door-to-door.

Keep trying, this congressman said.  “I’m sure somebody will like someone with “your background.”

Finally, I got to the magic door.  A top aide to a Utah Senator had worked for both Robert and Ted Kennedy.  He loved the fact I’d been in the Peace Corps, he loved that I’d majored in economics; that I was a Catholic from Massachusetts was even better—he was a Mormon.

He offered me a job: working during the day in the office answering the more important mail, writing short speeches, and then moonlighting at night as an armed Capitol policeman.  That was where the salary came from.  That’s the way the old patronage system worked in those days.

“It’ll pay for the groceries,” Wayne said trying to brighten the offer.

Within three months, I asked him for and he gave me my first full-time job working as the senator’s legislative assistant. 

“If you knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are bound to wake up somebody,”  said Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

You might have noticed by now that some people aren’t going to like the cut of your jib.  But those who do will change your life. They will open doors for you.  So if nine people when you’re out looking for a job say “No” to you, then ask ten.

It’s like dating.

It takes only one strike to transform a prospector into a gold miner, only one “Yes” to turn a proposal into a marriage.

And here’s the bonus?there is magic that results when a person says “yes” to you, when anybody says “yes” to you.

Because, when you ask someone for help, you are really asking him to place a big-time bet on you.  If you know that, you know a lot.

“If you want to make a friend,” said Benjamin Franklin, a fellow who grows wiser the older I get, “let someone do you a favor.”

How’d I get the TV job?

Ten years ago, I was giving an interview to a guy who’d gone to Holy Cross, Joe McGinnis, a writer, at The Grill, a hang-out in Beverly Hills.   He told me he was having drinks afterward over at the Four Seasons with some guy he thought I would hit it off with. A few years later, that guy he had introduced me to?Roger Ailes?gave me my first TV job.

That’s how it works.  You get a job.  You make contacts.  You move to the next one.   You hustle!

There’s a false assumption out there that talent will surely be recognized.  Just get good at something and the world will beat a path to your door. 

Don’t believe it.  The world is not checking in with us to see what skills we’ve picked up, what idea we’ve concocted, what dreams we carry in our hearts. 

When a job opens, whether it’s in the chorus line or on the assembly line, it goes to the person standing there.  It goes to the eager beaver the boss sees when he looks up from his work: the pint-sized kid standing at the basketball court on the playground waiting for one of the older boys to head home.  “Hey, kid, wanna play?”

I think my greatest moment as a journalist was in East Berlin that drizzly night in November 1989,  when the Berlin wall started to come down.  I stood in a crowd of people waiting on the eastern side of the Brandenburg Gate and I organized a little rump room of “Hardball,” even before there was a “Hardball.” I decided to ask the crowd of East Germans who had lived their whole lives without it - what “freedom” meant to them.  “Was ist Freiheit?”  What is freedom? I kept asking everybody in the room, outside in the rain.  Finally, a young man in his twenties looked me solemnly in the eye and said, “Talking to you.”

Don’t think I’m gonna forget that.  I make my living, as Father McShane said, proving what freedom we have in this country: free speech, free press, the works!

So get whatever education you need?but also that thing called “experience,” the adventure and good work and shared humanity of the Jesuit volunteers, or the Peace Corps or whatever else gets you out there, and the memories, believe me, that come with it--your personal moveable feast.

Whatever you do in your 20s will have a lot to do with who you become and what in those late nights in life, you get to remember, to savor, to embrace, to love.

So go out and do something wild and good: get in the game, be quick to ask for help, and most important, be true to your ideals, which you’ve come to hone and grasp while here at Fordham University, starting and ending with the ideal you hold of yourself. 

Chancellor, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, members of the distinguished faculty, families, parents, grandparents and friends, and especially, of course, the graduating class:

I congratulate you together with my other fellow recipients of the honorary degree. What you have learned here should not stay only in memory, but you must open the gates of your own memory and try to do something with what you have learned.

I speak to you, of course, not only as a teacher, but also as a witness. And therefore I must maybe define myself. You should know that I am Jewish. Maybe you don’t know it. But to me, to be Jewish is what? It’s not exclusive — it’s an opening. It is really as when the conductor here conducts his orchestra; he offers the person to sing or to play a certain part, a certain tune. And I offer my memory to you. You should know something about what is there, inside.

But what I say, that a Jew, the more Jewish he or she is, and the more universal is the message, I say that anyone else could say the same thing, whether as Protestant, Unitarian, Catholic, Buddhist or even agnostic. We must be before we give. We must shield and protect the identity, the inner identity that we have and that makes us who we are.

Now, the topic is memory. In the Bible, the expression is “Remember, don’t forget.” And when you study the text, you realize there is something wrong there. It’s enough to say, “remember.” Or it’s enough to say, “don’t forget.” Why the repetition? It could mean, “Remember not to forget.” It could also mean, “Don’t forget to remember.” I say that knowing one thing: that this is a very great university. I have been here before you were born, most of you. I have been here some 35 years ago or so. And so humbly I realize that it took the leaders of this university 35 years to invite me again.

Now, a story. A man is lost in the forest. And he tries to find the exit and fails. It takes him hours in night and day, and he’s still lost in the forest. On the third day, he notices that someone else is in the forest. He runs to him and he says, “Ah! I’m so glad to meet you. Show me the way out.” And he said, “I am like you — I am lost in the forest. One thing I can tell you: You see that road there? Don’t go there. I have just come from there.”

I belong to a generation that tells you that. Where you now can start your life, and you’ve of course entered a lot of roads, cities, maybe new universities, and remember, there is something that you must remember: Don’t go where I come from.

The 20th century was one of the worst centuries in the history of humankind. Why? Because it was dominated by two fanaticisms. Political fanaticism: capital, Moscow. Racist fanaticism: capital, Berlin. And therefore, that century has caused more deaths than any time before.

What do we know now? A new trend is hanging upon us, and the name is fanaticism. We must do whatever we can to, first of all, unmask. Second, to denounce. And, of course, to oppose fanaticism wherever it is. What is fanaticism? Perversion. You can take a beautiful idea — like religion in the Middle Ages — but fanaticism can turn it into something which is anti-human because a group of human beings decide that they know who is worthy of life, who is worthy of redemption.

And today, fanaticism has reached an even lower point in its development: the fanatic who becomes a suicide murderer. That is a kind of atomic bomb. A suicide murderer who becomes himself, and, in some cases, herself, a weapon! They do not want simply to die. For that, they could simply jump into the ocean. They want to kill innocent people mainly, including children, and therefore that is an option that you must resist in your own life.

What else have we learned? That we are not alone in this world. God alone is alone. Human beings are not. We are here to be together with others, and I insist on the others — which means, in some places, in some groups, they are suspicious of the other. Don’t. I see the otherness of the other, which appeals to me. In fact it is the otherness of the other that makes me who I am. I am always to learn from the other. And the other is, to me, not an enemy, but a companion, an ally, and of course, in some cases of grace, a friend. So the other is never to be rejected, and surely not humiliated.

What else? I quote from the Bible, I continue, because after all that is my study — that’s my upbringing. The greatest commandment, to me, in the Bible is not the Ten Commandments. First of all, it’s too difficult to observe. Second, we all pretend to observe them. My commandment is, “Thou shall not stand idly by.” Which means when you witness an injustice, don’t stand idly by. When you hear of a person or a group being persecuted, do not stand idly by. When there is something wrong in the community around you — or far way — do not stand idly by. You must intervene. You must interfere. And that is actually the motto of human rights. Human rights has become a kind of secular religion today. And I applaud it — I am part of it. And therefore wherever something happens, I try to be there as a witness.

One of my last dramatic visits was to Bosnia. I was sent by President Clinton as a Presidential Envoy. And I would go there, really, to those places in Bosnia, to speak with the victims. My interest is in the victims. And I would go literally from person to person, from family to family, from barrack to barrack, from tent to tent, asking them to tell me their stories. And they always began, but they stopped in the middle. Not one of the people I interviewed or interrogated ended the story. The story was usually about rape in the family, and murder, they were tortured, there was humiliation — no one finished the story! Because they all burst into tears.

And then I realized. Maybe that is my mission, as a teacher, as a witness: to finish the story for them. Because they were crying and crying and crying. And I felt like the prophet Elijah, when I sat down in private to do what I had to do. I said I’m going to collect their tears, and turn them into stories.

Now, you have already known something which I did not before I came here. This university is great not only because of its great faculty and its marvelous students, but also because it has a tradition. The commencement speaker should speak only for 15 minutes. I am sure they meant well because they felt sorry for you, graduates. You are waiting here patiently for the moment when the Chancellor will come and offer you the degree. So why should I expose you to torture, the torture of waiting?

I want you to know, with all that I have gone through in life: I still have faith in humanity. I still have faith in humanity. I have faith in language, although language was perverted by the enemy. I have faith in God, although I quarrel with Him a lot of time. I don’t know whether he feels upset or not, but I do. Why? Because I don’t want to break the chain that links me to my parents and grandparents and theirs, and theirs, and theirs.

And furthermore, I believe that the human being — any human being of any community, any origin, any color — a human being is eternal. Any human being is a challenge. Any human being is worthy of my attention, of my love occasionally. And therefore I say it to you: When you are now going into a world which is hounded, obsessed with so much violence, often so much despair — when you enter this world and you say the world is not good today, good! Correct it! That’s what you have learned here for four years from your great teachers. Go there, and tell them what you remember. Tell them that the nobility of the human being cannot be denied.

I’m sure you have learned French literature. I’m sure you have learned about Albert Camus, the great philosopher and novelist. In his famous novel, The Plague, at the end Dr. Rieux, who was the main character of the novel, sees a devastated city, thousands and thousands of victims from the plague. And this doctor at the end says, it’s true, all that is true.

But nevertheless, I believe, he said, there is more in any human being to celebrate than to denigrate. I repeat: There is more in any human being to celebrate than to denigrate.

Let’s celebrate. Thank you.

My fellow graduates, I’ve got the best seat in the house today, a view of the greatest hearts, minds and talents of this generation. You will undoubtedly hear a lot of that kind of talk here today. There are sayings like “the intellectual elite” or “the hope for this country’s future” or “the responsibility that comes with the privilege of education.” And if you’re anything like I was at my Yale graduation in 1984, you’ll think, what a load of elitist crap. You’ll look around you, at your friends still bleary eyed and silly from last night’s concoctions, the buddies you curl up with, sing stupid songs with, make faces with. These guys? We can’t possibly be the ones they’re talking about…Do we know where we’re going? Hell no! If you’re anything like I was you’ll spend the next six months in bed watching re-runs feeling like a complete idiot.

But somewhere in the middle of free form post-graduation survival, the journey of your life has a way of sneaking off the starting line. That is when your Penn education starts peeking through. You have been given the promise of meaningfulness. You’ve learned the discipline to “just do it,” to apply yourself and lay your guts on the line. You have been inspired and not just by the things you have learned here. (Let’s face it. You won’t remember a single test question in a few months.) You have been inspired by the experiences you have had, the people you’ve held, the blood you have shed, all the growing up surrounded by hopefulness of spirit. You have dared, have stuck your hands in the surf and come up with dripping substance. All of that fine and delicious matter has a way of becoming the material of your life. You pick up bits and pieces of treasure and trash, pain and pleasure, passions and disappointments and you start stuffing them in your bag…your big bag of experience. You do some dumb things that don’t work out at all. You stumble excitedly on little gems that you never saw coming. And you stuff them all in your bag. You pursue the things you love and believe in. You cast off the images of yourself that don’t fit. And suddenly you look behind you and a pattern emerges. You look in front of you and the path makes sense. There is nothing more beautiful than finding your course as you believe you bob aimlessly in the current. Wouldn’t you know that your path was there all along, waiting for you to knock, waiting for you to become. This path does not belong to your parents, your teachers, your leaders, or your lovers. Your path is your character defining itself more and more everyday like a photograph coming into focus, like a color that becomes more vivid in contrast with its surroundings. And who is this shiny penny rolling towards that bright future, our graduating cliché? Is he or she so shiny? Is the future truly bright? Well, that is only for you to know and for you to find out. You are standing on a freeway and things will happen. How you duck, weave and balance, how you push, twist and choose, well, that is up to you.

My freshman fall in 1980 marked the election of Ronald Reagan for his first term in office and the subsequent 12 years we all know too much about. It was also when HIV/AIDS started to touch our landscape. So much sadness and grief became a part of our lives in that time and the years to come. Like my friends, I protested apartheid in South Africa, the CIA’s presence in Central America. I bailed my friends out of jail. I stayed up nights talking, talking, talking, and endlessly poring over the rumination of our consciousness. Finally my graduation procession in 1984 angled through the rainy streets of New Haven, all of the students greeted with smiles and buttons from hundreds of striking and picketing university workers. College campuses stung with the excitement of activism. If only I could find that connection to move our country towards change, to serve. But I was never comfortable being front and center with my political opinions. It just wasn’t me. It wasn’t my way…What was my way? I wanted to be relevant, significant. I wanted my life to be meaningful. All I really loved was to tell stories, to find the hidden truths in the details of people’s lives. Well, what difference could that possibly make? I had no idea at the time how much of a difference it can make. Yes, I tell stories and those stories have changed me, have cut me open and spilled me out and connected me with the world around me in ways I could never have imagined. I have learned so much from them. What I have learned lives on in the food I make, in the way I treat my kids, the laws I uphold, the hand I outstretch, the rituals I cling to and pass along. Like the characters I have played, those women who endure terrible adversity and survive intact, victorious, heroic, I want to become better instead of worse, deeper, stronger, more truthful. With every choice I make in my lifetime I come a little closer to that goal. And perhaps in the process other women will be inspired by these portrayals to do the same. This is my way. How could I have possibly known that my freshman year in college?

I’m sure all of you remember your freshman year of 2002. On the anniversary of the worst September in our nation’s history we were all glued to those burning buildings, the screaming confusion, the fiery chaos of the 9/11 attacks set against a painful drumbeat for war. And there were the stories, the immigrant window washer working on the Twin Towers that day. How he’d had breakfast that morning with one of those happy grins. “It’s going to be sunny.” The preschoolers holding hands as they were hurried down Greenwich Street away from the explosions. The teachers would shout, “If you see their parents tell them they’re okay.” Firemen climbing up, climbing up into the smoke of fear as the world we’d come to believe in crumbled below them. Grief, unending grief, too hard for one nation to bear. And in that one instant of deep sorrowful mourning the world was with us. We reached out our arms as the world reached out its arms. A terrible moment.A moment of wonder. A moment so true and so beautiful and so exquisitely sad, one that we shared with humankind…And then the moment was gone, in my belief, squandered. So many lives lost, for what? And where are we now? Your senior year witnessed the terrible wake of Hurricane Katrina, a mark so devastating on our country that words just cannot describe. (Not just the natural disaster but our leader’s equally disastrous and shameful reaction.) How do you live down that mark, a scar that will haunt America and the fabric of its communities for decades to come? No, this country is not better now than it was four years ago. The world is not better now than it was four years ago. That will be part of your story, graduates of the class of 2006. Not your parents’ story, not your teachers’, your friends’, your lovers’ or your leaders’. Where will your story take you? How will your experience pave the way for a new voice in America? I hope it will take you out of these doors, out into the open air. You will breathe it in your lungs and say, “From now on this life will be what I stand for, dammit. Move over. This is my story now.”

You will find on your diplomas, and my diploma, the motto of the University of Pennsylvania, which in Latin reads: “Leges sine moribusvanae.” “Laws without morals are useless.” I would add that morals without commitment are empty. Your Penn education has given you a two-by-four. You may build a building or hit someone over the head. The choice is yours. How lucky to find you have the option of filling your life with your passions. And no, not everyone does. You have the privilege of creating meaning in your life so that others might also come to enjoy that privilege. Do not waste it trying to become someone you’re not. Use it to become who you are already. Class of 2006, I’ll leave you with a quote you all know by heart. Feel free to chime in. I’m going to say it twice. From Eminem:

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment,
You own it. You better never let it go.
One shot! Do not miss your chance to blow.
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Falwell. Thank you, faculty, families and friends, and thank you Liberty University Class of 2006 for your welcome and your kind invitation to give this year’s commencement address. I want to join in the chorus of congratulations to the Class of 2006. This is a day to bask in praise. You’ve earned it. You have succeeded in a demanding course of instruction. Life seems full of promise as is always the case when a passage in life is marked by significant accomplishment. Today, it might seem as if the world attends you.

But spare a moment for those who have truly attended you so well for so long, and whose pride in your accomplishments is even greater than your own -- your parents. When the world was looking elsewhere your parents' attention was one of life’s certainties. So, as I commend you, I offer equal praise to your parents for the sacrifices they made for you, for their confidence in you and their love. More than any other influence in your lives they have helped you -- make you the success you are today and might become tomorrow.

Thousands of commencement addresses are given every year, many by people with greater eloquence and more original minds than I possess. And it’s difficult on such occasions to avoid resorting to clichés. So let me just say that I wish you all well. This is a wonderful time to be young. Life will offer you ways to use your education, industry, and intelligence to achieve personal success in your chosen professions. And it will also offer you chances to know a far more sublime happiness by serving something greater than your self-interest. I hope you make the most of all your opportunities.

When I was in your situation, many, many years ago, an undistinguished graduate -- barely -- of the Naval Academy, I listened to President Eisenhower deliver the commencement address. I admired President Eisenhower greatly. But I must admit I remember little of his remarks that day, impatient as I was to enjoy the less formal celebration of graduation, and mindful that given my class standing I would not have the privilege of shaking the President’s hand. I do recall, vaguely, that he encouraged his audience of new navy ensigns and Marine lieutenants to become "crusaders for peace."

I became an aviator and, eventually, an instrument of war in Vietnam. I believed, as did many of my friends, we were defending the cause of a just peace. Some Americans believed we were agents of American imperialism who were not overly troubled by the many tragedies of war and the difficult moral dilemmas that constantly confront our soldiers. Ours is a noisy, contentious society, and always has been, for we love our liberties much. And among those liberties we love most, particularly so when we are young, is our right to self-expression. That passion for self-expression sometimes overwhelms our civility, and our presumption that those with whom we may have strong disagreements, wrong as they might be, believe that they, too, are answering the demands of their conscience.

When I was a young man, I was quite infatuated with self-expression, and rightly so because, if memory conveniently serves, I was so much more eloquent, well-informed, and wiser than anyone else I knew. It seemed I understood the world and the purpose of life so much more profoundly than most people. I believed that to be especially true with many of my elders, people whose only accomplishment, as far as I could tell, was that they'd been born before me, and, consequently, had suffered some number of years deprived of my insights. I had opinions on everything, and I was always right. I loved to argue, and I could become understandably belligerent with people who lacked the grace and intelligence to agree with me. With my superior qualities so obvious, it was an intolerable hardship to have to suffer fools gladly. So I rarely did. All their resistance to my brilliantly conceived and cogently argued views proved was that they possessed an inferior intellect and a weaker character than God had blessed me with, and I felt it was my clear duty to so inform them. It’s a pity that there wasn’t a blogosphere then. I would have felt very much at home in that medium.

It’s funny, now, how less self-assured I feel late in life than I did when I lived in perpetual springtime. Some of my critics allege that age hasn’t entirely cost me the conceits of my youth. All I can say to them is, they should have known me then, when I was brave and true and better looking than I am at present. But as the great poet, Yeats, wrote, "All that’s beautiful drifts away, like the waters." I've lost some of the attributes that were the object of a young man’s vanity. But there have been compensations, which I have come to hold dear.

We have our disagreements, we Americans. We contend regularly and enthusiastically over many questions: over the size and purposes of our government; over the social responsibilities we accept in accord with the dictates of our consciousness [conscience] and our faithfulness to the God we pray to; over our role in the world and how to defend our security interests and values in places where they are threatened. These are important questions; worth arguing about. We should contend over them with one another. It is more than appropriate: It is necessary that even in times of crisis, especially in times of crisis, we fight among ourselves for the things we believe in. It is not just our right, but our civic and moral obligation.

Our country doesn’t depend on the heroism of every citizen. But all of us should be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf. We have to love our freedom, not just for the private opportunities its [sic] provides, but for the goodness it makes possible. We have to love it as much, even if not as heroically, as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk and often the cost of their lives. We must love it enough to argue about it, and to serve it, in whatever way our abilities permit and our conscience requires, whether it calls us to arms or to altruism or to politics.

I supported the decision to go to war in Iraq. Many Americans did not. My patriotism and my conscience required me to support it and to engage in the debate over whether and how to fight it. I stand that ground not to chase vainglorious dreams of empire; not for a noxious sense of racial superiority over a subject people; not for cheap oil (we could have purchased oil from the former dictator at a price far less expensive than the blood and treasure we’ve paid to secure those resources for the people of that nation); not for the allure of chauvinism, to wreck [wreak] destruction in the world in order to feel superior to it; not for a foolishly romantic conception of war. I stand that ground because I believed, rightly or wrongly, that my country’s interests and values required it.

War is an awful business. The lives of the nation’s finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict. Whether the cause was necessary or not, whether it was just or not, we should all shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. However just or false the cause, how ever proud and noble the service, it is loss -- the loss of friendships, the loss of innocent life, the innocence -- the loss of innocence; and the veteran feels most keenly forever more. Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes war.

Americans should argue about this war. They should argue about it. It has cost the lives of nearly 2500 of the best of us. It has taken innocent life. It has imposed an enormous financial burden on our economy. At a minimum, it has complicated our ability to respond to other looming threats. Should we lose this war, our defeat will be further destabilize an already volatile and dangerous region, strengthen the threat of terrorism, and unleash furies that will assail us for a very long time. I believe the benefits of success will justify the costs and the risks we have incurred. But if an American feels the decision was unwise, then they should state their opposition, and argue for another course. It is your right and your obligation. I respect you for it. I would not respect you if you chose to ignore such an important responsibility. But I ask that you consider the possibility that I, too, am trying to meet my responsibilities, to follow my conscience, to do my duty as best as I can, as God has given me light to see that duty.

Americans deserve more than tolerance from one another; we deserve each other’s respect, whether we think each other right or wrong in our views, as long as our character and our sincerity merit respect, and as long as we share, for all our differences, for all the noisy debates that enliven our politics, a mutual devotion to the sublime idea that this nation was conceived in -- that freedom is the inalienable right of mankind, and in accord with the laws of nature and nature’s Creator.

We have so much more that unites us than divides us. We need only to look to the enemy who now confronts us, and the benighted ideals to which Islamic extremists pledge allegiance -- their disdain for the rights of Man, their contempt for human life -- to appreciate how much unites us.

Take, for example, the awful human catastrophe under way in the Darfur region of the Sudan. If the United States and the West can be criticized for our role in this catastrophe it's because we have waited too long to intervene to protect the multitudes who are suffering, dying because of it.

Twelve years ago, we turned a blind eye to another genocide, in Rwanda. And when that reign of terror finally, mercifully exhausted itself, with over 800,000 Rwandans slaughtered, Americans, our government, and decent people everywhere in the world were shocked and ashamed of our silence and inaction, for ignoring our values, and the demands of our conscience. In shame and renewed allegiance to our ideals, we swore, not for the first time, “never again.” But never lasted only until the tragedy of Darfur.

Now, belatedly, we have recovered our moral sense of duty, and we are prepared, I hope, to put an end to this genocide. Osama bin Laden and his followers, ready, as always, to sacrifice anything and anyone to their hatred of the West and our ideals, have called on Muslims to rise up against any Westerner who dares intervene to stop the genocide, even though Muslims, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, are its victims. Now that, my friends, is a difference, a cause, worth taking up arms against.

It is not a clash of civilizations. I believe, as I hope all Americans would believe, that no matter where people live, no matter their history or religious beliefs or the size of their GDP, all people share the desire to be free; to make by their own choices and industry better lives for themselves and their children. Human rights exist above the state and beyond history -- they are God-given. They cannot be rescinded by one government any more than they can be granted by another. They inhabit the human heart, and from there, though they can be abridged, they can never be wrenched.

This is a clash of ideals, a profound and terrible clash of ideals. It is a fight between right and wrong. Relativism has no place in this confrontation. We're not defending -- We're not defending an idea that every human being should eat corn flakes, play baseball, or watch MTV. We’re not insisting that all societies be governed by a bicameral legislature and a term-limited chief executive. We're insisting that all people have a right to be free, and that right is not subject to the whims and interests and authority of another person, government, or culture. Relativism, in this contest, is most certainly not a sign of our humility or ecumenism; it is a mask for arrogance and selfishness. It is, and I mean this sincerely and with all humility, not worthy of us. We are a better people than that.

We're not a perfect nation. Our history has had its moments of shame and profound regret. But what we have achieved in our brief history is irrefutable proof that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger, more decent, and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity.

As blessed as we are, no nation complacent in its greatness can long sustain it. We, too, must prove, as those who came before us proved, that a people free to act in their own interests, will perceive those interests in an enlightened way, will live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, and make of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages, a civilization in which all people share in the promise and responsibilities of freedom.

Should we claim our rights and leave to others the duty to the ideals that protect them, whatever we gain for ourselves will be of little lasting value. It will build no monuments to virtue, claim no honored place in the memory of posterity, offer no worthy summons to the world. Success, wealth and celebrity gained and kept for private interest is a small thing. It makes us comfortable, eases the material hardships our children will bear, purchase[s] a fleeting regard for our lives, yet not the self-respect that, in the end, matters most. But sacrifice for a cause greater than yourself, and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause, your self-respect assured.

All lives are a struggle against selfishness. All my life I’ve stood a little apart from institutions that I willingly joined. It just felt natural to me. But if my life had shared no common purpose, it would not have amounted to much more than eccentricity. There is no honor or happiness in just being strong enough to be left alone. I've spent nearly fifty years in the service of this country and its ideals. I have made many mistakes, and I have many regrets. But I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I wasn’t grateful for the privilege. That’s the benefit of service to a country that is an idea and a cause, a righteous idea and cause. America and her ideals helped spare me from the weaknesses in my own character. And I cannot forget it.

When I was a young man, I thought glory was the highest attainment, and all glory was self-glory. My parents had tried to teach me otherwise, as did my church, as did the Naval Academy. But I didn’t understand the lesson until later in life, when I confronted challenges I never expected to face.

In that confrontation, I discovered that I was dependent on others to a greater extent than I had ever realized, but neither they nor the cause we served made any claims on my identity. On the contrary, they gave me a larger sense of myself than I had had before. And I am a better man for it. I discovered that nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a cause that encompasses you but is not defined by your existence alone. And that has made all the difference, my friends, all the differences in the world.

Let -- Let us argue with each other then. By all means, let us argue. Our differences are not petty. They often involve cherished beliefs, and represent our best judgment about what is right for our country and humanity. Let us defend those beliefs. Let’s do so sincerely and strenuously. It is our right and duty to do so. And let’s not be too dismayed with the tenor and passion of our arguments, even when they wound us. We have fought among ourselves before in our history, over big things and small, with worse vitriol and bitterness than we experience today.

Let us exercise our responsibilities as free people. But let us remember, we are not enemies. We are compatriots defending ourselves from a real enemy. We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom, promote the general welfare, and defend our ideals. It should remain an argument among friends; each of us struggling to hear our conscience, and heed its demands; each of us, despite our differences, united in our great cause, and respectful of the goodness in each other. I have not always heeded that injunction myself, and I regret it very much.

I had a friend once, who, a long time ago, in the passions and resentments of a tumultuous era in our history, I might have considered my enemy. He had come once to the capitol of the country that held me prisoner, that deprived me and my dearest friends of our most basic rights, and that murdered some of us. He came to that place to denounce our country’s involvement in the war that had led us there. His speech was broadcast into our cells. I thought it a grievous wrong then, and I still do.

A few years later, he had moved temporarily to a kibbutz in Israel. He was there during the Yom Kippur War, when he witnessed the support America provided our beleaguered ally. He saw the huge cargo planes bearing the insignia of the United States Air Force rushing emergency supplies into that country. And he had an epiphany. He had believed America had made a tragic mistake by going to Vietnam, and he still did. He had seen what he believed were his country’s faults, and he still saw them. But he realized he has -- he had let his criticism temporarily blind him to his country’s generosity and the goodness that most Americans possess, and he regretted his failing deeply. When he returned to his country he became prominent in Democratic Party politics, and helped [elect] Bill Clinton President of the United States. He criticized his government when he thought it wrong, but he never again lost sight of all that unites us.

We met some years later. He approached me and asked to apologize for the mistake he believed he had made as a young man. Many years had passed since then, and I bore little animosity for anyone because of what they had done or not done during the Vietnam War. It was an easy thing to accept such a decent act, and we moved beyond our old grievance.

We worked together in an organization dedicated to promoting human rights in the country where he and I had once come for different reasons. I came to admire him for his generosity, his passion for his ideals, and for the largeness of his heart, and I realized he had not been my enemy, but my countryman, my countryman, and later my friend. His friendship honored me. We disagreed over much. Our politics were often opposed, and we argued those disagreements. But we worked together for our shared ideals. We were not always in the right, but we weren’t always in the wrong either, and we defended our beliefs as we had each been given the wisdom to defend them.

David [Ifshin] remained my countryman and my friend, until the day of his death, at the age of forty-seven, when he left a loving wife and three beautiful children, and legions of friends behind him. His country was a better place for his service to Her, and I had become a better man for my friendship with him. God bless him.

And may God bless you, Class of 2006. The world does indeed await you, and humanity is impatient for your service. Take good care of that responsibility. Everything depends upon it. 

And thank you, very much, for the privilege of sharing this great occasion with you.

President DeGioia, Chairman Villani, Dean McAuliffe, members of the board, distinguished faculty and staff, proud and relieved parents, calm and serene grandparents, distracted but secretly pleased siblings, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, graduating seniors, good afternoon, and thank you for this great honor. I am also deeply honored that you have asked me here to say a few words at this momentous occasion, that you might find what I have to say worthy of your attention on so important a day.

Standing here, I am reminded of the time in the early years of the twentieth century when Mark Twain was given an honorary degree at Oxford University. It was an amazing moment, this son of a slave-holder from the backwoods, the frontier of a relatively young and fragile country, who had raised himself up and almost single-handedly invented American literature by writing the way we sounded and by grappling with our country’s original sin and great shame–slavery–suddenly found himself sharing center stage with the sculptor Auguste Rodin, the composer Camille Saint-Saens, and the writer Rudyard Kipling at one of the world’s great and ancient universities. The significance of the moment was not lost on the chattering press, who rushed up and surrounded the bemused Twain, now wearing a handsome cap and gown, clutching his diploma, and asked him how it felt to have come so far and be thus celebrated. Twain allowed that he was aware of the distance he had traveled in his life and was honored by the distinction accorded him that day, but he was really, as he put it, just “crazy about the clothes.”

I have now had some experience with this speech-making business, but many years ago when I was first asked to address graduating students, I was in a real panic. I spoke to a number of friends who had had some practice with this sort of thing to try ease my anxiety about what to say. Their advice and collective wisdom was very helpful. Then and now. One said to avoid clichés like the plague. Another gave the best advice for me and for you: “Be yourself.” But then, one especially blunt friend said, “By all means, don’t tell them their future lies ahead of them. That’s the worst.”

I thought about this for a long time and I am now absolutely convinced that he was right and that your future lies behind you. In your past, personal and collective. In the last thirty years of filmmaking, I have learned many things, but that the past is our greatest teacher is perhaps the most important lesson.

The question becomes for us now: what will we choose as our pole star? Which distant events will provide us with the greatest help, the most comforting solace, the perfect example of wisdom and leadership?

A story. In January of 1838, shortly before his 29th birthday, a tall thin lawyer prone to bouts of debilitating depression, addressed the Young Men’s Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois. “At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?” he asked his audience. “… Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the Earth and crush us at a blow?” Then he answered his own question: “Never. All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa … could not by force take a drink from the Ohio [River] or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years … If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” It is a stunning, remarkable statement.

That young man was, of course, Abraham Lincoln, and he would go on to preside over the closest this country has ever come to near national suicide, our Civil War, and yet embedded in his extraordinary, disturbing and prescient words is also a fundamental optimism that implicitly acknowledges the geographical force-field two mighty oceans and two relatively benign neighbors north and south have provided for us since the British burned the White House in the War of 1812.

In many respects, September 11th ended all of that, rupturing the sense of invincibility and safety we had gradually acquired as the cold war receded into the past. Still, as we struggle to redefine ourselves in the wake of that rupture, it is interesting that we come back again and again to that war and Abraham Lincoln for the kind of sustaining vision of why we Americans still agree to cohere, why unlike any other country on earth, we are still stitched together by words, and most important their dangerous progeny, ideas. It is altogether fitting and proper that some of those powerful words and ideas of Lincoln’s should have echoed at ground zero on the first anniversary of September 11th and amplified our own feeble, and yet terribly moving, attempts at memorial. We have counted on Abraham Lincoln for nearly a century and a half to get it right when the undertow in the tide of human events has threatened to overwhelm and capsize us. We return to him over and over again for a sense of unity, conscience, and national purpose.

But for the most part we live, today, in a culture so dedicated to an all-consuming present, where people can name you ten brands of blue jeans or perfume or handbags, but can’t name you that many presidents, that we are all, I suppose, complicit in helping to eradicate our past and its valuable lessons. History has become, for most people, a kind of castor oil of dry dates and facts and events – something we know is good for us but hardly good tasting. We’re certain that if we just continue to acquire things, to live in the right place (preferably a safe gated community), to wear the right clothes, to drive the right cars, everything will be alright. But of course, it won’t be alright. The inevitable vicissitudes and sufferings that intrude into even the most carefully planned and orchestrated life, have a way of disrupting things; or to put it another way, someone once told me, if you want to make God laugh, tell him (or her) your plans.

So I shudder, too, when the full force of Lincoln’s youthful warning comes back to my consciousness – that the real threat always and still comes from within this favored land, that the greatest enemy is, as our religious teachings constantly remind us, always ourselves.


The great jurist Learned Hand (and could there be a better name for a judge than Learned Hand?) once said that, “Liberty is never being too sure you’re right.” But somehow we have today replaced our usual and healthy doubt with an arrogance and belligerence that resembles more the ancient and now fallen empires of our history books than a modern compassionate democracy; we’ve begun to start wars instead of finishing them; begun to depend on censorship and intimidation and to infringe on the most basic liberties that have heroically defined and described our trajectory as a nation of free people; begun to reduce the complexity of modern life into facile judgments of good and evil, and now find ourselves brought up short when we see that we have, too, sometimes, in moments, become what we despise.

Nothing could be more dangerous to our future than this arrogance, brought on and amplified as it is by a complete lack of historical awareness among us, and further reinforced by a modern media, cloaked in democratic slogans, but dedicated to the most stultifying kind of consumer existence, convincing us to worship gods of commerce and money and selfish advancement above all else.

“There are grave doubts at the hugeness of the land,” Henry Adams once wrote, “and whether one government can comprehend the whole.” It is a perfect quote as well, accurately conveying the anxiety of Americans in the middle of the 19th Century who feared that this collection of former colonies could ever expand to continental status, could ever deal as one nation with the sectional discord that threatened, as Lincoln predicted, civil war.

Civil war did come, yet the phrase “the United States are,” as we referred to ourselves plurally before the war, paradoxically morphed after the war into a singular “the United States is” that we still, ungrammatically, refer to today. There was hope we could, as Adams put it so well, “comprehend the whole.”

But, alas, today we find ourselves in the midst of a new, subtler, perhaps more dangerous, civil war. The first one proved, above all, that a minority view could not secede politically or geographically from this union.

Now we are poised to fight that war again, and perhaps again and again, this time socially and culturally, where the threat is fundamentalism wherever it raises its intolerant head. The casualties this time will be our sense of common heritage, our sense of humor, our sense of balance and cohesion. The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. said that we suffer today from “too much pluribus and not enough unum.”

Our first Civil War started, as the writer Shelby Foote says, because we failed to do what we Americans do best: compromise. “We like to think of ourselves as uncompromising people,” he said, “but our genius is for compromise and when that broke down, we started killing each other.” The lesson for us, today, is tolerance and the mitigating wisdom that sees beyond the dialectical preoccupation that has set each individual, each group, each region of the country, against the whole.

So, I ask those of you graduating today, male or female, black or white or brown or yellow, young or old, straight or gay, to become soldiers in a new Union Army, an army dedicated to the preservation of this country’s great ideals, a vanguard against this new separatism and disunion, a vanguard against those who, in the name of our great democracy, have managed to diminish it.

This is a human problem. An American problem. Not a red state or a blue state problem. Our problem. Your problem.

So what do we make of all this? Let me speak directly to the graduating class.

As you pursue your goals in life, that is to say your future, pursue your past. Let it be your guide. Insist on having a past and then you will have a future.

Do not descend too deeply into specialism in your work. Educate all your parts. You will be healthier. Replace cynicism with its old-fashioned antidote, skepticism.

Don’t confuse success with excellence. The poet Robert Penn Warren once told me that “careerism is death.”

Insist on heroes. And be one.

Read. The book is still the greatest manmade machine of all – not the car, not the TV, not the computer.

Write: write letters. Keep journals. Besides your children, there is no surer way of achieving immortality.

Serve your country. Insist that we fight the right wars. Convince your government that the real threat comes from within this favored land, as Lincoln knew. Governments always forget that. Do not let your government outsource honesty, transparency, or candor. Do not let your government outsource democracy. Steel yourselves. Your generation will have to repair this damage. And it will not be easy.

Insist that we support science and the arts, especially the arts. They have nothing to do with the actual defense of our country – they just make our country worth defending.

Do not lose your enthusiasm. In its Greek etymology, the word enthusiasm means, “God in us.”

Good luck. And God speed.

Thank you. I want to thank Dr. Nunley and the Board of Trustees for this honorary degree. It's true—believe it or not—as Dr. Nunley said, I am the first mother of school-age children to serve as Secretary of Education. And no offense, but what took them so long!

Education is an issue that touches everyone's life, so wherever I go, people want to talk shop with me. A few weeks ago, one of the women at my hairdressers told me she was about to become the first person in her family to ever graduate from college.

Her name is Silvia Portillo, and she wants to become a teacher. And when she told me she'd be walking across stage here at Montgomery College today, I said, "I'll see you there." I would have worn a cap today, but I didn't want Silvia to think I didn't like my hair.

Like so many of you, Silvia has worked her way through college. That's the American dream. And today, all of you are living it. Congratulations!

I'm honored to be here at Montgomery College to mark this tremendous occasion with the college faculty, family, friends, and of course, the Class of 2006. Let me give a special thanks to your president, Dr. Nunley, for inviting me.

As you all know, Dr. Nunley has announced she's retiring after 27 years here. I've seen her commitment to education and community colleges firsthand. She serves on the Commission on the Future of Higher Education I appointed last fall. Together, we're working to find ways to help more Americans realize the dream of college in the 21st century.

One thing we already know is that community colleges are essential to making that dream come true for millions of Americans every year. Nearly half of all American undergraduates today are at community colleges, and I'm proud that the majority of students receiving federal Pell Grant aid are community college students. It's one of the best investments we can make in America's future. And last week at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, President Bush became the first sitting president to ever deliver a commencement at a community college.

On a personal level, I'll always have a special place in my heart for community colleges. I used to work at one—Austin Community College in Texas. I was in charge of helping customize job training around community workforce needs. And I saw firsthand how community colleges respond to the needs of a rapidly changing high-tech economy.

Community colleges can bob and weave to prepare students for new opportunities and better jobs. And they can help ensure employers have the skilled workers they need to serve the community and foster economic growth.

For example, here at Montgomery College, you've partnered with local hospitals in response to a critical shortage of nurses. Thanks to this program, more than a hundred of you graduating today have the hands-on-experience to start work at a hospital tomorrow. And I'm thrilled to hear you're launching a new program with local schools to help meet the growing demand for high-quality teachers in fields like math and science.

We live in a world that is changing faster than ever. And to keep up, we all must adapt and grow. Just think when most of you were in high school, "Googling," "TiVoing," and "blogging" weren't even everyday words. I won't even get into "online dating."

But now more than ever, we can't afford to fall behind the times. That means we all must be lifelong learners. And those of you graduating here today know that better than anyone.

Next year, many of you will head back to school to continue your education. Some of you will return to your careers. And others of you will start entirely new ones. But today my advice to you is the same: Keep learning because you just never know what life has in store for you next.

It doesn't seem like that long ago, I was working my way through college at the University of Houston—checking groceries at Handy Andy. I commuted to school just like you. So I know all those times you said you were late for class because you couldn't find parking or you were stuck in traffic, you were actually telling the truth.

I remember graduating from college and you know some people have their 20 year plan, their 10 year plan—I'm not sure if I had a 24-hour plan.

I went through several careers—headhunting consultant, substitute teacher, campaign staffer on a losing presidential campaign—and that was just my first year out!

What got me through those first months—and many times since—has been some good advice, most notably from my mother, Peg.

It's been the rare situation when I didn't hear my mother's voice uttering one of her famous—or infamous—"Pegisms." A few of my favorites:

"You need loving most when you're most unlovable!"

"How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice."

I wish she'd told me not to get married right after college... but that's another story.

Many of you can probably think of words of wisdom your mom says all the time. And as many of you already know—especially those of you with kids of your own—sometimes you'll say something, and you'll stop in horror and realize: "I sound just like my mother!"

Being a mom has been my most important job and the greatest joy of my life. My daughter Mary just finished her first year of college. And it's a relief to see her thrive because as I told her and her sister Grace—You can't be the child left behind!

My girls have gotten me through tough times, taught me more than I'd like to admit, and kept me grounded and focused on what counts. To them, I'm not the Secretary of Education. I'm their goofy mom who makes them clean up their rooms before we watch American Idol!

Through the years, I've definitely found myself uttering a few "Pegisms." And along the way, I've come up with my own Margaretisms. So, I'd like to share some of that advice with you.

First, life has no limits. It's unpredictable, thrilling, awesome. And to live fully, you've got to seize opportunity, roll with the punches, be a little daring, and above all, keep your head in the game!

That's what I tell my girls. To succeed, you've got to have focus—the ability to see the big picture, the courage to dig in and persevere—so that when life throws you a curve, you don't get derailed.

Because life keeps you guessing.

Sometimes the road stretches straight ahead. Sometimes you're stuck in 5 o'clock traffic. Sometimes you're just trying to find the nearest exit.

And one thing you'll discover is that—more often than not—what at first appear to be roadblocks and setbacks are the very things that'll get you where you were meant to be.

I certainly never thought I'd be in the President's Cabinet. When I was working my way through college, when I spent years uncertain of my career path, I could never have predicted or planned where I find myself today.

But, while I may not have always known where I was heading, I had focus and faith. If you believe in yourself, others will too. And if you have confidence in who you are, there is no end to what you can accomplish.

As I tell my girls: Stand and Deliver.

When I first got to the White House, I felt completely out of my element, surrounded by Ivy Leaguers. But, I stood and delivered. I did my best. And before long, I was meeting with Senators, flying on Air Force One, and helping the President perfect his pronunciations. We're still working on "nucular."

It just goes to show the only boundaries to what you can achieve are the ones you set for yourself.

Always aim high. Don't settle for what you know you can accomplish. Challenge yourself to pursue the impossible, and you'll go further than you could ever imagine.

I've always liked the story of the college student who got a C on his final paper because his idea was implausible. The idea ... an overnight delivery service. The student ... Fred Smith. You may know him better as the CEO of FedEx.

So, don't let anyone else take the measure of your worth and capabilities. Always stand proud in who you are!

You've juggled exams, families, jobs, and challenges to be here today. This diploma represents a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Kanika Hughley has made it through honors classes on top of working a 40-hour a week job and caring for her sick dad. When she graduated from high school in 1994, she was an honor roll student and a senior class officer, but her family was having financial problems. And Kanika took a full-time job to help. In 2001, Montgomery College gave her the opportunity to get the college education she always wanted.

And today, she's graduating with honors as the student member of Montgomery College's Board of Trustees. It's an honor to be up here on stage with you. Congratulations Kanika and congratulations to all of you! There are countless other stories like hers. And I would go on and on except I know my speech is the last thing standing between you, your degrees, and your well-deserved celebrations.

And I know some of you have been waiting almost a lifetime for this moment to come. Ten of you graduating are older than this college, and I'm not naming names because no one would ever be able to tell!

Others of you have literally flown half way across the world to be here, from Cameroon and China to Poland and Peru. And wherever you go next, you know you'll be ready thanks to the foundation you built here at Montgomery College.

You're graduating at a time when the job market is strong, and college graduates like you are in demand. Set your sights high; dream big; and never settle for anything less.

As I tell my girls, "If all you ever do is all you've ever done, then all you'll ever get is all you've ever got."

It's easy to get caught up in life's routine. Take time to pause and make sure that you're living life and life isn't living you. Have a plan, but don't be afraid to improvise. Get off the beaten path. Explore the detours and back roads. Don't be in such a hurry to get where you're going that you miss some amazing scenery along the way.

That's just a little sampling of advice. You may be thinking about the advice your own parents and grandparents have given you or the advice you give your own kids ... when they choose to listen that is!

Hang with me, because I want to leave you with one final thought.

We live in a world where technology has connected us in ways that we could never have imagined even a decade ago.

But the things that really matter still matter most. And I want to give a special thanks to those of you here today who have answered the call to serve in our nation's armed forces or have loved ones overseas fighting to defend our freedom. We're all grateful for your sacrifice.

No matter what you do in life, I want to encourage all of you to find some way to give back. The impact of that choice will not only improve the lives of others, it will enlarge and enrich yours as well.

As I said at the start, we're all lifelong learners. So go forward. Believe in yourself. Never give up. And may today be the beginning of a new journey, a great adventure, a life lived well and with purpose.

Thank you. And congratulations!

Thank you! Welcome Students, professors, family and friends. I am incredibly honored to be here today to share this amazing stepping stone in your lives. I am especially grateful to receive this honorary law degree. While you toiled in academia and struggled in side jobs to be here today, I just took the Mass Turnpike to Andover. Few things in life are this easy and so I thank you. My parents thank you too. They are very proud to finally have a lawyer in the family.

And so I begin my law career by making your commencement address today. This is not an easy task. I researched literally dozens of commencement addresses. Some were touching, some were funny, but most were boring, filled with platitudes and advice I do not feel qualified to give, and so I will speak from the place I know best. My own life experience.

For those of you who don’t know who I am, my name is Marian Fontana. And as a I sat at my own commencement address—just a few—years ago, I had many dreams, aspirations and goals. I imagined my life, as many do with a successful career, relationship and marriage, home, children.

Before 9-11, I was working hard to make these goals happen. I married my college sweetheart, a handsome sculpture major, who was a lifeguard in the summer. We moved into Manhattan where I wrote one woman shows, plays and screenplays. I performed off Broadway, did commercials, bit parts in movies. I worked a dozen odd jobs on the side to make ends meet. I taught gymnastics, performed in schools, taught Special Ed classes, nursery school and latch key kids. I waitressed at a dozen restaurants, answered phones at a law firm, “Goldstein, Farrell, Shindler and Garbus.” I even drove a cab, but being a starving artist was difficult and when I didn’t get the part, or my screenplay was rejected, Dave urged me on, telling me to stay in the moment. “Why take the trip if you’re not going to enjoy the ride?” he would often say.

Dave got called to join the fire academy in the Fall of 1991. What began as a job to have time to sculpt, soon became Dave’s passion. He loved firefighting and felt blessed he had found his calling. We moved to Park Slope Brooklyn where Dave worked in a historic firehouse in a Brownstone neighborhood and our son Aidan was born a few years later. We named him Aidan meaning little fire in Irish and were overwhelmed by the fierce love we felt for him. But I continued to write and perform, struggling to balance the tray of motherhood, day jobs, auditions, writing, theater, friends and family. What I didn’t realize then, that I had achieved success long ago.

And then came September 11th, my eighth wedding anniversary, the day my husband and best friend never came home, the day we all changed forever. The world called Dave a hero for running into the towers and saving thousands of lives. I will forever be proud of what Dave did, but to me Dave was a hero for being my partner for 17 years, for the small acts of kindness he showed people every day: the way he smiled at people when they passed, or pulled the neighborhood kids in Aidan’s wagon, how he always held the door open for the next person, over tipped the waitress, or sang softly to my son at bedtime. When someone close to you dies, it is not the big moments you remember, but small moments, the seemingly insignificant way Dave wheezed slightly when he laughed hard, or how he loved the way the earth smelled in the fall. If you can notice these moments, breathe them in, even for a second, on your way to the courtroom, or the office, or wherever your life will lead you, well then you have achieved success.

After my husband died, my neighborhood in Brooklyn rallied around me shoring me up like a falling tree. The women made lasagnas and brought me tissues, the men took my son out to play baseball. I did not have the heart to tell these well meaning Dads that my husband Dave was probably the only firefighter in the country with absolutely no interest in sports. I didn’t have the heart to explain this when they signed him up for Little League in Prospect Park even though Aidan showed no interest, collapsing onto the field picking at the grass or his nose, depending on his mood. The Dads were patient.

“Good job buddy” they would say or “keep your eye on the ball” but it was futile.

I wanted to stand idly by, to be one of those placid moms that read the New Yorker, encouraging their child with a silent smile, but I turned into something else. All my fears for Aidan, my need for him to feel like other boys, turned me into the sports equivalent of a stage mom. I yelled, cheered, stomped in ways I am embarrassed about now. “AIDAN PAY ATTENTION!” I would scream in the rare moments the ball would actually make its way to Aidan’s side of the field, practically running onto the grass to catch it myself. I clapped hard when our players hit a ball and secretly gloated when we won. I became the kind of mother they make after school specials about. I constantly told Aidan he was a great hitter, despite the fact that he ran the wrong way and yelled “Touch down” when he returned to home plate.

Two years later, when we crossed the Verrazano bridge for a new life in Staten Island, I vowed never to do baseball again, signing Aidan up for Karate instead. It was the perfect Sport for him. There was no team, they meditate, encourage community, and beat the crap out of each other. I take Aidan to class, go next door to Starbucks and write. There are no games on weekends, no cold mornings in the bleachers. I don’t yell. Life is simple and we are slowly healing.

But recently word spread that Aidan was fatherless and teamless and so once again, Dads began knocking on my door. And so I have spent this last month, perched on benches once again, screaming at the top of my lungs for two games a week and a practice on Friday. Aidan’s lack of talent is more pronounced now since most of the boys have been playing since he stopped. It doesn’t help that Aidan is the tallest boy, his uniform tight, his long wavy brown hair poking from the side of his too small hat.

At the game last week, on a warm, light green Spring day, Aidan yelled. “Look Mom! A Cardinal!” pointing to a brilliant red speck on top of the chain link fence surrounding the field.

“Fontana! Glove in FRONT!” the coach yelled and I heard a crack and noticed a ball sailing toward Aidan, but he was still looking at the bird who was now perched on top of the scoreboard. I forced myself not to scream. I heard the first base coach whisper to the head coach that Aidan sucked and my heart ached to protect him from all of it: from missed balls and mean people, from being fired or broken up with, from the smell of a hospital and unbearable loneliness. I just wanted him to keep staring at the bird, because we both know that it could fly away at any moment.

A few weeks ago, I was reading the New York Times about another young life lost on September 11th. Ann Nelson was an employee from Cantor Fitzgerald and would have been thirty five on May 17th this year. Amazingly, her laptop was recovered and sent to her parents recently. When they finally found the strength to turn it on, one of the documents was a list of a 100 things to do, a catalog of goals. It began

1. Be healthy/ healthful. 
2. Make a quilt.
3. Nepal.
4. Learn a foreign language. 
5. Never be ashamed of who I am.
6. Read every day.
7. Volunteer for a charity. 
8. Grand Canyon.
9. Appreciate money, but don't worship it. 
9. Learn about wine.

Annes list went until 35. I am sure you have lists of your own and wish for you to live in the moment, see the cardinal, do something on your list, however big or small.

The media calls it a post 9-11 world now, and I am sorry that you, the class of 2006 are a part of this frightening time of war, terrorism and a fragile earth, but in my post 9-11 world, I saw something else. I watched the facades of people fall away and sighed as they hugged in the streets, lit candles, wrote songs and placed flowers at firehouse doors. After 9-11, scared and humbled, people called to action the very best of themselves. Children from all over the country sent me teddy bears, drawings, taping their allowances to pieces of paper. People banded together in a thousand small acts of kindness and out of the ashes, a new spirit was born. I watched us hold tighter to our families, reevaluate what matters and this buoyed me through the dark hours of my grief.

The moment faded too fast as we entered into an unjust war and endless challenges for our future, but I saw the best of humanity, the essence of who we can be and know that it exists in all of you. Our wounds are our best lessons, our life’s biggest teachers and I have seen powerful love that has changed me forever. It has made me try to walk in other shoes, show more compassion and humility. I believe more than ever in social justice and losing my husband has made me fearless and care less about what others think. I recognize that I am a work in progress, that I will make many mistakes and I will try to learn from them and even when I sit with politicians and speak on tv, I know that it is the small, tender moments in my life that make me who I am.

I think that is why I am especially honored to speak at the Massachusetts School of Law, because I was impressed by its unique acceptance policies. The school looks at the whole person not only accepting students on their grades, or their ability to pay, but on their commitment, their striving for better. I hope you will use those principles to guide you on your path.

In closing, I would like to offer up a final quote. I found it taped to my desk in those early days of my career when I was struggling, despairing over yet another rejection letter. Dave had taped it there to inspire me and it does to this day. It is a quote from Teddy Roosevelt and I will paraphrase

"It is not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, in the end, knows the triumph of high achievement, and who, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."

You are all in the arena already. My heartiest congratulations to all of you, the class of 2006.

Thank you.

It’s a great honor to stand here with my fellow honorees, distinguished aboriginal leaders, distinguished business and community leaders.  I want to thank the university for the honor you’ve done me.  I also want to say, “Niagara is a small school, but you put on one mighty convocation.”

All I can say is I wish you could see what I see.  It’s a wonderful sight.  I’m so pleased to be here and share this moment with you.  I was particularly touched, as a citizen of Canada, that you sang my national anthem.  One of the things that makes us lucky to be Canadians is that we have you as our neighbors, our friends and our allies.  

We’re so much like you that you can hardly tell us apart, and then we do something like (speaks several sentences in French). What I said in French was, “The links of friendship, the links of loyalty, the links of kinship the links of business connection that we have are some of the best things in our life across this border.  Long live or differences, long live our friendship together as two great peoples.”  

I also want to salute what this day represents, which is the great tradition of Catholic learning in the United States, the great tradition of Vincent de Paul, the tradition of service to the less fortunate, the tradition of service to your faith, the tradition of service to your country.  One of the greatest things about the United States is the strength of your higher education system, and Catholic education is at the center of that greatness.

Now, I know that I stand between you and what really matters here, so I’m going to be brief.  I’m the guy who stands between you and watching your loved ones get their degrees, so I’m going to cut to the chase here and talk a little bit about education.  And I’m going to address the distinguished purple rows in front of me.  

If you’re the first person in your family to get a college degree, why don’t you pledge today that you won’t be the last.  Turn this into a family tradition.  That’s the first thing.  The second thing I want you to do is don’t forget this university, give back to this university, support this university, sustain this university.  Help other students in the future, your children, your grandchildren, to come here and enjoy the education that you received.  Keep the faith with Niagara. That’s my second piece of advice today.  I think the third thing I want to say is to keep faith with yourself. What an education has given you, I hope, is some confidence in your own reasoning powers, confidence in your judgment, confidence in your own moral compass.  Education entitles you to a little respect. It doesn’t make you better than anybody else, but it entitles you to respect.  So if you’re entitled to respect because of your education, treat everyone who crosses your path with respect.  

Let me say something else that’s a little more difficult to say.  This is your life.  This is your life.  You can’t live this life for your mom, or your dad, your sister, or your brother.  You only get one of these things called a life, and you have to live it for yourself.  The paradox here is I think when you live truly a life that you own, that you possess, that is truly yours, that’s the best way, and the truest way, to serve others, to keep faith with others, to be a loyal friend, a good husband, a good wife, a good companion.  This is your life so make sure you own it.  Make sure you fully possess it. I’ve tried to do that in my own life, and I’ve discovered that one of the most difficult things is to be true to yourself, to be determined that this is going to be the life you live according to your direction and not according to anyone else’s.

It takes courage, and I want to finish by talking just for a second about courage.  It takes courage to live your own life.  It takes courage to take risks.  I’ve been a war reporter, and I’ve gotten shot at.  I’ve been a journalist.  I’ve been a writer.  And I’ve done the craziest thing of all, I’ve become a politician.  And we’ll see how that turns out.    

But I’ve tried to live my life by taking measured, calculated, and, I hope, rational risks, and I hope you will do so too.  The thing I’ve learned out of my life is the people that I respect most are the fearless ones.  The people I admire most are the people who show courage in their lives.  And courage takes a lot of different forms.  

When I was running for election in my own riding, I came across a woman who incarnated courage to me.  She was a woman in her late 60s, and I asked how she was doing.  And she said she was doing great.  She was having a terrific day.  And I said to her, “What have you been doing?”  She said, “I’ve been bathing my husband. He has Alzheimer’s disease, you know.”  I know a little bit about this because my mother died of Alzheimer’s disease, and I know the daily, constant courage it takes to stand by a woman or a man you’ve married and you love and want to treat right.  That’s the kind of courage our society should always celebrate and applaud, the kind of courage I pretty well worship, and I met it in that woman.  There’s the courage, in other words, of love, the courage of steadfastness.  And it’s hard to love people when they’re old, and sick, and wounded.  And that’s when you have to show courage.  

There’s the courage of service--service to your country, service to your community.  But almost the hardest form of courage is the courage to stay true to yourself, to make sure that you do not allow your life to be driven by fear.  Do not ever forget what that great president, Franklin Roosevelt, said. It really is my watchword.  “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”  Fear deforms lives, fear crushes lives.  Don’t let fear run your life.  Let courage run your life.  And if you’ll allow me one final word, number yourself at the end of your days as one of the fearless ones.  Be the fearless person in your community.  Number yourself among the fearless.  

Thank you very much.


Good Morning IU! And a special hello to the person sitting in the last seat, upstairs, way in the back. That was the best seat I ever could get for a basketball game as an undergrad here.

More than a few years ago, I was sitting right where you are… literally in one of those exact same seats out there… listening to a graduation speaker proclaim how important it is to succeed in your job. It would have been an inspiring speech except for the fact that neither I nor half my friends had a job lined up by commencement day. Sound familiar to anyone out there?

At my graduation, all I had was a very big dream and a very big question: “Bloomington to Hollywood--- How do you get there from here?” I couldn’t just declare I wanted to produce the definitive, dark, serious “Batman” movie and make that leap in a single bound. The problem was: A. I had no family in the motion picture industry; B. I had no friends in the motion picture industry; and C. I didn’t come from money so I couldn’t buy my way in.

I had to start on my career path with a series of smaller, achievable goals that could lead me into the world of “Batman.” I needed something I could do at IU that would get me on the radar in Hollywood and in New York.

Indiana University empowered me to get a job which could eventually lead me to my dream, and it did so by catering to the needs of one individual student. Here’s how it happened…and believe me, it’s hard to believe:

When I was an undergrad, IU had an experimental curriculum department in the College of Arts & Sciences. If you had an idea for a course that was non-traditional and had never been taught before, and if you had the backing of a department, you could appear before a panel of deans and professors to pitch your idea. If they approved it, your course would be accredited and you could teach it on campus.

So, I created a course on comic books, claiming comics to be not only a legitimate American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz, but also as contemporary folklore… modern day mythology. The gods of Egypt, Greece and Rome still exist, only today they wear capes and spandex.

With the backing of the Folklore Department, I appeared before a panel of professors and deans. I entered a dark, mahogany room with a very long conference table right out of the Justice League’s secret sanctum. Now, keep in mind this was the early 1970’s. My hair was down to my shoulders, I was wearing a Spider-Man T-shirt and I think I still had my love beads on.

The professor at the far end of the table looked down at me over those little half-glasses perched on the edge of his nose, and said, “So you’re the fellow who wants to teach a course on ‘funny books’ at my university?” I knew I was in deep… trouble.

He let me speak for two minutes and then he cut me off. “Mr. Uslan,” he said, “I don’t buy your theory. Comic books are cheap entertainment for children. Nothing more. Nothing less. Look, I read them all when I was a kid. I read every issue of ‘Superman’ comics I could get my hands on. But contemporary folklore? Modern day mythology? I reject your theory.”

It was my moment of truth. I inquired if I could ask two questions, and he said I could ask him anything I wanted. So I asked if he was familiar with the story of Moses. He told me he was. I then requested that he very briefly summarize the story of Moses. Eyeing me as if I was insane, he replied that he wasn’t sure what game I was playing, but he would play it with me.

The professor said, “The Hebrews were being persecuted, their first-born were being slain. A Hebrew couple placed their infant son in a little wicker basket and sent him down the River Nile where he was discovered by an Egyptian family who raised him as their own son. When he grew up and learned of his heritage, he became a great hero to his people by---“I said, thank you. That was great. You mentioned before that you read ‘Superman’ comics as a kid. Do you remember the origin of Superman?” He did. “What’s the origin of Superman?” I asked.

The professor said, “The planet Krypton was about to explode. A scientist and his wife placed their infant son in a little rocket ship and sent him to earth. There, he was discovered by the Kents who raised him as their own son. When he grew up---“Suddenly, the professor stopped talking and just stared at me for what seemed like an eternity. He then said, “Your course is accredited.”

“Oh my God, I would be teaching the world’s first accredited comic books course!” I’m walking on air back to my apartment at 10th and Grant when all of a sudden I recall what an IU business prof said to me. He said, “Being creative is not enough. You must market yourself and your ideas if you wish to succeed.”

So I picked up a telephone and called United Press International, the huge wire service in Indianapolis. I asked to speak to the reporter who covered education in Indiana. A man got on the phone and I started to scream at him: “What’s wrong with you?!? The press is supposed to be the watchdog for the people. I can’t believe you’re letting them get away with this!”

The reporter pleaded with me to slow down, and explain to him what I was talking about. I said, “I hear there’s a course on comic books being taught at Indiana University. This is outrageous! Are you telling me as a taxpayer that my money is going to teach our kids ‘funny books’?! This must be some Communist plot to infiltrate the youth of America!” And I hung up the phone.

It took this reporter three days to find out if IU really had this course and, if so, who the lunatic was who was teaching it. He came to Bloomington to interview me and then went out with a huge story with photos. It was picked up by almost every newspaper in North America and Europe. From that day on, my phone rang off the hook. Requests for me to appear on radio and TV talk shows. NBC, CBS and other news crews came to IU and I never once taught a class that wasn’t packed with TV cameras and reporters from everything from “Family Weekly” to Playboy.” I even had my picture appear in “Ripley’s Believe It Or Not.” My mother was so proud!

Three weeks later, my phone rings. “Is this Michael Uslan? This is Stan Lee from Marvel Comics in New York.” Now for you uninitiated, Stan Lee is the co-creator of “Spider-Man,” “X-Men,” “Fantastic Four,” “The Hulk,” and the entire pantheon of Marvel super-heroes. Hearing Stan’s voice over my phone was what I call my very own “Burning Bush” moment. He said, “Mike, everywhere I turn, I see you on TV or in magazines or newspapers. This course you’re teaching is great for the entire comic book industry. How can I be helpful?” Not two hours later, the head of DC Comics, publishers of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman calls me. He had special plans to target comic books to college students and asked if he could fly me to New York to meet.

“Uh…okay.”

I’m now in New York City at DC Comics and they offer me a summer job. So, one July day as I’m walking by the office of the editor of a character called “The Shadow,” I hear him complaining loudly that he has no idea for a “Shadow” script that’s due the very next day. Quickly, I poked my head into his office and blurted out, “I have an idea for a story.” I didn’t. But I realized this was a “moment” …a chance to get my foot in the door. Carpe Diem. Seize the Day. I hemmed and hawed and literally created a story on the spot. The editor told me to have the script on his desk in 24 hours and suddenly, I’m a comic book writer for DC Comics.

Two weeks later, the editor of “Batman” comics passes me by in the hallway. He was very gruff, but once you got to know him, he was a real marshmallow inside. “Hey, kid,” he said to me. “I read your ‘Shadow’ script.” “You did?” I asked. “Yeah. It didn’t stink.” “Oh, thank you!” I was beaming. And then he said to me, “How’d you like to take a shot writing ‘Batman’?”

Since I was eight years old, I dreamed of writing “Batman.” He was my favorite super-hero because he had no super-powers. His greatest super-power was his humanity. Plus, he had the best Rogues’ Gallery of villains ever! In my heart of hearts, at age eight, I believed that if I studied hard, worked out, and if my Dad bought me a cool car, I could be this guy!

Now that my dream of writing “Batman” comics came true, I needed a new dream. While staring out the window of my Bloomington apartment, I decided I wanted to get to Hollywood and produce the dark, serious “Batman” movie the way he was originally created in 1939 as a creature of the night stalking criminals from the shadows.

The President of DC Comics listened to my goal and tried to give me fatherly advice. “Michael,” he said, “since the ‘Batman’ TV show went off the air, no one’s been interested in Batman for movies. He’s as dead as a Dodo. Go get credentials in the film business and then come back and talk to me.”

So, every Friday of my senior year, I went to the IU Library and read “Variety” magazine, it’s the bible of show business. I jotted down the name of every movie and TV executive mentioned in the articles. By the end of the school year, I had the names of 372 people I could send resumes to, instead of having to send out “To Whom It May Concern” letters to personnel departments. And I typed every one of those 372 cover letters with two fingers on a typewriter. Now for those of you who don’t know what a typewriter is, visit your local museum. You’ll look for it right next to the VCR.

From 372 resumes, I received two job offers: a major New York talent agency invited me to join its agent training program, which would sentence me to two years in their mailroom at $95 per week; and a big-time producer in LA made me an offer to become a production assistant in charge of Xeroxing and going for coffee at a salary of $95 per week. Well, it was time for Plan “B.” And if there’s no other advice I can give you today, it’s always have a Plan “B”…and if you can, a Plan “C.”

Okay, plan “B”: Unable to get my foot in the door creatively in Hollywood at a pay scale above “starvation,” I considered a different route via law school. If I could become an entertainment lawyer as my entrée into the motion picture industry, learn how to finance and produce motion pictures, and meet the power brokers in Hollywood, I could one day sneak in the back door of the creative side.

IU School of Law empowered me by allowing me to take an independent study course because I was the only student in the school interested in entertainment at that time. It was that independent study course that impressed United Artists studio honchos enough to give me, over 200 other applicants, the motion picture production attorney job they had open. Thank you, IU, for yet again accommodating the needs of one individual student.

As part of Plan “B,” I stayed at United Artists as if it was graduate school, learning all I could. Then, determined that I would not be trapped into being a lawyer for the rest of my life, I found a partner and mentor in Ben Melniker, the former Executive Vice President of MGM in its heyday. Together, we raised money, went back to DC with my new credentials, and bought the rights to “Batman.” Believing I had a 51% chance of success with “Batman” in my pocket, I rolled the dice and quit my job, becoming an independent movie producer by sneaking in the proverbial back door.

I thought everyone in Hollywood would line up to finance my dark, serious vision of “Batman.” Instead, I was turned down by every single studio in Hollywood. The rejections piled up quickly: “Michael, you’re crazy! No one’s ever made a movie based on an old TV series. It’s never been done!” “Michael, you’re insane! Nobody will watch a serious version of “Batman. They only remember the pot-bellied funny guy with the Pows! Zaps! And Whams!” “Michael, you’re nuts! (Do you see a pattern here by the way?) Your movie, “Batman,” will fail because our movie, “Annie,” didn’t do well.” I asked this exec if he meant the little red-haired girl who sings, “Tomorrow.” He shook his head affirmatively. “But what does she have to do with ‘Batman’?” He looked at me and said, “Come on, Michael, they’re both out of the ‘funny pages’.” That was my rejection. Finally, even good, old United Artists turned me down cold when its executive said to me, “Michael, you’re out of your mind! Batman and Robin will never work as a movie because the movie, “Robin and Marian” didn’t do well.” Now, that film starred Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn as an aging Robin Hood and Maid Marian. The man apparently turned down “Batman” simply because both movies had the word “Robin” in the title.

From the time we bought the rights to “Batman,” it took ten years for the film to come out. Ten years! Then, it broke one box-office record after another, finally prompting my Mother to stop asking me, “So when are you going to get a real job?” and it spawned an on-going worldwide franchise of movies, animation, videogames, toys, and best of all, last year’s great film made by the genius director, Chris Nolan, “Batman Begins.”

There are four simple but critically important lessons I’ve learned on this journey from Bloomington to Batman, which I’d like to pass along to you at this moment of your graduation:

First, sometimes you have to take calculated risks and roll the dice, or risk growing old and having to say, “I could have been….”

Secondly, you must believe in yourself and in your work. When our first “Batman” movie broke all those box-office records, I received a phone call from that United Artists exec from years before who told me I was out of my mind, that “Robin and Marian” guy. Now he said, “Michael, I’m just calling to congratulate you on “Batman.” I always said you were a visionary.” You see the point --- don’t believe them when they tell you how bad you are and how terrible your ideas are, but also, don’t believe them when they start telling you how wonderful you are and how great your ideas are. Just believe in yourself and believe in your work and you’ll do just fine. And, don’t then forget to market yourself. Use both sides of your brain.

Third, you must have a high threshold for frustration. Take it from the guy who was turned down by every studio in Hollywood. You must knock on doors until your knuckles bleed. Doors will slam in your face, I guarantee it. You must pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go back and knock again. It’s the only way to achieve your goals in life.

Finally, follow whatever your passion is. Do something you love. My dad was a mason, starting at age 16 when he dropped out of school to help his family survive the Depression. Until he was 80 he worked six days a week no matter how hot or how cold out it was outside. He was an old world artist… a real craftsman who created magnificent fireplaces and homes out of bricks and stones. Every morning of my childhood, I saw my Dad jump out of bed before dawn, eager to get to work, a smile on his face. He was doing what he loved and I knew that was what I wanted out of life… to be able to wake up on a rainy Monday morning and be able to say, “Boy, I can’t wait to get to work!” But I had to find my own bricks and stones. Today, I challenge you to find yours.

If there’s one quotation that sums up my journey through life and the choices I’ve made, it’s the closing lines of a poem by Robert Frost, which I now pass along to you:

“I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.”

Bats of luck, every one of you, and congratulations my fellow IU graduates! 

Mr. President, Norman Fainstein, Chairman of the Board, Barbara Kohn, Cynthia Fuller Davis who funded the Fuller-Maathai Professorship, Mab Segrest, who is the Fuller-Maathai Chair of Gender and Women's Studies, faculty, students, parents and friends.

It is a great privilege and honor for me to be here with you to celebrate such a wonderful day. I arrived from Nairobi yesterday and brought this wonderful sun.

Truly, I wanted to be here today at Connecticut College to witness a wonderful passing, sending you out to this beautiful world. To be here especially to celebrate with you because it was you, through Cynthia Fuller Davis's vision, that decided to recognize me long before the Norwegian Nobel Committee knew I existed. So, I thank you very, very much for that recognition. Environmentalism and Peace

The Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to send a new message to the world; wanted to persuade us as a human family to recognize that on this planet Earth the resources are limited. But it was only the Norwegian Nobel Committee that could say with such conviction and voice and strength that the whole world will pay attention to the fact that there is a linkage between the way we use our resources on this planet and peace.

That indeed, for us to enjoy peace, we need to manage our resources more responsibly, more
sustainably, more accountably, more transparently and we need to share these resources more equitably. Yes, we do. And that the only way we can do so is if we learn to govern ourselves through systems and institutions that promote justice, that promote equity, that promote respect for the rule of law, that promote respect for human rights.

Sometimes we call such systems democracy. But that can mean different things to different people. Essentially, it is a system that allows for greater participation of those who are few as well as those who are many; those who are rich as well as those who are poor; those who are strong as well as those who are weak. It is a system that is inclusive, a system that allows the minority to have their voice, their space, their say, even if the majority are going to have their way. 

That system of governance, ladies and gentlemen, students, is what the Norwegian Nobel Committee is urging us to work for. It is nothing new, we all know it. But sometimes we need to be reminded very dramatically so that we can truly work on it, invest in it, in order to preempt conflicts that will definitely come if we don't manage our resources responsibly. If we don't share them equitably, we will not be able to preempt conflict.

And when we think about it, even as we sit here in this beautiful space, we can hardly think of any conflict that is not a conflict over resources. A conflict over how those resources are shared, who accesses those resources, who has to be excluded from those resources. And therefore, if we really want a more peaceful world for ourselves, for our children, for our future generations, we need to rethink the concept of peace and security and the linkage that there is between these three things: sustainable management of resources, good governance and peace.

Now, in our work of the Green Belt Movement, we may not deliberately and consciously work on those three things, but we have come to appreciate that even within our local situation, we were having conflict between communities. When you look at those conflicts, below the politics of ethnicity, below the politics of greed, below the politics of corruption, it was a fact that there was not equitable distribution of resources and there was not transparent, sustainable, accountable
management of the resources even in a very local situation in Kenya. You can expand that. You look at Darfur, where as we speak here millions of children are dying, thousands of people are refugees, over water and grazing ground.

Therefore, we need to rethink so that we can preempt. What the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to emphasize is the fact that we do not need to wait until we have killed each other, until we have destroyed each other, we have destroyed our countries before we give [the] Nobel Prize for Peace to people who go and try to make these adversaries speak to each other, listen to each other.

We need to work and to develop cultures of peace, and cultures of peace require that we learn to listen to each other, that we learn to dialogue with each other, that we learn to respect each other, to respect the rule of law, to respect human rights and to accept that indeed, on this little planet Earth, we need to give each other space.

If we do that, we shall preempt conflicts. There are very many challenges. It is not easy. One time I wrote a paper and I tried to describe the problem of trying to uplift the poor, the disadvantaged, the deprived. I wrote a paper which I called "The Bottom is Heavy," because the people at the bottom sometimes can make themselves extremely heavy. You try to lift them out and constantly they go back to the same depth.

So we need to commit ourselves to raise them, to not give up. If you give up, believe me, sooner or later those you think you have set aside will come back to you; they will come haunting you even in your living room, on your television. When you see those dying people, when you see the wars, when you see the conflicts even though you may be very far from those conflicts, they come. Right there, in your living room.

So, we cannot say that we are very comfortable, we are in a comfortable zone, we should not be concerned. It is not possible to run away from the problems. Sooner or later they become our problems.

As graduating students you are being told a lot. All I can share with you to add to what has already been said is that it is a wonderful thing to go out into the world and play your part. Forty years ago I graduated from a small college in Atchison, Kansas, called Mount St. Scholastica College. Today it is known as Benedictine College. It was a beautiful day like this and I had no idea what was ahead of me. But I carried with me a beautiful Kansas accent that you are listening to and it has helped me a lot. I have never forgotten the wonderful four years I spent in Atchison or the wonderful two years I spent at the University of Pittsburgh. As I have gone around the world, I have remembered what my teachers taught me. I have remembered the professors who influenced me. It was really wonderful to hear you reminiscing on the interactions you had with your professors. Believe me, as you go out into the world you will value them even more because what you have gotten from them — sometimes not what came out of the textbooks, but the moments you spent with them — that is what will help you on the moment when you need inspiration and encouragement. Value them. They are your best of friends.

Value your parents. I know you value them, as you are the kind of students who appreciate your parents. But believe me, wherever you go, you will always be their children and they will always love you. Listen to what they tell you. Sometimes it's those moments when you are not paying attention that you hear something that one day will become your vanguard.

Recently I was in Japan. I was listening to the Japanese people and I was telling them that one of the messages that I am trying to carry to the world is that because we have limited resources, we have to save those resources. And I was using the concept that I learned here in America a long time ago about reuse, reduce, recycle resources. I am so happy today that I saw each one of you has a tree seedling. You are the only graduating class that has ever carried a living tree seedling at their graduation ceremony. That is absolutely fantastic. That means that you have truly internalized the need for us to constantly care for this planet. Constantly take care of this little planet we call home.

In Japan, we were talking and I told them about this concept of reuse, reduce, recycle. I tried to tell them that although they are a very affluent country, I know for sure that many of the resources that they use they get from other parts of the world. It is important for them to understand that as they get these resources, there are people who are being left without them because they cannot pay the price that others can pay. And that applies to many of the rich countries in the world, especially America, which is the richest. 

Here in America many of you understand that concept of reuse, reduce recycle. So the Japanese told me that in the traditional way of life they actually have a culture of saving resources. There is a Buddhist term called mottainai and this word means: Receive the resources with respect , receive resources with gratitude. Do not waste resources. And the Japanese are losing that because they are becoming very affluent.

When I went there and talked to them, they told me they used to be very conscious of this concept of mottainai, but we are losing it. Since I went there, they have revived that concept. I want to share with you what they have produced. The last time I was there, I went to the Minister of Environment and I told her, "Now how are you carrying on with our plan for mottainai?" She told me, "I have produced a piece of cloth." The Japanese custom, before they became very affluent, was to tie gifts in a piece of cloth, which they called furoshiki. They tie it so you give the gift but you keep the cloth. So, you recycle it, you reuse it. Now, of course, we use paper and every time you use paper, remember that is a cut tree. That is a tree that has died to produce paper. Of course, we need paper. But it is very important for us to know that we can also do things to save trees.

The Minister had actually promoted the recycling of plastic. He showed me this piece of cloth, which I want to share with you. This is from recycled plastic. Recycled plastic! People like you who have the technology and who have the knowledge can actually do wonderful things with recycled materials. It really doesn't matter very much whether America, at least Washington, has signed the Kyoto Protocol or not. What is important in this wonderful country, America the Beautiful, is what the individual citizens are doing to save the environment. It is what you individually do that is important.

It is what we do individually that is important. Not what governments do or don't do. Governments can make decisions for many reasons. Sometimes the spirit is willing or the body is weak or vice versa. Sometimes it is the citizens that have to decide to take the responsibility and I am very, very proud of the fact that in this country citizens do take responsibility. Citizens do decide to hold their leaders accountable and by doing that you become an inspiration for so many other people in the world.

I attended the Expo 2005 last year and in that Expo, in Japan, I learned that every one of us needs eight trees to take care of the carbon dioxide that we exhale every year. I am very happy to know that at least every one of you graduates are taking care of your responsibilities. You have one tree that you will plant to take care of the carbon dioxide that you exhale. You can also plant for others. There are some people who don't plant. I am very happy to be able to say that the graduates of Connecticut College in 2006 at least planted one tree.

I want to close with a story that I love to tell because it is a story that reminds me of what each one of us can do. We sometimes underestimate what we can do as individuals. I want to tell you graduates: do not underestimate what each one of you will do wherever you find yourself. I want to tell you that when things become very difficult, which they will do, no matter how dark or how clouded, if you look very deeply and finely, you will always find a silver lining. Sometimes the silver lining is extremely thin, but just look and you will definitely find it. Hold onto that. That's your hope.

People ask me, what keeps you going? I say, it's the silver lining. Every experience has a lesson to teach and in that lesson you see a silver lining. If you stick to that silver lining, you will definitely rise up and keep walking because it is a journey. Today we are marking a very important part of that journey. But the long journey is still to be walked. You need to keep at it every day of your life. Look for that silver lining so that you never ever give up on your journey until the journey is done.

I want to tell you a story because it is a story of "never give up." It is a story of a forest that went on fire, a huge forest that suddenly was on fire. There was a big fire raging. All the animals came out of the forest. As they came to the edge of the forest and they started watching the fire, feeling very discouraged, feeling very disempowered. Every one of them did not think there was anything they could do about the fire except a little hummingbird. The little hummingbird said, "I can do something about this fire. I'm not going on the side to watch the forest burn." So the little hummingbird ran toward the nearest stream. (This is not my story. I got it from somebody else. It is a story from a professor who got it from America, so it has made a full circle!) The little hummingbird took a drop of water, and put it on the raging fire. Then back again and brought another drop and kept running up and down. In the meantime, the other animals are discouraging the hummingbird. They are telling it, "Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too little, you can't do much about this fire." Some of these animals that were discouraging it had big beak that could have brought more water than the hummingbird. But they weren't. They were very busy discouraging. The hummingbird decided not to be discouraged. 

It kept going up and down to get the water and put it on the burning forest. And as the animals were discouraging it, without wasting its time, the bird looked back to these other animals and saw how desperate, discouraged and persuaded they were to stay on the sidelines and not get involved. One animal said, "What do you think you are doing?" And the hummingbird, without wasting time, looked back and said, "I'm doing the best I can."

So, graduates go out there and DO the best you can. That is all you can do. The best!

Thank you. 

Good morning!

Thirty-four years ago I was standing under a tent on Westlands Lawn on a rainy day in late May, wearing a great dress that I had bought in Exeter, England, the year before, during my Junior Year Abroad. I remember it vividly: a white, gauzy Indian cotton, with a long flowing skirt; the top a tight bodice with multi-colored, jewel-tone embroidery in vertical stripes down a shirred front. My hair - like almost everyone else’s that day, including the maybe 30 guys who graduated with me in 1973 - was really long and parted in the middle; we all looked like some strange, cloned versions of Cher!

I remember my friends standing nearby, and feeling the pang of nostalgia already, knowing that our time together - as housemates in Brebner; as members of an extraordinary movement and teaching seminar led by the incomparable Katya Delakova; as intellectual explorers, discovering the previously unknown territory of Dante’s Inferno with Wolf Spitzer as our Virgil on that journey, or recognizing ourselves in the exuberant Kwakiutl with our very own shaman, the quietly masterful Irving Goldman - knowing that this time was about to end, that we would never again know each other, or be with one another, in quite the same way.

I remember my parents sitting several rows behind me, and feeling my father’s loving gaze at my back, knowing he was bursting with prideand no small degree of relief, having paid his very last Sarah Lawrence tuition bill!

What I don’t remember is who spoke that morning, or what that person said. It’s a complete blank which, under the circumstances, I find rather humbling.Okay, so fast-forward now. It’s May 2006, just a year ago. I’m sitting in a huge room, in front of a huge television screen, listening to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy*. It’s commencement at NYU. My son, Nathaniel, is graduating from Tisch, with a degree in Photography and Imaging. His father and grandmother have secured the two authorized family seats near the fountain in Washington Square Park, and my daughter, Nat’s girlfriend, and I have made our way with thousands - make that tens of thousands - of other families of graduates, to watch the processionals and hear the speeches in various remote locations. I listen to Justice Kennedy’s words, and I am moved as much by what he says, as how he says it. This gentle, thoughtful, supremely intelligent man (excuse the pun!) is literally seething with anger as he speaks - something, perhaps, Nat’s Dad and Grandmother cannot even notice without the benefit of the large screen TV.

Justice Kennedy is offering, as is expected, an exhortation to the graduates; but, he is also offering, quite astonishingly, an apology. He reminds the graduates of their imperative to advance freedom in the world; but he goes on to demand that they pursue an understanding of freedom that is not estranged from the equally essential commitment to compassion. He urges these young adults, with pronouncements that sound sibylline in their authority, to embark upon the world’s stage with a recognition of the ineluctable humanity of those we consider “other” - to remember that the abstract enemies, the denizens of nations we have reduced to being part of a hyperbolic “Axis of Evil,” are quite simply as real as we are, children of loving parents, parents of remarkable children, and sisters and brothers and cousins and coworkers and friends and neighbors And, as the Justice speaks these words, he is visibly shaken, his chin quivering, his anger palpable, his deep shame suggested by the stunning admission he voices, that we - our generation - has failed you; we have let you down we have left you a world to inherit that, despite the rhetoric of our youth and the promise of the “Sixties,” we have left you a world that is far worse and much more vulnerable than the one we inherited from our own parents.

I sit mesmerized, listening to him. I can’t wait to talk to Nat about this shattering indictment of my own era, this fervent call to humanism, that might - if only it were possible! - make this world a better place. I run to find Nat in the crowds. We meet at the appointed spot, just outside the Tisch building on Broadway. As the words bubble out of my mouth about this amazing commencement address, and how incredibly privileged he and his friends must feel to have been given this impassioned charge as they leave their alma mater, he looks at me and blankly says, “Mom, I had to get up so early this morning to pick up the cap and gown, I just slept through the whole program. Did anyone say anything that really matters?”

Okay. I am going to assume that no one under the age of about 45 in this crowd is going to remember a darn thing I’m about to say. So, if you feel like it, go ahead, take a nap! You deserve it! You’ve worked hard to get to this day. And, I’m going to spend some time talking to your parents. It’s their rite of passage too. And, I know they’re listening to every word. After all, they paid for it!

When Michele Myers called last spring and offered me the honor of speaking at commencement, she advised me to: “keep it short, and make it funny!” Unfortunately, I don’t do short, and as someone who has devoted her professional life to the darker chapters of history, I’m not often called upon to do “funny.” So, I beg your indulgence this morning. We’re going to talk about serious things; things, I think, that matter.

As a historian, I think about the past. But, as a parent, I think about the future. What struck me most about Justice Kennedy’s admonitions a year ago was the question behind his comments: what kind of world have we left our children? Thirty-four years ago, when I sat here, the world was a very different place. We were of a generation that believed in our own agency to change the world. We stood up to power, and we forced, by sheer will and a sense of common moral imperative that was greater than any one of us alone, the end of a senseless war that had drafted our friends into combat, and too often, took the lives of our peers for a cause none of us could defend.

We entered our twenties filled with a sense of promise and of potential. We believed we could carry this moral fervor into the arena of our professional lives and make a difference. I would like to believe that we tried to honor that promise.

But, something happened along the way. Here we are, sending our beautiful, accomplished, and yes, pampered, children off into a world that is struggling to right itself, a world in which insecurity is the global norm, our environment is at grave risk, and no matter where we live, the specter of terrifying unpredictability hovers. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust and the lessons of Hiroshima some six decades ago, genocide continues unstopped in the deserts of Darfur, and the world community continues to play a very dangerous game of brinksmanship with weapons of mass destruction.

We seem to have forgotten the important lessons - lessons that are very much at the heart of a Sarah Lawrence education: that individual dignity must be acknowledged for community to thrive; and, that our sense of belonging must extend beyond the limits of our immediate self-interests to take in a larger landscape of possibility, one that can best be encountered through rigorous, intellectual inquiry; curiosity about the unfamiliar, and non-judgmental openness to the “other.”
We forget such lessons at our own peril. But, how can we ensure that our children remember them? Why does memory matter?

That question has been the singular focus of my career. Let me share some of what I’ve learned along the way

There is a wonderful teacher of philosophy at Claremont-McKenna College, John K. Roth, who has written a great deal about what he calls the “ethics of memory:”

“Memories are not entirely in our control,” Roth tells us. “For one reason or another - physiological or psychological - we may lose them. Without memories we could scarcely be moral creatures, for history would dissolve and we would be able neither to identify one another as persons nor to make connections on which moral decisions depend. But given the fact that we do have memories, we are creatures who cannot avoid responsibility and moral responsibility in particular.”

Roth goes on to cite Elie Wiesel’s sobering alarm: “If we stop remembering, we stop being.” With Wiesel as his starting point, Roth then makes the Alzheimers’ analogy: “Especially as we age, we can understand Wiesel’s point in our personal lives. We dread memory loss; it means an enfeebled life. And at the end of the day, there is definitely a sense in which we stop existing when we can no longer remember.”

If we extend the personal experience to the communal, it would seem logical that, if loss of memory leads to a diminishment of being a whole person, of “being” in Wiesel’s words, then to forget history means that we, collectively, run the risk of being diminished as a society, or simply put, we become a society of diminished human beings.

My 19-year affiliation with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum taught me many other lessons about memory. I came to understand there that the space between cognitive understanding and emotional intelligence is where memory resides.

Let me give you two examples:

In 2005, during the week when the country mourned the loss of civil rights activist, Rosa Parks, and her body lay in repose at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, every bus in Montgomery County, Maryland, carried a sign on a seat at the front of the bus: it read simply, “Reserved for Rosa Parks.” This simple gesture - to leave a seat empty - conveyed more than the words themselves could express: a sense of respect; an affirmation of shared history, and a celebration of the power of collective memory to compel reflection, if not action.

Here’s another example: in Berlin - a city quite literally sprouting with memorials - there is a small, rather subtle, but omnipresent memorial scattered across the city, around the country, and I understand other countries; and, it is surprisingly effective. It is the Stolpersteine project (which means, literally, “stumbling stones”). You’ll be walking down a street, and as you pass a house, there’s a small, brass-topped cobblestone set into the pavement at your feet. Inscribed on the cobblestone is a simple set of facts, something like this: “Here lived Alice Greenwald, born January 2, 1918. Deported May 24, 1943.” These stones are not only there as markers; they are quite literally, stumbling stones; they are meant to “trip you up” - cognitively, psychologically, and spiritually.

So, what’s the connection between the buses in Maryland and the stones in Berlin?

Both point to absence and the encounter with the void. Through the lens of absence, we are brought to another level of understanding. We can see the world differently.

My current work at the World Trade Center Memorial Museum is quite literally centered on the void. It will be located at an historic site that today - five-and-a-half years after the singular cataclysmic event of our lifetimes - is still mostly about absence, about what isn’t there. A 7-story deep, 16-acre hole dominates the urban landscape of lower Manhattan. This scar is as much psychic as it is physical; and, as essential to the process of memorialization - of integrating the still unimaginable facts into our historical consciousness - as is the dedicated, and I’m happy to report, advancing, effort to rebuild at the site.

But, how can we accomplish what is implicit in Professor Roth’s observations about memory: how can we ensure that, through the alchemy of the act of remembering, this place might become a site of conscience?

Memorial museums, those like the Holocaust Museum, that are not where the events took place, and those like Oklahoma City, where they are, are ultimately about the way we remember.

The Holocaust Museum, for example, has a dedicated focus. It is very self-consciously not a “museum of genocides.” Rather, it is a museum dedicated to the memory of a particular genocide, an event of such magnitude, it actually gave birth to the word “genocide” itself.

In this intense particularity, the Holocaust Museum is able to speak to something bigger than the history it represents. It speaks to conscience, and the need to act in the face of genocide. Last Thanksgiving weekend, for example, the Museum projected images of Darfur onto the exterior walls of the Hall of Remembrance, which itself projects out physically toward Raoul Wallenberg Place, transforming the entire enterprise of Holocaust memory, demanding that the building itself become an agent of active witness. Just last month, the Museum partnered with GoogleEarth to stream live satellite images from Darfur, 24/7, so that no one can say they weren’t aware, or deny what is happening there. With the world brought to you on your PC, the whole notion of what it means to be an eyewitness has been fundamentally changed.

At Ground Zero, we, too, have an opportunity - and an OBLIGATION - to remember well so that the intense and immediate particularity of 9/11, can speak to bigger concerns.
Our first priority will be, of course, to honor the commemorative and memorial functions of the site, to recognize that lives were lost here.

Secondly, the specificity of what happened will be our primary story - not just the horrific events of the day - but also the response of the community, the uniformed rescue personnel, New Yorkers, Americans from every state, the world community.

But, ultimately, the story must be about the people affected by this event - and the recognition that this is a story about people; people like us - who got up in the morning and went to work, and got caught in the vortex of global events.

People ask: Will this be a museum about terrorism?

As a memorial museum, this place will focus on the very real impact of terrorism on the lives of very real people, and their families, friends, colleagues and communities.
And, by focusing on the human story, this museum will, we hope, become a moral platform attesting to the indefensibility of terrorism, to the absolute unacceptability of indiscriminate mass murder as a response to grievance.

But, here is where we - as a community, a nation, and a civilization - keep missing the point, forgetting the lessons. It is the grievances we must focus on, and try to make sense of, not the terrorism. Despite the rhetoric, terrorist attacks don’t, in reality, strike abstractions like “the West” or “American values,” they strike people - people like you and me, the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and cousins Justice Kennedy affirmed. People make up the world. And, so, we need to change our frame, and stop thinking about us and them, as if these categories were monolithic. We must begin to understand that the world is a big, and deeply interconnected and essentially interdependent, community of individuals.

At Sarah Lawrence, this recognition has always been at the heart of what is meant by “education.” Everyone at SLC is valued for having something unique to offer, and is encouraged to dig deep and meet audacious challenges. Through the lens of deep inquiry and the catnip of curiosity encouraged by small-sized seminars, and the donning, conference, and in my time, the “contract,” programs, we all learned what it means to learn.

There is a terrific story about the great American inventor, architect, and visionary Buckminster Fuller who was once asked by a student: “Professor Fuller, do you think there is life in outer space?” “Young man,” he answered, “just where do you think you are?”

The frame through which we look at ourselves and the world is key. As a freshman at Sarah Lawrence, I read Tonio Kröger with my don, Harold S. L. Wiener, and that one remarkable short story helped frame for me the core (and continuing) challenge of modern Europe in terms of the urgent need to bridge nationalistic divisions as a prerequisite for economic and social vitality, creativity and productivity. Another work by Thomas Mann became the focus of a semester-long project with Hyman Kleinman. As we read The Magic Mountain together, one on one, in the fall of 1972, and as I struggled to make sense of the diseased Europe that Mann chronicled, I had no idea how much that experience would help to frame my own understanding of the very history I would later be charged to tell at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

What will frame the views for this generation? [And, now, I want to talk to ALL of you 

What books have you read during your years at Sarah Lawrence; what conversations with your dons and teachers and roommates and fellow students have polished the lens for the ways in which you will now contribute to the world? Has Orhan Pamuk’s Snow framed for you a clearer understanding of the defining clash between legacies of tradition and rationalism in the 21st century, your century? Was it perhaps another book? Another discipline entirely?
You know, there was a great scene in the TV series, The West Wing, where these brash, energetic, self-absorbed White House power brokers suddenly looked at their world through a different lens. They realized that they would have the “stage” for only a limited time; that there was just this one window of opportunity when they might actually change the world. I often remind my staff at the World Trade Center Memorial Museum about this - what a unique, if temporary, privilege we have.

But, you don’t need to be in the White House or on the ground floor of an important civic project to have that privilege.

This is your moment on the stage. Take what you’ve learned at Sarah Lawrence and allow it to polish the lens on the world you are about to engage. Don’t forget that it is a privilege to be here. Not today on Westlands lawn, not Sarah Lawrence College, but here in the world. “Being” - in Elie Wiesel’s sense of the word - is a both a privilege and an obligation. I realize this is hard to grasp, but you’ve only got a short time here not as short as four or eight years in the White House, but short enough. Dig as deep as you have to, and rise as high as you can. Keep your passion. Make mistakes and learn from them. Honor curiosity and follow it. And, in everything you do, recognize the individuals in the other.

And, every once in a while, take stock of where you have come from and how it leads to where you are and where you want to be. Professor Kristin Hass at the University of Michigan has written about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and observed that, “memorials are the way we make promises to the future about the past.” Think carefully about the promises you are willing to make, and transform the memory of your time at Sarah Lawrence into the work of “being” in the world.

The ancient Jewish sage, Rabbi Tarfon, charged: “It is not your responsibility to finish the work of [perfecting the world], but you are not free to desist from it either.” [Pirke Avot, 2:16]

Go forth, now. Don’t desist. And, maybe, in 30 years, one or more of you will be invited back to this podium to give a commencement speech - and you won’t recall who spoke on the day you graduated - but you will remember the gifts of your time at Sarah Lawrence and how they gave you the courage and the competency to look at your world through a different lens, and maybe, even, to polish the view for others.

Thank you.

President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates:

I’ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this: “Dad, I always told you I’d come back and get my degree.”

I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I’ll be changing my job next year … and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume.

I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I’m just happy that the Crimson has called me “Harvard’s most successful dropout.” I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class … I did the best of everyone who failed.

But I also want to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop out of business school. I’m a bad influence. That’s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I had spoken at your orientation, fewer of you might be here today.

Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn’t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn’t worry about getting up in the morning. That’s how I came to be the leader of the anti-social group. We clung to each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people.Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there, and most of the guys were science-math types. That combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. This is where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn’t guarantee success.

One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975, when I made a call from Currier House to a company in Albuquerque that had begun making the world’s first personal computers. I offered to sell them software.

I worried that they would realize I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said: “We’re not quite ready, come see us in a month,” which was a good thing, because we hadn’t written the software yet. From that moment, I worked day and night on this little extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.

What I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging, but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege – and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on.

But taking a serious look back … I do have one big regret.

I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world – the appalling disparities of health, and wealth, and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of despair.

I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas in economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences.

But humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries – but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity – reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries.

It took me decades to find out.

You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the world’s inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here, I hope you’ve had a chance to think about how – in this age of accelerating technology – we can finally take on these inequities, and we can solve them.

Imagine, just for the sake of discussion, that you had a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause – and you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it?

For Melinda and for me, the challenge is the same: how can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have.

During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis B, yellow fever. One disease I had never even heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million kids each year – none of them in the United States.

We were shocked. We had just assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar, there were interventions that could save lives that just weren’t being delivered.

If you believe that every life has equal value, it’s revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves: “This can’t be true. But if it is true, it deserves to be the priority of our giving.”

So we began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked: “How could the world let these children die?”

The answer is simple, and harsh. The market did not reward saving the lives of these children, and governments did not subsidize it. So the children died because their mothers and their fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system.

But you and I have both.

We can make market forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism – if we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit, or at least make a living, serving people who are suffering from the worst inequities. We also can press governments around the world to spend taxpayer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes.

If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world.
This task is open-ended. It can never be finished. But a conscious effort to answer this challenge will change the world.

I am optimistic that we can do this, but I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say: “Inequity has been with us since the beginning, and will be with us till the end – because people just … don’t … care.”
I completely disagree.

I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.

All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing – not because we didn’t care, but because we didn’t know what to do. If we had known how to help, we would have acted.

The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much complexity.

To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.

Even with the advent of the Internet and 24-hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems. When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference. They promise to investigate, determine the cause, and prevent similar crashes in the future.

But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say: “Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, one half of one percent of them were on this plane. We’re determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of the one half of one percent.”

The bigger problem is not the plane crash, but the millions of preventable deaths.

We don’t read much about these deaths. The media covers what’s new – and millions of people dying is nothing new. So it stays in the background, where it’s easier to ignore. But even when we do see it or read about it, it’s difficult to keep our eyes on the problem. It’s hard to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don’t know how to help. And so we look away.

If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step: cutting through the complexity to find a solution.

Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers anytime an organization or individual asks “How can I help?,” then we can get action – and we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted. But complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares — and that makes it hard for their caring to matter.

Cutting through complexity to find a solution runs through four predictable stages: determine a goal, find the highest-leverage approach, discover the ideal technology for that approach, and in the meantime, make the smartest application of the technology that you already have — whether it’s something sophisticated, like a drug, or something simpler, like a bednet.

The AIDS epidemic offers an example. The broad goal, of course, is to end the disease. The highest-leverage approach is prevention. The ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives lifetime immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies, and foundations fund vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade, so in the meantime, we have to work with what we have in hand – and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior.

Pursuing that goal starts the four-step cycle again. This is the pattern. The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working – and never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century – which is to surrender to complexity and quit.

The final step – after seeing the problem and finding an approach – is to measure the impact of your work and share your successes and failures so that others learn from your efforts.

You have to have the statistics, of course. You have to be able to show that a program is vaccinating millions more children. You have to be able to show a decline in the number of children dying from these diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program, but also to help draw more investment from business and government.

But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers; you have to convey the human impact of the work – so people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected.

I remember going to Davos some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives. Millions! Think of the thrill of saving just one person’s life – then multiply that by millions. … Yet this was the most boring panel I’ve ever been on – ever. So boring even I couldn’t bear it.

What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement. I love getting people excited about software – but why can’t we generate even more excitement for saving lives?

You can’t get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact. And how you do that – is a complex question.

Still, I’m optimistic. Yes, inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new – they can help us make the most of our caring – and that’s why the future can be different from the past.

The defining and ongoing innovations of this age – biotechnology, the computer, the Internet – give us a chance we’ve never had before to end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease.

Sixty years ago, George Marshall came to this commencement and announced a plan to assist the nations of post-war Europe. He said: “I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. It is virtually impossible at this distance to grasp at all the real significance of the situation.”

Thirty years after Marshall made his address, as my class graduated without me, technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant.

The emergence of low-cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating.

The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbor. It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can have working together on the same problem – and that scales up the rate of innovation to a staggering degree.

At the same time, for every person in the world who has access to this technology, five people don’t. That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion — smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience who don’t have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world.

We need as many people as possible to have access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in what human beings can do for one another. They are making it possible not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, smaller organizations, and even individuals to see problems, see approaches, and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty, and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago.

Members of the Harvard Family: Here in the Yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world.

What for?

There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students, and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name?

Let me make a request of the deans and the professors – the intellectual leaders here at Harvard: As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum, and determine degree requirements, please ask yourselves:

Should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems?

Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world’s worst inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty … the prevalence of world hunger … the scarcity of clean water …the girls kept out of school … the children who die from diseases we can cure?

Should the world’s most privileged people learn about the lives of the world’s least privileged?

These are not rhetorical questions – you will answer with your policies.

My mother, who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here – never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she said: “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.”

When you consider what those of us here in this Yard have been given – in talent, privilege, and opportunity – there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.

In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue – a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career, that would be phenomenal. But you don’t have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the Internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers, and find ways to cut through them.

Don’t let complexity stop you. Be activists. Take on the big inequities. It will be one of the great experiences of your lives.

You graduates are coming of age in an amazing time. As you leave Harvard, you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity, which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment you if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with very little effort.
You have more than we had; you must start sooner, and carry on longer.

Knowing what you know, how could you not?

And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone, but also on how well you have addressed the world’s deepest inequities … on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity.

Good luck.

Good Afternoon faculty, parents, and Class of 2007. That has a nice ring to it... Class of 2007. That's you. Someday someone will ask you when you graduated and they'll say "…Wow...way back in '07..." I am honored to be here today. I especially like wearing the robes. I feel as though I am now one of the tribal elders. As a Sportscaster for ESPN, I'm often asked to make appearances and speeches. It's part of what we do. Corporations, charities, Bristol Little League... but a commencement is different. It is an auspicious occasion with weight and permanence; it is an important milestone in life. Some of you might be asking, why then is a Sportscaster speaking at my child's commencement? Many of our sports debates on SportsCenter don't exactly lead you to believe we operate in a haven of intellectualism but actually, we do. ESPN is filled with bright, creative, highly motivated people who love their jobs. And when you love what you do the rest will follow, but before I plunge into more on that, what I'm here to do is welcome the Class of 2007 to the rest of your life. If you have your job and career lined up, you're ahead of the game, but I would imagine most of you are wondering, "Well…What do I do now?"

Here's a top 8 to help you enter the Rest of your Life. I would have made it a top 10, but we want to keep this whole thing moving.

NUMBER ONE: If you don't know what you want to do, at least know what you DON'T want to do. When I was a kid, I would occasionally go into work with my father. My father grew up on a bog farm in Ireland. For some reason, bog farming was what my father DIDN'T want to do. So he came over to New York City and became a policeman. Eventually he became a decorated detective. He would occasionally bring me into work with him. I couldn't believe he would actually look out his precinct window and see the Empire State Building. It was thrilling, but I also saw other things. On the way in, we'd take the commuter train, and it'd be packed with men in suits, all dressed up, everybody crammed in - sweating profusely. They'd spend a good 3 hours a day, five days a week on that train. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew what I DIDN'T want to do, and it was that. I wasn't going to be joining the lemmings as they lined up, and walked off the edge of that train platform. I didn't know exactly where I would end up, but I knew I wanted to be a reporter, and I set out to make that happen.

NUMBER TWO: Do what interests you. You will be making important choices over the next few years. Eventually find what you love to do, and pour yourself into it. You do not want to dread driving to work every day. You'll be at your best, by the way, when you're happy. When you feel joy. Even when I was a cub reporter covering little league games in some tiny town, I always liked going to work. It didn't matter what I was getting paid. Eventually I hoped to be paid well, but I enjoyed each day and each day I paid attention to my craft. It was thirteen years before I landed at ESPN. Thirteen years of hard work and paying for diapers and baby formula with change from the car ashtray. It was worth every sacrifice. Do what you love.

NUMBER THREE: There's No THERE, THERE. That's from the writer Gertrude Stein. She's right. There's not there. That elusive "there" with the job, the beach house, the dream, it's not out there. There is here. It's in you... right now. That real happiness, real contentment has to be IN you regardless of professional achievement and amount of wealth. It's not magically appearing with a job and a paycheck. When you're young and struggling it's easy to think; "If I could just get that job... get that girl... get that guy... that car... that house…that salary..." “If I could just get THERE... I would have it all." I could finally be happy. BUT THERE'S NOT THERE. I'll give you an example: I host a boxing show called Friday Night Fights. Each week, we bring in a boxer to interview. Now most of these men are World Champions. I deal ONLY in the winner's bracket. I don't even see the guys who lose! And yet ALL these men tell the same story - they work, and work, and work. Literally fighting their way to the top - in obscurity, for years. All the time thinking, "When I'm champ…when I'm champ…things are going to be different when I'm the champ". That elusive goal achieved by SO FEW... and when those VERY FEW actually get there, they realize, nothing's changed. The money is usually a bit better, but you can still end up just as broke. You can have a bigger entourage, but you don't know how many of them are truly your friends. Fans might treat you with more respect, but if you didn't get there already feeling like you were already championship caliber, it doesn't magically come over you. Reaching your goals doesn't change who you are; believe me. When I boxed, I trained alongside a kid in Upstate New York. The teenager couldn't wait to be champ, and thought ALL would be great when he won the heavyweight title and fulfilled his destiny. This kid COULD NOT MISS. And he actually accomplished what he set out to do. I'm talking about Mike Tyson. He found that winning the title was the beginning of the journey, not the end. Achievement and wealth were not an elixir for his problems. No there. Remember that. You are THERE, now.

NUMBER FOUR: Life is Short, BUT, actually might go on for a long time, so you'd better become good at something. In just a few years you will go to your High School reunion, the 10-yr reunion. It's coming sooner than you think. Something to think about: Not everyone will make it. I don't mean their car will break down. I mean they will not be alive. At my 10-yr reunion, 2 "didn't make it.” I'll use that euphemism. Then at my 20-yr reunion, 8 "didn't make it". I haven't had my 30-yr yet, but I can only imagine that trend continues. So, as we say at the NFL Draft, "You're on the clock". Your life is well underway. At the same time, I think it's important to heed to the advice of Basketball Coach John Wooden. Wooden, who coached UCLA to 10 NCAA Championships and has one himself as a player told his teams: "LIVE as though you'll die tomorrow... LEARN as though you'll live forever." That bears repeating. "LIVE as though you'll die tomorrow... LEARN as though you'll live forever." Wooden is famous for starting the first day of practice teaching the team... what? Any one know? HOW to tie their sneakers. Fundamentals... attention to detail... Tie your sneakers like you mean it!!! Wooden did not watch game film of other teams. He paid attention to HIS craft, the fundamentals of HIS team...And he filled the shelf with Championship trophies. John Wooden, by the way, lives in California and is 96 years old. So life is short, but you, too, might be in it for quite a long haul.

NUMBER FIVE: ENTHUSIASM AND DESIRE I knew a soccer coach who was once a member of the Hungarian National Team. Quite a player, quite a coach. I spent many days covering his college teams. They were always winners. I can still hear his voice bellowing in a Hungarian accent across that soccer field: ENTHUSIASM AND DESIRE!!!!!! If you're already spending the time at work or at play, ENTHUSIASTICALLY learn your craft. Find balance, certainly, but while you're on the job and in everything you do in life... give it everything you have. If you haven't done that yet, there's still plenty of time. Prepare yourself. You're already doing your part. You're here today, getting your degree from Ohio Northern University. IT'S A GREAT DAY TO BE A POLAR BEAR! Enthusiasm and Desire!

NUMBER SIX: This is my favorite... "Challenge The Orthodoxy" We all grow up having to listen to those in authority. And there is, ingrained in us, a predisposition to think that "THEY" must know what they're doing. If you've been paying attention to what's going on in this country, you already know, this is not true. Rather than illustrate with our foreign policy, let's talk football. In a study done by an economist at Berkeley, it was found that anytime it's 4th down and 4, or closer than 4 yards, you should go for it. DO NOT PUNT! Don Shula himself, the winningest coach in NFL history, a man who grew up here in northern Ohio, was once asked, "Is there any big innovation left in football?" Shula said, "Someday there will be a coach that doesn't punt." So economists, mathematicians, and Don Shula are all calling for it. Why doesn't someone do it? The answer is FEAR. Fear of standing out from the crowd. Fear of challenging the accepted norm. If this happens in football with everyone watching, how many things like this are happening in corporations, in schools, and in government. Just because it's been done a certain way for eons doesn't mean it's the best way of getting it done. Challenge the orthodoxy.

NUMBER SEVEN: Help people to help yourself. I was doing a corporate meeting for one of the big insurance companies, and their new CEO got up in front of his best salespeople and told them his secret to corporate success. Surprisingly enough it was not, “Stab as many in back as possible.” He said he used to see anyone coming into his office as an annoyance. Everybody NEEDED something. He was always, as they say, “putting out fires.” He said his career changed the moment he realized that as a person and as an executive he was there to help these people. When someone came to him, he started to say, "How can I help YOU?” “What can I do for YOU?" "What do YOU need?" That Care for others came back to him EXPONENTIALLY in ways he never anticipated. He climbed right up the ladder. Yes, it's the best way to live. We know that. Turns out, it's the best thing for your career.

NUMBER EIGHT:

"The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life." Muhammad Ali said that. Even with all the study and all the living you've done to this point, you're only just starting. You must CONTINUE TO EVOLVE in your thinking and in your views on life. You must continue to learn. Surround yourself with bright, positive people. Be open. Be inquisitive. There's a saying, "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room".

That's all 8. You might not remember one single thing. But remember this, THERE, is here, breathe deep, you're there. Savor this moment. Look around at your classmates. This is a day you will always remember. There will only be one, just like this. After the ceremony, look into the eyes of your parents, or your grandparents, or whoever helped you here this day. Thank them. Tell them you love them. Savor the moment. Enjoy it all.

Congratulations, Class of 2007. 

Thank you, President Hennessy and good morning class of 2007. It is a great honor to be asked to give the Commencement address at my alma mater. Although I have two degrees from Stanford, I still feel a bit like an interloper on this exquisitely beautiful campus. A person never really escapes his or her childhood.

At heart I’m still a working-class kid, half Italian, half Mexican, from L.A., or more precisely from Hawthorne, a city that most of this audience knows only as the setting of Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, two films that capture the ineffable charm of my hometown.

Today is Father’s Day, so I hope you will indulge me for beginning on a personal note. I am the first person in my family ever to attend college and I owe my education to my father who sacrificed nearly everything to give his four children the best education possible.

My dad had a fairly hard life. He never spoke English until he went to school. He barely survived a plane crash in World War II. He worked hard, but never had much success, except with his family.When I was about 12, my dad told me that he hoped I would go to Stanford, a place I had never heard of. For him, Stanford represented every success he had missed in his but wanted for his children. He would be proud of me today, no matter how dull my speech.

On the other hand, I may be fortunate that my mother isn’t here. It isn’t Mother’s Day, so I can be honest. I loved her dearly but she could be a challenge. For example, when she learned I had been nominated to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, she phoned and said, “Don’t think this impresses me.”

I know that there was a bit of controversy when my name was announced as the graduation speaker. A few students were especially concerned that I lacked celebrity status. It seemed I wasn’t famous enough. I couldn’t agree more. As I have often told my wife and children, “I’m simply not famous enough.”

That, in a more general and less personal sense, is the subject I want to address today, the fact that we live in a culture that barely acknowledges and rarely celebrates the arts or artists.There is an experiment I’d love to conduct. I’d like to survey a cross-section of Americans and ask them how many active NBA players, Major League Baseball players, and American Idol finalists they can name.Then I’d ask them how many living American poets, playwrights, painters, sculptors, architects, classical musicians, conductors, and composers they can name.

I’d even like to ask how many living American scientists or social thinkers they can name.Fifty years ago, I suspect that along with Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, and Sandy Koufax, most Americans could have named, at the very least, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Arthur Miller, Thornton Wilder, Georgia O’Keeffe, Leonard Bernstein, Leontyne Price, and Frank Lloyd Wright and many others, not to mention scientists and thinkers like Linus Pauling, Jonas Salk, Rachel Carson, Margaret Mead, and especially Dr. Alfred Kinsey.I don’t think that Americans were smarter then, but American culture was. Even the mass media placed a greater emphasis on presenting a broad range of human achievement.

I grew up mostly among immigrants, many of whom never learned to speak English but at night watching TV variety programs like the Ed Sullivan Show or the Perry Como Music Hall, I saw, along with comedians, popular singers, and movie stars, classical musicians like Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein, opera singers like Robert Merrill and Anna Moffo, and jazz greats like Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong captivate an audience of millions with their art.

The same was even true of literature. I first encountered Robert Frost, John Steinbeck, Lillian Hellman, and James Baldwin on general interest TV shows. All of these people were famous to the average American because the culture considered them important.Today no working-class or immigrant kid would encounter that range of arts and ideas in the popular culture. Almost everything in our national culture, even the news, has been reduced to entertainment, or altogether eliminated.

The loss of recognition for artists, thinkers, and scientists has impoverished our culture in innumerable ways but let me mention one. When virtually all of a culture’s celebrated figures are in sports or entertainment, how few possible role models we offer the young.There are so many other ways to lead a successful and meaningful life that are not denominated by money or fame. Adult life begins in a child’s imagination, and we’ve relinquished that imagination to the marketplace.

Of course, I’m not forgetting that politicians can also be famous, I work in Washington, but it is interesting how our political process grows more like the entertainment industry each year. When a successful guest appearance on the Colbert Report becomes more important than passing legislation, democracy gets scary. No wonder Hollywood considers politics “show business for ugly people.”

Everything now is entertainment and the purpose of this omnipresent commercial entertainment is to sell us something. American culture has mostly become one vast infomercial.

I have a reoccurring nightmare. I am in Rome visiting the Sistine Chapel. I look up at Michelangelo’s incomparable fresco of the “Creation of Man.” I see God stretching out his arm to touch the reclining Adam’s finger and then I notice in the other hand Adam is holding a Diet Pepsi.

When was the last time you have seen a featured guest on David Letterman or Jay Leno who isn’t trying to sell you something? A new movie, a new TV show, a new book, or a new vote?Don’t get me wrong. I love entertainment, and I love the free market. I have a Stanford MBA and spent 15 years in the food industry. I adore my big-screen TV. The productivity and efficiency of the free market is beyond dispute. It has created a society of unprecedented prosperity.

We must remember that the marketplace does only one thing. It puts a price on everything.The role of culture, however, must go beyond economics. It is not focused on the price of things but on their value. Above all, culture should tell us what is beyond price, including what does not belong in the marketplace. A culture should also provide some cogent view of the good life beyond mass accumulation. In this respect, our culture is failing us.

There is only one social force in America potentially large and strong enough to counterbalance this profit-driven commercialization of cultural values, our educational system, especially public education. Traditionally, education has been one thing that our nation has agreed cannot be left entirely to the marketplace but made mandatory and freely available to everyone.

At 56, I am just old enough to remember a time when every public high school in this country had a music program with choir and band, usually a jazz band, too, sometimes even orchestra. Every high school offered a drama program, sometimes with dance instruction. There were writing opportunities in the school paper and literary magazine, as well as studio art training.I am sorry to say that these programs are no longer widely available to the new generation of Americans. This once visionary and democratic system has been almost entirely dismantled by well-meaning but myopic school boards, county commissioners, and state officials, with the federal government largely indifferent to the issue. Art became an expendable luxury and 50 million students have paid the price. Today a child’s access to arts education is largely a function of his or her parents’ income.

In a time of social progress and economic prosperity, why have we experienced this colossal cultural and political decline? There are several reasons, but I must risk offending many friends and colleagues by saying that surely artists and intellectuals are partly to blame. Most American artists, intellectuals, and academics have lost their ability to converse with the rest of society. We have become wonderfully expert in talking to each other but we have become almost invisible and inaudible in the general culture.

This mutual estrangement has had enormous cultural, social, and political consequences. America needs its artists and intellectuals and they need to reestablish their rightful place in the general culture. If we could reopen the conversation between our best minds and the broader public, the results would not only transform society but also artistic and intellectual life.

There is no better place to start this rapprochement than in arts education. How do we explain to the larger society the benefits of this civic investment when they have been convinced that the purpose of arts education is mostly to produce more artists, hardly a compelling argument to either the average taxpayer or financially strapped school board?

We need to create a new national consensus. The purpose of arts education is not to produce more artists, although that is a byproduct. The real purpose of arts education is to create complete human beings capable of leading successful and productive lives in a free society.

This is not happening now in American schools. Even if you forget the larger catastrophe that only 70 percent of American kids now graduate from high school, what are we to make of a public education system whose highest goal seems to be producing minimally competent entry-level workers?The situation is a cultural and educational disaster, but it also has huge and alarming economic consequences. If the United States is to compete effectively with the rest of the world in the new global marketplace, it is not going to succeed through cheap labor or cheap raw materials, nor even the free flow of capital or a streamlined industrial base. To compete successfully, this country needs continued creativity, ingenuity, and innovation.

It is hard to see those qualities thriving in a nation whose educational system ranks at the bottom of the developed world and has mostly eliminated the arts from the curriculum.I have seen firsthand the enormous transformative power of the arts, in the lives of individuals, in communities, and even society at large.

Marcus Aurelius believed that the course of wisdom consisted of learning to trade easy pleasures for more complex and challenging ones. I worry about a culture that bit by bit trades off the challenging pleasures of art for the easy comforts of commercial entertainment. That is exactly what is happening, not just in the media, but in our schools and civic life.

Entertainment promises us a predictable pleasure—humor, thrills, emotional titillation, or even the odd delight of being vicariously terrified. It exploits and manipulates who we are rather than challenges us with a vision of who we might become. A child who spends a month mastering Halo or NBA Live on Xbox has not been awakened and transformed the way that child would be spending the time rehearsing a play or learning to draw.

If you don’t believe me, you should read the statistical studies that are now coming out about American civic participation. Our country is dividing into two distinct behavioral groups. One group spends most of its free time sitting at home as passive consumers of electronic entertainment. Even family communication is breaking down as members increasingly spend their time alone, staring at their individual screens.

The other group also uses and enjoys the new technology but these individuals balance it with a broader range of activities. They go out to exercise, play sports, volunteer and do charity work at about three times the level of the first group. By every measure they are vastly more active and socially engaged.

What is the defining difference between passive and active citizens? Curiously, it isn’t income, geography, or even education. It depends on whether or not they read for pleasure and participate in the arts. These cultural activities seem to awaken a heightened sense of individual awareness and social responsibility.

Why do these issues matter to you? This is the culture you are about to enter. For the last few years you have had the privilege of being at one of the world’s greatest universities, not only studying, but being a part of a community that takes arts and ideas seriously. Even if you spent most of your free time watching Grey’s Anatomy, playing Guitar Hero, or Facebooking your friends, those important endeavors were balanced by courses and conversations about literature, politics, technology, and ideas.

Distinguished graduates, your support system is about to end. You now face the choice of whether you want to be a passive consumer or an active citizen. Do you want to watch the world on a screen or live in it so meaningfully that you change it?That’s no easy task, so don’t forget what the arts provide.

Art is an irreplaceable way of understanding and expressing the world, equal to but distinct from scientific and conceptual methods. Art addresses us in the fullness of our being, simultaneously speaking to our intellect, emotions, intuition, imagination, memory, and physical senses. There are some truths about life that can be expressed only as stories, or songs, or images.

Art delights, instructs, consoles. It educates our emotions. It remembers. As Robert Frost once said about poetry, “It is a way of remembering that which it would impoverish us to forget.” Art awakens, enlarges, refines, and restores our humanity. You don’t outgrow art. The same work can mean something different at each stage of your life. A good book changes as you change.

Let me conclude on a personal note. My own art is poetry, though my current daily life sometimes makes me forget that. So let me end my remarks with a short poem appropriate to the occasion.

Praise to the rituals that celebrate change,
old robes worn for new beginnings,
solemn protocol where the mutable soul,
surrounded by ancient experience, grows
young in the imagination’s white dress.

Because it is not the rituals we honor
but our trust in what they signify, these rites
that honor us as witnesses, whether to watch
lovers swear loyalty in a careless world
or a newborn washed with water and oil.

So praise to innocence, impulsive and evergreen
and let the old be touched by youth’s
wayward astonishment at learning something new,
and dream of a future so fitting and so just
that our desire will bring it into being.

Congratulations to the Class of 2007.

Wake Forest Class of 2007, you’ve earned this.

You didn’t just begin working for this day four years ago. You’ve been working for this your whole lives. I can see you now as third graders coming out of your elementary schools after a long hard day of college prep.

You’re lugging those 80-pound backpacks that hard-working third graders wear. If the wind blows you over you’re like beetles stuck there on the ground.

Some of you are coming out of that school and you’re getting picked up by a creature I’ve been studying over the years called Ubermom. These are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids are perfect. You can usually tell the ubermoms because they actually weigh less than their children.

They come up to the elementary schools driving Audis, Saabs and Volvos, because in certain corners it’s socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy.

Even at the moment of conception they’re doing little exercises to stay fit and trim and figuring out what to wear at their child’s Wake Forest commencement ceremony. During pregnancy they are taking so much soy-based nutritional formula they produce these massive 12-pound babies that look like toothless defensive linemen.

The moms are in the delivery room cutting the umbilical cord themselves, adjusting the video lighting and asking the ultimate ubermom question: Is her Apgar score above average? To be whisked off to the gifted and talented ward of Wake Forest bound infants.

Then on the way home, they’re flashing math flash cards at the thing, trying to begin its SAT prep. And to make their baby environmentally conscious, they take it to Whole Foods for organic baby formula. Whole Foods is one of these progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they’re on loan from Amnesty International.

Actually, my favorite section is the snack food section. They couldn’t just have pretzels or potato chips — that would be vulgar. So they have these seaweed-based snacks like we get in my house, Veggie Booty With Kale. It’s for kids who come home from school and shout, “Mom, I want a snack that will help prevent colon-rectal cancer!”

Then as their children get older, the enlightened parents buy them Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream, the Ice Cream with its own environmental policy. I once suggested that Ben and Jerry’s should make a pacifist toothpaste. Doesn’t kill germs. Just asks them to leave.

Day by day the Ubermoms perfect their kids. By the time they apply for college they’ve started six companies, cured four formerly fatal diseases and did community service by doing environmental awareness training in Tibet. We’ve got a college president in Washington named Steve Trachtenberg, who says of his students’ community service: “I don’t know where these kids find lepers, but they find them and they read to them.”

So now all that work has paid off. You’re at commencement. This ceremony marks a turning point. It’s a moment of great accomplishment, but also of great uncertainty.

All your life adults have been giving you hoops to jump through, and from here on out you have to make your own hoops. Up until now there have been a few channels to succeed in. From now on there are an infinity of ways to succeed. I know someone whose daughter is a Las Vegas Casino Fountain Choreographer. Believe me, she didn’t go through college thinking she’d design fountain light shows. In 10 years, many of you will have jobs you’re not even aware of today.

From here on out the skills you need to succeed will change. The average collegiate GPA for a self-made millionaire is 2.7. You know all those morons who sat in the back of the classrooms goofing off? In a few years you’re going to have a new name for them: Boss.

In short, things are about to change big time. And one of my messages today is that you know that uncertainty you feel today? It never goes away. The question is, do you know how to make uncertainty your friend?

Now, commencement is a ceremony when the university gets a rich and successful person to tell you that being rich and successful is not that important.

Well I’ve got bad news for you. I’m not that rich and I’m not that successful. But I have been around successful people. You see I’m a journalist. If you go to a stadium and you see the crowd doing the wave, there are some people who just sit there watching. Those people are journalists. We lead boring lives while hanging around people who lead interesting lives.

And I’ve observed a few things about the few really great people I’ve had a chance to meet and cover. First, they tend to have really big heads. As someone once said, what they have doesn’t look like a head. It looks like a container for a head. They also can’t sit still. They need to be around people. You and I require sleep. They require people.

But here’s one other thing I’ve noticed that separates the really great people from the merely famous ones. They talk to dead people.

Merely famous people have pictures of themselves on the wall. Really great people have pictures of dead people on the wall, and on their desks. It’s one of the first things I look for when I go into somebody’s office.

And they talk about these dead people. John McCain, who was here a few years ago, talks a lot about Mo Udall, a Democratic politician he loved being around. He wrote a book called “Faith of My Fathers” about his father and his father’s father and so on. Barack Obama wrote a book called “Dreams From My Father” about his own father.

All his life, Abraham Lincoln talked with the founders of this country. Winston Churchill talked with the Duke of Marlborough. Theodore Roosevelt talked with the men and women who settled the West.

The dead were alive to them, and looking over their shoulder.

I recently ran across an example of this kind of conversation with the dead in a new book called “I am a Strange Loop” by an Indiana University scientist named Douglas Hofstadter.

Hofstadter was married to a woman named Carol. They loved washing the dishes together after dinner parties and reliving the conversation they’d just enjoyed. They had the same ways of raising their kids.

Then Carol died, when their kids were 5 and 2. A few weeks, later Hofstadter was looking at a picture of Carol. Here’s what he wrote:

“I looked at her face and looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying, as tears flowed, ‘That’s Me. That’s Me!’ And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before, about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity, about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children, about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes but were just one hope, one clear thing that defined us both, that wielded us into a unit, the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. I realized that though Carol had died, that core piece of her had not died at all, but that it had lived on very determinedly in my brain.”

The Greeks used to say we suffer our way to wisdom. Through his wife’s death, Hofstadter suffered his way to wisdom. In his day job as a scientist, he confirms that wisdom every day.

Hofstadter is part of a revolution in brain research, in genetics, in understanding who we are. The first thing this revolution confirms is that when he says Carol is alive in his brain, that’s not just a metaphor. That’s true.

The brain is more like quantum mechanics than a machine. It has many parallel swirls, a multitude of feedback loops, and it performs many simultaneous tasks. And you are the culmination of all the patterns implanted by your ancestors, parents and friends. You have a Wake Forest pattern in your brain that will influence you forever. It’s who you are.

The second thing we’ve learned is that we are not masters of what we think. At any moment the senses can absorb about 11 million pieces of information, but the mind can only be conscious of about forty. There is a vast automatic part of our brain we are not aware of, but which is learning from and responding to the people around us. This backstage part influences when we feel happy or fearful. It shoves up memories and thoughts. It selects information to pay attention to and helps us make sense of the chaos all around.

The third thing we’ve learned is that all these swirls and lightshows, all of this backstage process…it is all activated by emotion. Some philosophers separated reason from the passions, but that’s wrong. Without emotion the brain cannot make a decision. We are the product of the people and things we love.

And so the fourth thing we’ve learned, which is the culmination of all the other things, is that it’s not right to say that success is something we achieve individually. Success is not something that we do or that happens to us. Success is something that happens through us.

We inherit, starting even before we are born, a great river of knowledge, a great flow from many ages and many sources. The information that comes from millions of years ago, we call brain chemistry. The information that comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago from our hunter and gatherer ancestors we call genes. The information that was handed down thousands of years ago we call religion. The information passed along hundreds of years ago we call culture. The information passed along from decades ago we call family. The information you absorbed over the past few years at Wake Forest we call education.

But it is all information, and it flows from the deep past through us into the future. It flows from the dead through us to the living and the unborn. We exist as creatures within this hidden river of knowledge the way a trout exists in a stream or a river. We are formed by the river. It is the medium in which we live and the guide about how to live.

The great people I’ve seen talking to the dead do so because they want to connect with the highest and most inspiring parts of the river. When people make mistakes, often it is not because they are evil. It’s because they don’t have an ideal to live up to.

These great people also talk to the dead because they want a voice from outside their selves. Much of our culture culminates in the self. It’s all about making you happy. Making you rich. It treats you as the end of a long process.

But the best people I’ve met don’t feel that smart or that special. They have powerful jobs, but they don’t feel powerful. They don’t feel like architects building these great projects from scratch. They feel instead like river boat captains negotiating the currents around them.

They want to step outside their egotism and understand the river of events. They want to feel how people in the past have negotiated its channels. They want other voices in their heads so they can possess the ultimate power, which is the power of facing unpleasant truths.

Finally, I think they talk to the dead because they want to widen their time horizons. We’re living in a technological age that turns everything ephemeral. Newspapers become blogs. Letters become text messages. Everything becomes a more temporary version of itself.

But this other scientific revolution, this brain research revolution, lengthens our time horizons. It underlines how much we owe to the Ice Age hunters and gatherers ages and ages ago. It underlines that we are part of this long process.

People who talk to the dead want to feel connection to this procession through the ages. They need to feel in their bones where they have come from, and what ultimately they will leave behind.

Over the years, we all pick up good advice. Spend a year abroad. It’s bound to change your life. Think hard about who you marry. It’s the most important decision you will ever make. Devote yourself to your kids. Nothing else is guaranteed to make you happy. The only thing I’d add is, create a posse of dead people. Create an entourage of heroes. Put their pictures on your wall, and keep them in your mind.

They will remind you of your place in the hidden river of wisdom. They’ll serve as models. They’ll give you an honest perspective on how you’re doing. They’ll remind you that your blessings don’t come from you but from those who came before you.

Now as I wrap up I feel a little guilty because I haven’t gone on about how wonderful you are. And I’m sure you are wonderful. But I’m even more sure that you’re blessed. You’ve won the lottery of life. You’ve got great friends in a great institution in a great country. If you use you’re winnings wisely you’re going to have some delirious decades ahead of you. And maybe you’ll come back here in 60 years and watch your own grandkids graduate on this spot. And I bet you’ll find that day is even more beautiful than this one is.

Good luck, Class of 2007.

Thank you, Chancellor. And thank you for placing me after one of the best and wittiest student speeches I've ever heard. That's a cruel act.

But around the country now--all over this country--in colleges and universities and high schools and middle schools and elementary schools, even kindergartens--they graduate kindergarteners nowadays, with little hats and everything-there are commencement speakers who are saying to the students, "go forth." Have you ever heard a more useless invocation in your life? As if you were going to hang around here for the rest of your lives.

Of course you're going to go forth-that's what it's all about. You have your degree--baccalaureate, masters, Ph.D or whatever it is--and you have big plans. First of all, you have to have lunch. I hope you have it with the family. Some of you are embroiled in romance. Romances that are blooming, romances that are collapsing and, of course, that has to be taken care of too. Love prevails at times like this, and sometimes you're torn between your family and the loved one. Well, go with the family. The romance will pass, I assure you.

So, as the speakers exhort you, go forth. Well, maybe you're purposeful. I never had that sense of purpose myself. As a young man, I was kind of a wanderer; I went from one thing to another, one job to another. I suppose I engaged in that particular American activity called "finding myself." You'll probably find yourself if you have good luck. It's all over then. You don't have to do anything else if you've found yourself. So I think I've spent my life finding myself.

If I know anything, I learned it in the high school classrooms of New York City, where over the course of 30 years, I had approximately 12,000 students--boys, girls, what other sexes exist in New York City, indeterminate. Whatever I know, I've learned from them, because I think I was ignorant. Not illiterate, but ignorant. I'd never been to high school myself. And that's the best way to become a high school teacher--to know nothing.

I think my students understood that I knew nothing. And they helped me, they took pity on me. Especially the girls. The girls thought I was cute at that time. I had black hair, and I had this fumbling, awkward look about me, and they would help. They'd take the attendance, they'd distribute books, get book receipts and so on. The girls took beauty culture. And then they'd say, "Oh, Mr. McCourt, you have such nice hair, but it is a mess. Why don't you come up to beauty culture and we'll do you." Well, I declined that invitation. That was a dangerous invitation.

So I was learning in the classroom. I was learning to get rid of maybe the pomposity that I had developed as a college student at New York University. There were professors of education who really didn't know much about teaching in high schools. A lot of them, if they saw a teenager, they'd run a mile. But they told us all about how to perform in high school classrooms. And I had to learn--this is the point of this whole thing--I had to learn something about myself. I had to take off the teacher mask, which so many of us put on at the beginning; the mask that says: "Well, I'm the teacher and I know it all. You sit there and I'll tell you."

Well, I realized that I knew nothing, and that I was about to learn something, not just about the subject of English, whatever that is. For me, it spilled over into everything--my dreams, my nightmares, daytime, encountering the kids in the hallway. Because, as the Chancellor read a passage from this last book of mine, "Teacher Man," I was everything--a high school teacher, elementary school teacher, everything. It's not like being a college professor. A college professor walks in and stands up there and delivers himself or herself of scholarship and history and English and grammar.

In high school classrooms, there's a lot more going on. There's always something going on. They're always up to something. A lot of it is going on under the desks. They're passing notes back and forth. They're passing lunch back and forth. They're passing all kinds of illegal substances back and forth. And in the beginning, you don't know anything about this, but you're learning and suddenly you see kids who are getting that glazed look in their eyes.

Then there are kids who want a pass. This is something that's not dealt with at schools of education: how to deal with the bathroom pass. Because you know, when you're teaching, if the lesson is successful, they sit there and they look at you. You develop these senses after a while. You know if the lesson is successful. If they start raising their hands and asking for the pass, then you're doomed. Or if they start looking out the window, or if they start dozing off, or if they start scratching graffiti on the desk. New York City classrooms are full of graffiti that goes back ages and ages.

So here I'm learning all the time. After about 15 years in a high school classroom, I was beginning to feel comfortable-beginning to feel comfortable. They don't let you feel comfortable, they don't let you get smug, they don't let you rest on your laurels. You have to hold their attention. There's nothing like it in the world. Some of you may be thinking of becoming high school teachers. Well, more power to you. Do it, because you'll never relax again in your life. But you'll always have stories.

Some of you are going to be very successful; some of you are going to be hedge fund managers. I say that, and I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about. Hedge fund managers, or you're going to be accountants and so on and at the end of the day you're going to go home and your maid or your spouse or whoever will say, "How was your day, honey?" And if you're a hedge fund manager, you'll say "oh, another million," and you'll have nothing to say after that. But if you're a high school teacher--any kind of teacher--you have stories to tell. And then, if you have any kind of facility for language...

What did I say? Oh, there must be future teachers over here. My people. I'll see you later on.

If you're going to teach, you'll always have stories. So this was my career, and all the time, while I was teaching, something was happening, something very subtle. Remember, high school kids have been in school for 10, 11 or 12 years, and they're masters of teacher psychology. They've seen teachers come, they've seen teachers go. Sometimes they're responsible for the teachers going, because when you walk into a classroom, they size you up. They do it instinctively. They do it individually, and as a class, organically. And then they decide whether to let you live or die. I've seen teachers collapse in front of their classes and they had to be carried away and they were given disability pensions, which used to irritate me, because I was yearning for a disability pension. I tried to weep in front of some of these classes, but the kids just laughed and didn't report me to the principal.

So the years passed by and these kids--being master psychologists--would say to me, "So, like, Mr. McCourt"--this is the way they talked--"like, where did you grow up?"

"Ireland."

"Yeah, so like ..." They're trying to get me away from the lesson. Sometimes I planned to teach grammar. Sometimes I was going to devote 45 minutes to the dangling participle, and they sensed this, and they weren't having it. So, "Mr. McCourt, where did you grow up?"

"Ireland."

"So what's it like in Ireland?"

"Wet." 

"So, like, Mr. McCourt..." I used to get so exasperated because they were so good at it--it was a big contest between them and me. "So, Mr. McCourt, are there mostly Catholics in Ireland?" 

"Yeah, we're mostly Catholic."

"So, Mr. McCourt, in Ireland, did you go out with girls?"

"No, sheep. We went out with sheep. What do you think we went out with?"

So this is what you have to deal with. You'd like to think of yourself like a university professor where you go in and you discourse most eloquently, but it wasn't like that at all. And I realized, as the years passed, they kept asking me these questions about my life, and later on they'd say, "You know, Mr. McCourt, you should write a book." So, I do what I'm told. When I retired, I wrote a book. But it was because of standing in front of those classes, year after year after year. Remember, it wasn't like being a university professor. We had five classes a day - not like five classes every two months like the college professors. Five classes a day, 25 classes a week. I don't want to discourage any of you who are thinking of becoming teachers from going into teaching, because it's a huge adventure. I can assure you, you won't be investing much in hedge funds or anything like that. You'll be counting your pennies, you'll worry about having children, and then you'll have to think of sending your children to college and so on. You'll always be pinching pennies. But that's part of the life.

So, you're going forth, and I'm sure most of you will be comfortable. Most of you have these degrees under your belt now. Most of you will be going through the American way of life. You'll engage in that dangerous thing called "security." The next thing is smugness. The next thing is Weight Watchers. And you worry about this. I think at the end of my teaching career, I began to ask myself, "What am I doing in the classroom? How am I trying to affect them?" And I developed an equation for myself; I put it on the board. I write "F" with an arrow pointed to the next day--from "fear" to "freedom." That's it. To free yourself of the stuff that's been imposed on you. I'm not talking about education. I'm not talking about open discourse, but all the dogma that's forced on most of us. I grew up with dogma, and had to spend the rest of my life shedding it. So I think I'm shed of it now. Now I think I can sleep. Now I'm nothing, nothing. My mind is an open book, if it's open at all.

So I've reached this point in my life where I'm doing what I want to do and that's the most beautiful thing of all. Last year in San Francisco a young woman told me she was about to become a teacher, and did I have any advice for her. The only thing I could think of at that moment--I think I knew it all along--was to find what you love, and do it. If you don't love what you're doing, you're dead. Take out insurance. You're dead. And I leave you with a quotation from an old English poem: "Read your scriptures, follow in the path of virtue, and keep your bowels open."

Thank you.

On behalf of the Class of 2007 I would like to welcome our families, friends, the honorees, faculty, staff and administration to the 150th Commencement Ceremony of Niagara University.  This year has been blessed with many joyous events surrounding the university’s anniversary and as the graduating class we have been so fortunate to have this opportunity of sharing in the celebration.

I would first like to start off by thanking a group of amazing students that really brought our class together over these four special years of our lives. To the Senior Student Government members Kelly Thomson, Nicole Buccheit, Elaine Zamojski, Molly Shanahan, Karen Young, Jackie Cavanaugh, Jessica Spyra, Dave Awald, Eric Clingersmith, Maureen Buoneto, Parker Jones, Roseanne DiFlorio and Ryan McCorduck without your gifts and talents our class would not have had the social experience and memories they have made over the last four years.  Your endless hard work and dedication to your class will not soon be forgotten.  A special thank you goes out to our president Fr. Joseph Levesque, the executive vice president and the vice president of academic affairs Dr. Bonnie Rose, Brother Martin Schneider, Rhonda Shiah, Mati Ortiz, Bill Newton, Ellen Batrouny and Christine Schwartz.  These “behind the scenes” people have made our years at Niagara a huge success, been there as a support system and helped put together this momentous occasion.

On behalf of our entire class, I would like to extend a big thank you to our families and friends who have supported us up to this point on our journey in life.  Without your guidance, support and financial help we would not be standing here today.  Your sacrifices whether big or small have helped us succeed and grow as individuals.  As, hard as it was for you to let us grow up, it goes without saying that your unending love and compassion for us has helped make us who we are and will not soon be forgotten.

Today we are seated with diplomas in hand, graduates of four different colleges that make one awesome university.  When we entered Niagara as freshman who would have thought four years could go by so quickly and in those four years we could become the people we are today.  Four years ago we gathered in the Gallagher gym to open a new chapter in our lives.  The Convocation that took place that day could not have prepared us for what was really in store for our four college years at Niagara.  As we made a transition then, so we do today.  We are no longer high school seniors entering college.  Now, we are mature individuals entering the real world; a world known to many to be challenging in many aspects.  As some of us enter the job market, our country’s armed forces, and others graduate and professional programs, we take with us not only a world class education, but the necessary attributes and Vincentian values that will help us succeed.  I think Sister Nora Gatto described what the students at Niagara shared best in a speech a few weeks back at the Sigma Alpha Sigma Honor Society Inductions.  She said people at this university all have one thing in common, a Vincentian heart.  You know you have a Vincentian heart when:
•	You see a person, not a case study in poverty
•	You see a promise, not just another problem
•	Your see step one and maybe even step two of a solution, not just an impossible situation
•	You see opportunity where others see obstacles
•	You see hope where others feel despair
•	You see light where others see only the darkness and shadows
•	You see justice where others see just one more thing to do
•	You see a path where others see a dead end
•	You see the face of God in the eyes of the person who is before you, no matter who they are.
So as Sister Nora said at the induction ceremony, so I say to you Listen, Trust, Follow, reflect and Share your Vincentian Heart.  In conclusion we must thank different people for our many gifts.
•	You’re smart.  Thank God for that
•	You’re a passionate learner.  Thank all who have ever taught you for that
•	You’ve worked hard.  Thank yourself for that
•	You’re generous and well-rounded.  Thank your families for that, especially your siblings if you have them
•	You’re needed.  Thank those who need you the most for that.
•	Your life has meaning.  So Live by your Vincentian Heart.
  While our school is small in size; it is not small in heart or the common values we share with one another.  Niagara University is not just a school we attend, it is a home away from home where we all have come together and been a family.  Our four years here have brought us more knowledge to succeed in life and have taught us that no obstacle is too big to overcome with a little hard work.  All of us have brought something unique to our class and enabled many people to share in our success and great memories.

Through the years many events have brought us closer together as a class.  Whether you were involved in organizations or not, I hope that you can say you lived out your college experience to the fullest and the memories or the laughter and tears we have all shared will not soon be forgotten.

As an education major, I feel it is necessary for me to recite a few lines from one of my favorite author;  I give you these words from a Dr. Seuss book “Oh The Places You’ll Go” and hope that you can take these with you as you move on to future endeavors that you will encounter in life.
	You have brains in your head.
	You have feet in your shoes.
	You can steer yourself in any direction you choose.  
	You’re on your own. 
	And you know what you know.
	You are the guy who’ll decide where to go and what to do.
 So in closing one chapter of our lives, many new beginnings and chapters will open.  Niagara has paved the way to a bright future for each and every one of us.  We have been blessed to experience an educational opportunity as well as the teachings of a greater sense of good will, morals, character and leadership skills.  This university community where education really did make a difference in each of our lives was merely a stepping stone to greater things.  But always remember all you have learned and experienced at Niagara and use that to better yourself and other people around you.  My final message to you the graduates of the class of 2007 can be summed up in a poem by Amanda Bradley called ‘Don’t Forget.”
Forget about the days
when it’s been cloudy,
but don’t forget your
hours in the sun. 
Forget about the times
you’ve been defeated, 
but don’t forget 
the victories you’ve won.
Forget about mistakes 
that you can’t change now,
but don’t forget the lessons
that you’ve learned.
Forget about misfortunes
you’ve encountered, 
but don’t forget the times 
your luck has turned. 
Forget about the days 
when you’ve been lonely, 
but don’t forget the friendly 
smiles you’ve seen. 
Forget about plans 
that didn’t seem 
to work out right,
but don’t forget to always
have a dream.

So I say to you today, graduation is a time for us to celebrate all of our achievements, but don’t stop there.  Once this is all said and done and the party hats are put away, it will be up to you to move past the greatness that we have achieved and continue living life to the fullest.  So Class of 2007 We have the knowledge to go forth and succeed.   Don’t Forget to Dream Big, Go Far, and Never Stop Learning.  Thank You and God Bless!


President Lebron, distinguished faculty, parents, family and guests and most of all class of 2007,I’m honored to be with you on this wonderful occasion. President Lebron was very kind in his introduction. I asked him what I should talk about today. He said “About 10 minutes.” but when I met with some of you graduates you said “John, talk to us about life and love.” So I’m going to tell you four love stories, three about me and the fourth about you, just four stories.

The first story is about a love that all of us can identify with, love for parents. You can probably remember when you were young how you looked up to your parents as your heroes. For me that feeling has never gone away. My parents raised five kids in Saint Louis on a middle class income. They always made us feel we came first. They worked hard and saved the money to send all of us through college and I remember how proud they were of the day I got an acceptance letter from Rice. In the nearly 40 years since they’ve always been here for me and my siblings. They’ve loved each of us unconditionally and made sure we knew it. They’ve always been proud of whatever we do and I try to share the important events in my life with them so naturally they are here today. I’d like to introduce them to you.

34 years ago they were here not far from where they are now. My mom and I chat every week to share what’s happening. She’s always there and 100 percent empathetic and listening. My siblings and I make a concerted effort to plan a holidays so we can be together and every year for as far back as I can remember we’ve had our last family vacation with all of us kids, our spouses and grandkids.

Graduates, in the years ahead your lives are going to get pretty hectic at times. There will always be another business trip to take, another phone call to make and another dinner to attend. Like today your accomplishments will continue to make them proud but remember particularly this, Mother’s Day weekend, nothing will make Mom happier than picking up the phone and calling once a week.

The most important lesson I learned from my parents is that family comes first. The second love story begins when I was an undergraduate here. In the president’s introduction he only briefly mentioned my most important accomplishment, one that dwarfs all of the others. It occurred right here at Rice. I met my one true love but it almost didn’t happen.

Three years into Rice I was a scrawny, nerdy electrical engineer and I had one thing in common with most of my classmates. I couldn’t get it date. That’s when Ken Kennedy stepped in. Ken is the one person I wish was with us here today. My teacher and friend spent nearly four decades at Rice asa beloved professor before he passed away in February. Forgive me, but cancer sucks.

At the beginning of my junior year, knowing that I was shy around girls, Ken pushed me to meet another engineering student named Ann. For months I wrote Ann’s name over and over again and her number on the side of my legal pad but I couldn’t find the courage to call her.Honestly, I felt unlovable and I feared she’d turn me down but Friday night February 2 was unlike any other Friday night. YesI was alone in the basement of the Memorial Center just outside KTRY watching Star Trek and probably feeling a bit sorry for myself. All of a sudden, in walked Ann and she was sparkling, vivacious, sensitive and very smart. She was looking for me.

What I didn’t know is that Ken had worked some magic to get us together. He had encouraged Ann to ask me to help her fix the broken public address system at Jones College. I may have been shy but I wasn’t stupid. So Ann and I walked from the RNC through this quadrangle to Jones, to check out that public address system and I quickly concluded that it was broken, very broken and it was going to take a long time to fix it.

That same night Ann and I walked from Jones College to a play rehearsal at Hammond Hall and then went into an off-campus party, then hand in hand around the stadium. We watched the sunrise. We became a couple. For many Friday nights following we fine dined on burgers from the Jack-in-the-Box. Countless times Ann helped me find my car, patiently searching the campus because I forgot where I parked it. I helped her buy her first car which we named Woodstock. It was a yellow VW beetle whose reverse gear didn’t work but best of all we frequently walked around and around the Rice Stadium for hours, lost in each other continuing our first date

FortunatelyAnn saw in me something only she could show me, that I was lovable and loved. She’s settled that question for me forever. So what really mattered for me at Rice wasn’t starting KTRU or my master’s degree in engineering or the great job opportunities or even, faculty, the outstanding teaching. What really mattered is what moved me beyond myself so I was able love others.

In two weeks we will celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary and someday, Mom and Dad, we hope to celebrate our 58th wedding anniversary like you will in September. This leads to the third love story about kids. With Ann by my side,I took on a truly big responsibility, having children.It took me and Ann about a decade of trying before we had Mary and Esther.

Now parents, what is it that you wish for your kids? For my mom and dad I’ve learned to be sure that your kids know first and foremost that they are loved unconditionally and second that they have the confidence to believe they can do anything so at least they will try. Finally, that they are well socialized they can figure out who they are and how to love others.

As my kids in their adolescence struggled to find their place Ken Kennedy again comes to mind. Ken’s wife, Carol says he urged their daughter Caitlin to be who she is not who others want her to be. Ken said “Caitlin, let yourself become the extraordinary person, who you are.” There’s no greater gift a parent can give a child.

WhatI’ve come to realize as a parent is something my mom and dad live fully. You make meaning in life through others. It’s a simple powerful message but it’s not so easy to live. I’ve been blessed with a strong upbringing and terrific family but it’s easy to lose track of one’s priorities.

About ten years ago I was not living life family first. I traveled too much. Anything last minute at work took priority over family. OnceI started missing a few meals at home it became easier to miss more. One day I suddenly realized that Esther was walking. Mary was in kindergarten and I was not as involved in their lives as I wanted to be. Then Ann developed cancer. Everything changed. I changed.I began living so that family is the highest priority. I wanted to be and I needed much more time with Ann, with Mary and Esther, to be present with them the way my parents were there for me.

Being home in the evenings has become one of my top priorities and not just being home but being present. So much so that we’ve declared 6:00 to 10:00PM as in the email free family time zone. With Ann’s cancer in remission we live each day for the blessing that it is. I also travel less, a lot less, than five days a month and sometimes that means craziness like flying to China for only 18 hours in order to get back home after just one night in Beijing. Sometimes that means not getting everythingI want done at work. Business meetings, dinners and travel must now pass the test, is this really worth missing tonight at home? Since applying this test, I’ve been getting home for dinner almost every night.

Ken Kennedy taught me not to be afraid to fail but there is one place you should not fail. That’s with your family and your children. WhenI screw up as a venture capitalist I may lose some money and a bit of pride but if I fail as a parent I’d lose love and lives that can never be regained.

The fourth and last love story is yours. It’s all about you and your loved ones, only it’s unfinished. You are writing it from this moment onwards, right here, right now. Don’t wait 34 years to ask the important questions. Start today. What will all this book learning from Rice make of your life? Who are your role models, your mentors, your heroes? Most important, who is your true love and what kind of parent are you? Who do you want to be?How will you make meaning of life?

It’s easy to get lost in ambition and accomplishment but that path in itself may not make a meaningful life. Apply what you know and what you’ve learned to your own passion and aim high. Ignore the pundits, including me. Accept advice and learn from others but make it your own and never forget that meaning comes from what you do with and for others, meaning from the ones you love and from those who love you and all the others yet to be discovered.

Four simple love stories about our parents keeping family first, about true love that allows you to love others, about kids and unconditional love for who they are, and about you making your own meaning.I’m always going to remember what my dad once told me he said, “John, Mom and I are going to give you one gift which no one can ever take away, a good education but it’s up to you to decide what to do with it.”

A lot of people have worked awfully hard to help give you the education of a lifetime. Now it’s up to you to decide what to do with it. That’s enough questions and advice. For the rest of today celebrate your success.Enjoy your family, your friends and your loved ones.

Be proud to call yourself a Rice graduate. So class of 2007, here’s your very last assignment. Please join me now, stand up please, turn and applaud your parents and loved ones. Congratulations class of 2007.

You’ve earned it.

Simple Lessons for a Complicated Time.

They may be clichés. But as my husband, Jay, used to say, clichés become clichés because they usually contain some essential truth.

Number one, I highly recommend you all become members of the two H club: hard work and humility. I read a book last year called “Generation Me” ... with the following subtitle: “Why today’s young Americans are more confident, assertive, entitled, and miserable than ever before.”

The premise of the book is that this generation — those born in the seventies, eighties and nineties — have been raised by parents who taught them that they were special from birth ... and not based on accomplishment or achievement. In other words, self-esteem without portfolio ... and that they could be anything they wanted to be.

But against the backdrop of the complicated, competitive world I just described, their high self-regard, high expectations, and sense of entitlement have set them up for frustration, anxiety, and disappointment.

As one social scientist put it, “This is a time of soaring expectations and crushing realities.” Ouch!

I guess my first piece of advice better be: “Defy labels.” But there is something instructive here. There is no substitute for hard work, for doing well at the job you’re in.

When I made coffee and Xeroxed and distributed newspapers at ABC News, I thought my life was over.But I did it; I didn’t complain. And along the way, I learned a lot, and was ready for the bigger jobs that were around the corner.

So no matter how much potential you think you have, a little humility will serve you well — and help you focus on doing your best in the job you’ve got, rather than plotting to get the job you think you deserve.

Number two: Be passionate. Do what you love, even if you don’t love it every day. I knew I had to be a journalist because I’m deeply curious about the world, I love to write, and I saw that when properly practiced, it’s a craft that can help galvanize an often complacent citizenry, and make a difference.

You’ll also be good at what gets you going. According to a survey of 75 business leaders with Stanford MBAs, the most important predictor of success is self-awareness.

That means knowing — and accepting — your own strengths and weaknesses. In other words: Look at yourself honestly ... understand your passions, your skills, your temperament, and your limitations. If you’re a square peg, no matter how hard you — and others — try, you’re just not going to fit very well into a round hole.

I’ve interviewed hundreds of extremely successful people, and among those who are rich and famous, the vast majority made money and became prominent not because they pursued riches and fame, but only as a side effect of doing what they love.

In fact, the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert has spent decades studying happiness and he found that cash and contentment are almost completely disconnected. Sure, having money gives you one less thing to worry about, but don’t look to it as a magic bullet.

Dr. Gilbert says that once your basic needs are met, the old adage really is true: Money can’t buy you happiness.

Winning the lottery won’t even give you a more positive outlook. According to Dr. Gilbert, six months after they hit the jackpot, lottery winners are only about as happy as they were before.

Happiness has much more to do with your basic constitution, your outlook on life, and loving what you do.

If you choose a career that makes you say “My job, Mylanta,” the best remedy is finding that fire in your belly — without all the heartburn.

But to land that dream job, you’ll need something else. Which brings me to lesson number three: Persistence.

When I was trying to get my first job out of college, I had my sights set on landing that entry-level position at ABC News in Washington. After weeks of calling and getting nowhere, I asked my mom to drive me to the bureau in our family’s cream-colored station wagon and wait for me in the car.

I walked in the building and asked the physically imposing security guard if I could speak to the bureau chief. He asked if I had an appointment and when I said, “Not exactly,” he had a pretty good laugh.

Then I asked to use the phone in the waiting area, dialed the operator, and asked for David Newman, the executive producer of World News Tonight. Luckily, he picked up his own phone.

“Hi Davy,” I said, “You don’t know me, but your twin brothers Steve and Eddie went to high school with my sister Kiki, and I live down the street from your cousin Julie.”

He listened patiently as i rambled on. After convincing him that we went way back, I asked him if I could come up and poke my head in the bureau chief’s office. I think he was so befuddled that he said, “Sure.” I introduced myself to the bureau chief, who seemed impressed by my moxie and resourcefulness. I watched as he found my resumé and moved it to the top of the pile — and i was hired two months later.

But let me just add: There is a fine line between persistence and being straight out annoying. Working someone’s nerves too much won’t get you very far.

I know of countless examples, though, of persistence paying off both in getting the job you want and getting your goals accomplished.

Persistence is critical. Being creative and persistent is even better.

The fourth lesson that has served me well, that I know you will have to call upon at some point in your lives, is resilience. As John Lennon wrote, “Life is what happens when you’re making other plans.” You will inevitably face disappointment, loss, and struggles that are, at this moment, inconceivable and impossible to predict.

I never could have imagined, in a million years, what happened to me. It was April 1997, spring was in the air, Ellen was coming out of the closet, and my healthy, handsome, hard-working husband, Jay Monahan, was doubled over in pain.

We went to the doctor and in a span of six hours our lives changed forever. Jay was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. Our daughter Ellie was five, and Carrie had just turned one.

Through the next nine months, as I witnessed Jay’s hellish journey through chemo, radiation, and the ravages of cancer I was both inspired and in awe. His strength, his humor, and his uncommon grace will stay with me forever.

On such a happy occasion, this story may be a real “buzz kill,” but I want you to be prepared to reach down deep and find the inner fortitude you need after disappointments big and small, and the painful losses that are an inevitable part of life.

The subject of disappointment brings me to my fifth point: Be fearless. Have the courage to take risks. Go where there are no guarantees. Get out of your comfort zone, even if it means being uncomfortable.

The road less traveled is sometimes fraught with barricades, bumps, and uncharted terrain. But it is on that road where your character is truly tested — and your personal growth realized.

There will be times when many of you will be tempted to play it safe. I could have stayed at The Today Show for the rest of my career, but decided to take a leap of faith and accept the challenge of being the first solo woman anchor on an evening news broadcast. I have no regrets.

At times, it hasn’t been easy. Unrealistically high expectations, unprecedented scrutiny, and what sometimes feels like a greek chorus of naysayers rooting for me to fail — all of that has definitely tested my mettle.

But I have never felt stronger or more confident. And I know that I would have regretted not taking this chance of a lifetime. I hope that, when you feel it in your heart, you will also take a leap of faith and go for it.

You may have heard this before, but Theodore Roosevelt once wrote something that bears repeating: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better, the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.”

Courage will be required of you on many fronts. Have the courage to seek the truth, and speak the truth, to stand up for the under-dog, and to stand up against intolerance — even if yours is the lone voice doing so. Have the courage to trust your gut and your own moral compass — your innate understanding of right and wrong. Have the courage to love fearlessly and unconditionally, and don’t compromise that love because of arrogance or insecurity. And have the courage to accept that you’re not perfect, nothing is, and no one is — and that’s OK.

My sixth point is often the one that takes the longest to learn, although your generation seems to have gotten a head start. Service is better than selfishness, and usually a lot more rewarding. Dr. Gilbert, the Harvard happiness expert, has studies that prove that generous people are also happier people. And while I’m far from perfect, i know that whenever I’ve made the choice to help others — whether it’s raising money for cancer research, or helping an old lady across the street — I’ve never regretted it.

Elie Weisel once said, “The opposite of love isn’t hate, the opposite of love is indifference.” Hold on to the wonderful idealism you have about the world, and your ability to change it, for as long as you can, and if possible, for your entire lives. Tune out the cynics who tell you that you can’t.

And finally, if all of these points fail, I highly recommend a couple of shots of Patrone with a Red Bull chaser — I hear it can really get you going! Just kidding! Now the two most highly anticipated words in any graduation address: In closing ...

My seventh and final lesson is: Find the joy. Life goes by in an instant. In this fast-paced, crazy world, slow down enough to appreciate and revel in the many things you will experience — a baby’s smile, the beautiful symmetry of a cherry blossom, the embrace of a comforted friend, the spectacular palate of a desert sunset.

In her “Short Guide to a Happy Life,” Anna Quindlen wrote: “Life is made up of moments, small pieces of glittering mica in a long stretch of gray cement. It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as busy as the ones most of us lead now, that won’t happen. We have to teach ourselves how to make room for them, to love them and to live, really live.”

And in a world that seems increasingly snarky and judgmental, be kind. Be kind to your friends, be kind to your family, be kind to yourselves. And remember, just as you are, everyone really is just doing the best they can.

And while you’re creating your definition of success, let me leave you with Ralph Waldo Emerson’s. He said success is:

“To laugh often and much;
To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
To appreciate beauty;
To find the best in others;
To leave the world a little better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;
To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.”

Thank you, Dean Harris, for that kind and incredibly generous introduction. Chairs Reimer and Marletta, distinguished faculty, and most importantly, members of the graduating Class of 2007: Give yourself a hand. I would also like to acknowledge proud, relieved and debt-ridden parents, and family members, friends and anyone who helped pay the bills or cheered you on!

OK, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking 'Hey, Dean!... What the heck is going on here? The community college across the bay gets Steve Jobs for their commencement speaker and we get this guy — who doesn't even have a job.'

But, take heart - at least I know the three rules of graduation speeches:

Be sincere!
Be humble!
And, be seated! The sooner the better.
And with these three rules in mind. I'll keep my remarks brief.

But also bear in mind that my talk will be the last impediment between you and the first phone call from the Alumni Office soliciting you for donations!

A year ago, when I received the invitation from Dean Harris to speak here today, little did he know that I was in a London hospital on the verge of a nervous break down...If he had had that little nugget of information, I doubt that I would be here now!

My meltdown was due to a perfect storm of events including continual and severe vision loss, the suicide of my brother, unresolved issues with my father who passed away prematurely due to a brain tumor and an unbridled ambition that could never be satiated. My meltdown gave me a lot of time to think about the important things in my life and what I wish I had known when I sat where you're sitting today. I am fully cognizant that it is impossible to stick an old head on a young body but I've tried to distill five lessons I've learned:

Lesson One: BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE
What do I mean by that? Although your life may be cruising along smoothly, I recommend that every once in a while you stop and envision a sudden shipwreck occurring. Then think, re-think and remember what you would really want to hold on to if disaster should strike.

I can guarantee that you will NOT be thinking about whether you got tenure; you made partner; or about all the things you acquired such as the latest Apple iPhone . . . . though I really want one and am on the waiting list.

You will, I am sure...be thinking of the true accomplishments in your life. The building of a rock-solid and loving family; investing yourself in something you are truly proud of and the establishing of long lasting and gratifying relationships.

Lesson Two: NEVER SEND OUT A CHRISTMAS CARD DESCRIBING ALL YOUR AILMENTS
You are all high achievers. And YES, it's true that delayed gratification is a key factor in achieving future productivity and prosperity. But, delaying happiness along with gratification is quite another thing, because each milestone along your path ought to have its own form of happiness.

How many people have you heard say things like:

I will be happy when my first company goes public.
I will be happy when my kids get out of college.
or

I will really be happy when I win the Nobel Prize.
From what I've seen of life, I have found that Abraham Lincoln was right, when he said: "Most people are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be." Let me run that by you one more time, "Most people are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be."

So, as some famous Rabbi said — or maybe it was Geena Davis in "Commander in Chief" — "If not now, when?"

Lesson Three: REMEMBER THAT LIFE IS ABOUT TWO-LEGGED MAMMALS
My former business partner used to say to those who wanted to know how he made so much money: "I invest in 'TWO-LEGGED MAMMALS.'" In my career as a start-up entrepreneur, I have deliberately remained focused on the value of people even amidst our ever-rising worship of technology. I don't look for great ideas and cool technology; more importantly, I look first for people who have the courage and drive to develop great ideas.

I'm always dumbfounded by people who over-utilize in order to enhance communication and foster relationships. Technology such as:

email
instant messaging
Second Life
and, yes, the Face Book Wall
In my view, there just is no substitute for direct communication in order to get past the superficial and connect with the soul of another human. In fact, I've found that these high-tech communication tools can be counter-productive...I wish I had a dime for every miss-construed email I've sent or received. My wife used to ask me, "Larry, why don't you do more of your work over the phone and travel less?" And, my answer to that was an unequivocal, "I just can't!"

I just can't because it's not enough to read the resumes and business plans. Reports and analyses just can't communicate qualities such as passion, such as inspiration, such as imagination, and, especially, that overwhelming hunger to succeed.

The secret to success in start-ups, or any other collaboration, is to find and team up with people who will drive and drag you to success! And there's just no technological short cut for that.

Lesson Four: SUCCESS TAKES EQUAL PARTS OF CHUTZPAH AND HUMILITY
In your chemistry vocabulary, that's the required stoichiometry. Now, between you and me, I tend to hire people from Berkeley more often than those from Stanford, because I've found — over time — that Berkeley graduates generally have a good dose of both chutzpah and humility...while the Stanford graduates seem to specialize in chutzpah.

The secret is maintaining a balance between courage and confidence on one side, and retaining a sense of humbleness and modesty on the other side. With 20/20 hindsight -- I can clearly see that the lowest points in my life were when I became a victim of my own hubris. That is to say, I found that the biggest killer of a good mind is to stick it in a fat head!

As Aristotle noted in his Golden Law of Means, "Excellence and virtue lie between the extremes." For example:

Between cowardice and foolhardiness, lies bravery.
Between the reckless squandering of money and miserly penny-pinching lies wise spending.
and so: Between chutzpah and humility lies success.
So, if you ever lose your sense of humility and need to be re-grounded, here is a little trick that I've learned: listen in while your father-in-law or your kids describe what you do for a living. I can guarantee it won't sound like such hot stuff. Recently, my daughter accompanied me to a conference where I was introduced as a titan of the nanotechnology industry and she turned to me and said, "Yeah, Dad - you're a real NanoTitan."

Lesson Five: FAILURE IS MERELY A DRESS REHEARSAL FOR FUTURE SUCCESS
I have always thought it was unfortunate that the word failure is a noun — or as you chemists say, a state function. I prefer to think of failure as a catalyst for future success, or, as an unforeseen reaction with a lot of useful by-products.

Keep in mind that you are already in the top 0.1 percent to have gotten to where you are and as you move on from here, you will undoubtedly suffer some setbacks along the way. Unfortunately, history has taught us to see and cheer only the last experiment that succeeds and ignore the thousands that failed. We see only the final glory of each athletic victory and don't see the years it took to develop the strength, skill and stamina to achieve that victory. Even if you fail and fall many times, that's OK - just get up, dust yourself off and move on!

Kipling described perseverance brilliantly in his famous poem "IF." I was going to recite it for you, but decided, instead, to share a similar poem that I learned in kindergarten:

When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
When the road your climbing seems all up hill,
When funds are low and debts are high,
When you want to smile but you have to sigh,
When care is getting you down a bit,
Rest if you must - but don't you quit.
I have found that often the contest DOES go to the last person standing. And that when one door closes another one does open..Take me for example: I wanted more than anything else in the world to go to medical school, but despite numerous attempts I didn't get in. And I was devastated.

But, this forced me to take a slightly different direction in life. And, fortunately, God had his hand on my shoulder and I got a job as one of the early employees at a largely unknown company called Genentech. This led me down a new path, which allowed me to capitalize on my love of medicine and utilized my ability to match the best scientific ideas with the best talent and financial backing. And that has resulted in a life that has been even more exciting and even more rewarding than I ever anticipated.

And, what's more, several of the products that my start-up companies have developed have allowed me to make a contribution to the medical profession, probably more than I could have made had I been a doctor. For me — this turned out to be the best fit. In fact as it turns out, I can't even stomach watching "Grey's Anatomy".

In the final analysis, the strength of your character comes not from how you react to your successes, of which I know there will be many. The strength of your character comes from how you react to your failures, of which there also will be many, especially if you make bold moves. So, always believe in yourself, persevere, but be willing to adapt.

Well, I see that the diplomas are ready to be handed out and your friends and families are eager to shake your hands. I just want to close by saying...for the life of me, I cannot think of any better springboard from which to launch a lifetime of achievement, than with a degree in the chemical sciences from the University of California, Berkeley. When you look at your diplomas, they will have a lot of fancy lettered assertions on them, but what they really say is:

The person who earned this diploma is starting their career in the most complex, sophisticated and important discipline known to man.
And, the person who earned this diploma was selected and educated by the world's top university teaching that discipline.
Each of you has earned that kind of recognition. But, to paraphrase the Bible: "from whom much is given, much is expected." You have been given powerful tools with which to solve the world's greatest problems. We look to you to:

create abundant and renewable energy sources,
relieve global warming,
avert worldwide starvation,
and, to increase, not only the length of life, but the quality of life for every man, woman and child on this earth.
And, for that, you have my heartiest encouragement and congratulations.

Thank you. And God Speed.

My Dear Diana, thank you so much. Nothing could make me happier than to be here at home, honoring you, because you have been the remarkable star at Wellesley. It is an honor to have been asked by you. Distinguished faculty and trustees, parents, alums, friends and members of the class of 2007, I am also a yellow fellow. Although we didn't exactly call ourselves golden, I like it. I am very honored to be here with you on this long-awaited day.

To President Walsh, I want to add my voice to all those who have already extended congratulations for your remarkable service. During your tenure, Wellesley has stayed true to tradition while growing in every conceivable way, intellectually, and in the diversity and talent of its student body and in its financial health.

Today, Wellesley is not just a top college; it is the best college – an influence for good not only in America but around the world – and you have nurtured it, you, dear Diana, every step of the way – we are all very grateful to you.

To the parents who are here, let me just say that as the mother of three college graduates, I expect you are as amazed as I was – about how short the interval is between diapers and diplomas.

To Wellesley’s alumnae, and I am a very, very, proud one, this is a day rich in memory.

I can't help but recall my own college years – I lived up there in Severance. My time took place roughly half way between the invention of the handheld BlackBerry and the discovery of fire. The world then was a little bit different; the pace was not so fast.

I don’t know how many of you remember. In those days, our phones still had cords; our mail still had stamps; our cameras still had film, and when we wanted to find the web, we didn’t click on a mouse, we dusted in the corner.

I loved this college and this campus. In fact, I am tempted to tell the class of 2007 that you have just spent the best years of your lives – but my purpose is to celebrate with you – not to depress you – and besides, I am sure that your time here has prepared you for many wonderful years to come. So hearty congratulations. You did it. Today is the day you finally realize that all the hours of studying and worrying about grades were worth it.

Now there is only one thing that stands between you and President Walsh’s final charge to the senior class. And that's my speech.

The commencement speaker when I graduated was the current Secretary of Defense. He was a very fine man and a good orator. His daughter was actually graduating with us and I can't remember accurately all that he said but he did charge us to raise good sons. I do remember being extremely happy. Mr. Wilbur from our English Department had just written the lyrics to the musical "Candide." My favorite line was, and still is, “it's all for the best in this best of all possible worlds." That is how I hope you feel today.

Every year, you will meet new people, travel to different places, and have experiences that you never had before. Today – for all of us – is a moment for optimism, excitement and hope. And yet, even in our high spirits, we cannot help but be conscious of the shadows. For we know that, in every life, joy and sorrow are mixed and I would not be doing my job if I failed to remind you of that.

Around our country and around our world, we mourn the loss of innocent lives to hurricanes, tsunamis, disease and – as the horror at Virginia Tech reminds us – the demons that sometimes infect the human mind.

As we mark this day, we are concerned by the insecurity and injustice that result from the dark side of globalization, widening the gap between rich and poor, and endangering the environmental health of our planet. We are angered that religion is used by some as a license to murder, as if God’s commandment were “thou shalt kill.” And we worry about the grinding uncertainty of a complex and frustrating war in Iraq, and the world’s failure in Darfur to respond to genocide.

All of which is another way of saying: Class of 2007, you have a lot of work to do. You are the leaders of tomorrow, and it will be your job to pick up the baton so often mishandled by the leaders of today.

For inspiration, I can think of no more moving a story than that involving a passenger on United Flight 93, which went down in Pennsylvania on 9/11. That passenger, Tom Burnett, called his wife from the hijacked plane, having realized by then that two other planes had crashed into the World Trade Center.

“I know we’re going to die,” he said. “But some of us are going to do something about it.” And because they did, many other lives were saved. Since that awful morning, the memory of their heroism has uplifted us and it should also instruct us. Because when you think about it, “I know we’re going to die,” is a wholly unremarkable statement. Each of us here this morning could say the same thing. It is Burnett’s next words that were both matter of fact and electrifying: “Some of us are going to do something about it.”

Those words, it seems to me, convey the fundamental challenge put to us by life. We are all mortal. What divides us is the use we make of the time and opportunities we have.

Another way of thinking about the same question is to consider the recent discovery of similarities between the genetic code of a human being and that of a mouse. We are 95 percent the same. Perhaps each night, we should ask ourselves – what have we done to prove there is a difference? After all, mice eat and drink, groom themselves, chase each other’s tails and try to avoid risk. How does our idea of “have a nice day” differ from that?

It's possible that we are all so busy using time-saving devices that we don’t have time to do anything meaningful. Or we might have the right intentions, but instead of acting, we decide to wait – until we are out of school, until we can afford a down payment on a home, until we can finance college for our own children, or until we can free up time in retirement.

We keep waiting until we run out of “untils.” Then it is too late. Our plane has crashed and we haven’t done anything about it. We have passed through life, without truly exploring its possibilities; we have been drifters instead of leaders.

One reason is that we sometimes misunderstand what leadership really is. We expect it to come from the outside. And so we wait and listen for the sound of some mighty voice coming out of a loud speaker. But real leadership comes from the quiet nudging of an inner voice. It comes from realizing – as Yamini suggested a few moments ago – that the time has come to move beyond preparing to doing.

That is why leadership is so often found in simple acts of self-expression, when, for example, we challenge a falsehood that has been advertised as truth, when we call injustice by its name, when we go out of our way to help another, or when we choose a career that is less about making money than about making a difference.

Thinking about leadership, we often first turn to the grand and famous. But I ask you to consider your own lives so far. I expect you have benefited most from leaders whose faces will never appear on television – from the reliable presence of a parent, the outstretched hand of a friend, the extra effort of a teacher, and the example of a classmate who challenged you to do better than you have ever previously done.

Not every leader marches at the head of a band and yet leadership is also sometimes confused with certainty. All too often, we follow people simply because they have commanded us to follow; they make us put aside doubt because they are decisive and sure they are right. We admire their certainty and so fall in line. But certainty is no guarantee of wisdom – as Hitler and Osama bin Laden prove.

None of us have full title to the truth. Wisdom comes from the ability to believe in ideas while maintaining respect for the rights and beliefs of others. As critics point out, this quality can sometimes lead to intellectual mush. At its best, however, it can generate triumphs that encompass both mind and spirit. We celebrate the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Nelson Mandela because they believed deeply but also because they embraced broadly – the triumph they sought was a victory not of some but of all.

This is the kind of leadership we yearn for today. Think how refreshing it would be if all the people in the Middle East and Iraq committed themselves to a victory of all. And how much better the world would be if we each truly followed the teaching that is central to every system of ethics I know, and that is to help those less fortunate than ourselves.

It is not my intention this morning to place the weight of the world on your shoulders – for that will always be the job of your parents. But I do hope that when you accept your diplomas, you will be so determined to live life boldly, with largeness of spirit and generosity of heart. I hope you will use the knowledge gained here at this magnificent college to be more than a consumer of liberty, but also a defender and an enricher of it; that you will be doers not drifters; and that by your actions, you will each add luster to Wellesley’s name and to your own.

It is said that all work that is worth doing is done in faith. This morning, I hope you will each embrace the faith that every challenge surmounted by your energy; every problem solved by your wisdom; every soul awakened by your passion; and every barrier to justice brought down by your determination will ennoble your own lives, inspire others, and explode outward the boundaries of what is achievable on this earth.

To the golden Class of 2007, I say again, “congratulations.” Go get 'em and show them what Wellesley women do.

It’s a privilege to be here with you today at your commencement and the 150th anniversary of this very special institution.I remember sitting in the same stadium for my graduation ceremony back in 1984. I know very well that I face a big challenge today as most of you will definitely not remember a single thing I say today.I figured I have two options. I can talk about you or I can talk about me. I realize if I talk about me, the subject is of great interest to me, but maybe not to you. So I’ll try to only talk about me as it relates to you.

I recently read an article on the Y-generation, listen carefully this is the part about you.You are a completely different generation. You are your own and I can’t decide whether I’m happy or scared for the way you’ve grown up. I realize this assumes you have grown up.I know that about 80% of the males in the audience have not yet. Actually, there’s about 50% of the males in the audience who will never grow up. Ladies, please stay away from them.

I asked President Kassing for a demographic profile of the graduating class, and it was helpful. But as Bono would say, I still couldn’t find what I was looking for.I’ve learned a little bit about search over the past few years, so I put my searching skills to work.

First stop, I logged into Myspace to see what students from the class of 2007 were doing. Wow, I’m not going to tell your parents, but you should really keep that kind of stuff under the radar, gang. Anyways, what I realize is that Myspace has become a practical dating service. Just meet a girl on Myspace, within your zip code hopefully. Look her up on Facebook to see what her friends say about her. Search for her name on LinkedIn to find out her career goals. Find her Flicker account to see what she really looks like and if she has cute friends. Then of course, you Google her to see what she has done with her life up until now.

With all that information at your fingertips, I’m not sure what you would talk about on the first date. So you may not even be able to go on an actual date. Just send your alter ego on a second life virtual reality date, and let your digital self figure it out. Is that how it works?

Alright, now that I’ve got your attention let me challenge you by pointing out that not only will you forget most of my speech, you’ll also sadly forget most of what you are taught here. And in fact, if you follow my path and get a higher degree, you’ll forget most of that, as well like I have 16 years out of Stanford Business School. Over $100,000 of my parent’s hard earned cash, and loads of student loans later, and I have no detailed memory of anything I learned.

So what helped me to succeed then? This morning I want to tell you about a few key moments – I call them aha moments – that I’ve had throughout my life. And I’m sure you have already had a few yourself. These are points in time in my personal history when all the pieces of the puzzle came together and a light bulb switched on for me.

My first aha – to keep my edge, I must think and act like an immigrant. Stay with me. There is a special optimism and drive that I have benefited from and continue to rely on that I want all of you to find. This country was founded by immigrants. The genes of that unbounded optimism and free thought are in all of you.

Our incredible constitution and bill of rights, perhaps the most precious written words and framework for a society, are examples of the human achievement that is possible when you benefit from the kind of optimism that I want you to find within ourselves.

I think I was 14 when I realized it matters more how brave your mother is than where you were born. I was born in Tehran, the capital of Iran, a beautiful country with some of the most hospitable people you can find on the planet and more than 5,000 years of history. Unfortunately, today it is also working through a complicated mix of religion and politics internally and geopolitical challenges in the region.

Optimism there today is alive and well in the hearts of the 70% of the population, just like you, who are under the age 30. I was 14 when we left Iran, a few years after we lost my father to cancer. My mother wanted to make sure my brother and I had unhindered access to education. So we had left Iran and were staying in England and planning to take up residence in the UK when my aha moment came.

I’m sure many commencement speakers probably quote Abraham Lincoln or Plato But today I am going to tell you that it wasn’t a former president or philosopher that inspired my aha. For me, it was a hit American TV show about a middle classAfrican American couple known as The Jeffersons. There was this incredible optimism that came through the show. And that hope is what drew me to this country. Even the Jeffersons theme song was inspiring. It was called Moving On Up. I had originally planned to sing it for you in case you’ve missed the reruns. But my ten year old daughter begged me not to.

What the show embodied, what it illustrates for me, was a family pursuing the American dream. And they were moving on up. My image of the United States at the time came from the show. And it all looked very exciting in Manhattan, New York. One night, just one month into settling into our new home in England, I was dreaming of Manhattan.

I told my mom we should move to the States. I just feel that it can be a happy place for us. That’s at age 14 by the way. To my amazement, my mom agreed, sold the house, took my younger brother back to Iran, and a year later we immigrated to the US, thanks to a dear friend of my dad whose son was studying civil engineering at San Jose State University.

I won’t talk about how San Jose looked different than Manhattan, New York. There is something very special about being an immigrant in the US. You come here, and you just don’t believe anyone or anything can make you fail. It is shocking how much confidence you have as an immigrant. Inherently, you’re a dreamer and a fighter. You come to this country to prove something to yourself, to really do the best you can in your education, the best you can in your profession, to build a life and be successful.

With the unshakable determination of an immigrant, you can make things happen. So I encourage all of you, those who were born here and those who were not, to act like an immigrant and think like one. Don’t let anybody tell you that there’s some obstacle that you can’t overcome or some dream that you cannot realize. Believe in your immigrant roots, embrace and nurture that edge, and act on your aha moments.

My second aha, follow your instincts not the money. I’m a huge believer in following your intuition and the power of that little voice inside of you. You’ll make good decisions if you follow your passion and don’t base your decisions on money. I have probably one of the best jobs in the world. I work at Google, and I love it, because it’s fun. I’m the business chief. Some call me the business founder. My job is about running Google’s revenue and partnership operation.So basically, anything that touches our customers and our partners is my job.

Roughly half the employees of Google, about 6,000 people, in about 70 offices around the world work in my organization. And when I jump out of bed, that’s what keeps me excited to walk, drive, or fly to my job every morning. I do a lot of flying these days. I look like a plane. Google is a fantastic place to be. But I’m 100% certain that I would not be there if I hadn’t listened to my gut, or if I had let money get in the way.

Here are two stories that’ll illustrate that. As an undergraduate at San Jose State, I studied electrical engineering. That’s what you do when you come from Iran. You either study engineering or medicine. As a student here, I took advantage of one of the many stand out components of the undergraduate program here, the career placement service. It was in the placement office that I had this second aha moment.

I had engineering offers from several companies in the Valley. However, I always dreamed of working for the premier tech company of the time, Hewlett Packard. So I met a recruiter from HP at the placement office on campus. The recruiter looked at me and said, you have this outgoing personality, and I think you’ll really enjoy dealing with customers. Are you sure you want to be an engineer?

I said, of course, because I had studied engineering, so I was going to be an engineer. But that moment at the placement office, on this campus, really changed the course of my life. When I really listened to the voice inside, I actually wanted to be something else. It’s about trusting those instincts.

Eventually, he and a marketing executive at HP convinced me to consider product marketing at HP, which was a job that required a technology background, but which was more of a business role. So I went to HP and started to do product marketing. Seven years later at another crossroad in my career, I had a similar aha moment.

At the tail end of business school, I became caught up in the investment banking frenzy. I convinced myself that I needed to be a banker for the big bonuses that would pay off the loans.I made it to the final round of the interview process with a bank called Robertson Stephens, when the director of the bank invited me to a baseball game. I really thought I had made it. But then he started asking me all of these questions. Tell me what was wrong what HP. What was wrong with the tech industry? All these negative questions.

Being a positive person and having that immigrant, no obstacle is too great mentality, and by then believing in marketing I said, here’s what I would do, here’s what I would fix, this is what I did at HP, et cetera. After the baseball game I thought, home run for me. The offer was going to be in the mail the next day. What happened? No calls. No news by the end of it. I was worried so I called the director, and he said, sorry Omid, you’re just too positive for this business. And I said “What?” He said, “As a banker, it can be dangerous to be too positive. You have to put the company you’re evaluating down below the line and have them crawl their way back up. You’re too much of a believer, and you’re not objective enough. So we don’t want to make you an offer. Good luck out there.”

Remember that immigrant edge I told you about. The one that can make you find a way to cut through anything. Well, it kicked in. And while still on the phone, and after already being rejected, I convinced him to give me the job.

So he offers me the job. And I walked back to Stanford, and I notice there’s a brown bag lunch being hosted by a new startup called GO Corporation. It was a PDA company and a precursor to all the hand held devices–Trio, Palm, Blackberries–which you are all probably using right now to text and email about tonight’s big party, instead of listening to me. I went to the presentation, and as I sat there my emotions and my heart was saying this is what I want to do–not the bank. And I had another aha moment.

I realized that I had been mesmerized by the money. I was about to work in a big beautiful bank in a sexy San Francisco high rise. But in my heart, I knew that the finance world wasn’t for me. My real passion was being in the Valley. It was technology, and it was being an entrepreneur and a startup guy, wanting to build something.

So in the end I left the Robertson Stephens offer on the table and joined the company I had seen at the brown bag lunch. I knew I wasn’t going to make the money that the investment banking position would have afforded me. And in fact, even with an incredibly talented team of people at the GO Corporation, we ultimately failed. But I was so much happier, because I followed my passion.

I learned a ton, and developed relationships that ultimately helped me develop my career. This is what I mean by following your instincts. That critical switch set me on a path of one start up after another until I finally came to Netscape. While still at Netscape, my old boss from a previous start up suggested I meet with two young computer scientists that had recently launched a search engine called Google and had just left the garage. The end of the story is clear now. But I would not have made it there if I’d gone the investment banking group or the engineering path that I was on when I left this great school.

It just shows you these decisions are not just about math or advice from your parents and friends. But it’s about instinct. You should consider input from all sources, but in the end it has to be right, and it has to fit.

My third aha moment– it’s all about the path. Let me explain. Before going to college, I thought I wanted to be a doctor until my mother, who was a nurse, painted this life of long hours and difficult work family balance. Little did she know that work life balance is just as elusive in Silicon Valley and the land of startups.And that the new model here, perhaps not that healthy in the long run, is more of a work life blend, instead of a balance. Thanks to a strong partner in life, I have a wonderful family that deals with this blend every day and supports me at every step. They’re all here with me today.

You’ve probably been looking forward to this day for a long time. So have your parents. And as you look around and take in the size of the crowd, you in your cap and gown, all of those exams and classes behind you, yes they are, you might not believe that you’ve actually made it, that you’re actually here. You are indeed done with school for now. But let me submit to that you’re not done with learning or understanding your ultimate path in life. You may think you’re an engineer, if you’re graduating with that degree but perhaps you’re the next best organic food or green technology entrepreneur.

You may have studied philosophy but you may actually become the most amazing artistic director of an international ballet company. Don’t be defined or limited by the steps you’ve taken in life or the degree you’ve chosen. Don’t worry that you have no idea what to do next. Or even if you do, don’t get so married to that idea that you miss your aha moments. Get started. But be very honest with yourself. Listen to your gut. Take risks. Be positive. Don’t be afraid of mistakes. Keep learning and growing. You’re only just beginning to understand what you want to be. The path is long and varied and your education and degree was only a priceless first step.

In closing, tomorrow will be your first day in the real world. And as your parents have been telling you for years, it’s much different than the cocoon of campus life. Unlike what we learned in geometry or calculus, for those of you who remember, in the real world sometimes the only way to figure out the proof is to challenge the givens.

Always push yourself. Think like an immigrant. Keep putting yourself outside of your comfort zone. You’ve always been taught to plan ahead and be calculated with your decisions. But this is your startup phase, your chance to keep an open mind and experiment. Certainty is a moving target. Our first few steps won’t be perfect. They never are. But missteps are not missed steps at all. They are opportunities for learning and a new perspective.

I would like to leave you with one last thought. I went to my son’s second grade class this year and his teacher, Mrs. Woodbridge, was talking about her philosophy based on lessons from five year olds to 95 year olds. Sitting at my son’s desk, I learned an important lesson that can sum up all the advice I’ve given you today.

In life, you make the small decisions with your head and the big decisions with your heart. Follow your heart and do listen to those aha moments in life.

Congratulations, and all the best to you. Thank you.

President Swygert, trustees, distinguished guests, my fellow honorees, my she-ro, Dr. Dorothy Height, graduates, parents, friends, what a deep honor to be here today for me.

I think Dr. Gates said it best. You can receive a lot of awards in your life, but there is nothing better... There is nothing better than to be honored by your own.

Thank you. Well, let me just say that everybody I know who has ever graduated from here, and that's a lot of y'all... told me just wait 'til you get there. Just wait 'til you get there. They said to me you are going to feel the love. And Howard, I am feeling you today.

I am feeling you today. I thank you for the honor of being able to celebrate with you today. I am here because my good friend and former executive producer of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," Dianne Hudson, and new member of the Howard board of trustees, said to me, you have got to come to Howard.

Dianne Hudson says, it is our pride, it is a mighty force. You just have to experience it, girl. And she told me this. She said, once you come, it's going to feel like family reunion. And are you going to want to come again and again.

Thank you, Dianne, because it's your passion and commitment to excellence and created continued excellence for this great institution that made me stop whatever I was planning on doing and get to Howard.

And I'm really so glad I did, because I get to see you all. I get to witness and welcome you all to the beginning of your new and fantastic life ahead, if you choose it to be so. And I know that it is there for the choosing, because there is nobody more nurtured and prepared to lead us into an exemplary future than the Howard University graduating class of 2007.

I can say that nobody knows for sure where you will go in your life. What impact you will have on others. But each one of us may have a better chance than most, because you all have spent four years responding to the nurturing, which is the truest meaning of teaching.

You sat in your different classes. You have tested. You have done your reports. You have turned in your exams. And you deserved to be here today. Congratulations.

And all after all of the partying is over, and I know there will be some partying up in here, the anxiety may start to creep in. What do you now do with all of this education? I'm here to tell you today, don't worry. Don't worry about it. Relax. Take a breath.

You are in really good hands, because God has got your back.

All you need to do is know who you are. And I know you know who you are. Because I have, as a part of my Harpo production team two former graduates of Howard, 1991 and '94, Terry Mitchell and Jackie Taylor, who came with me today, and all the way here they were telling me that when you leave Howard, one thing you know for sure is who you are.

Because Howard teaches you to define yourself by your own terms and not by somebody else's definition. So here are a few things I want you to know that I know for sure. Don't be afraid. All you have to know is who you are. Because there is no such thing as failure. There is no such thing as failure.

What other people label or might try to call failure, I have learned is just God's way of pointing you in a new direction.

So it's true. You may take several paths that end up on what might be a dead end for you at the moment. But this is what I also know for sure. You must trust in the words of my favorite Bible verse that say: "And know the lord will lead to you a rock that is higher than thou."

Every one of us has a calling. There is a reason why you are here. I know this for sure. And that reason is greater than any degree. It's greater than any paycheck. And it's greater than anything anybody can tell you that are you supposed to do. Your real job is to find out what the reason is and get about the business of doing it.

Your calling isn't something that somebody can tell you about. It's what you feel. It's a part of your life force. It is the thing that gives you juice. The thing that are you supposed to do. And nobody can tell you what that is. You know it inside yourself.

You know, I come from good stock. Dr. Swygert was mentioning my grandmother who had a dream for me. And her dream was not a big dream. Her dream was that one day I could grow up -- she used to say, I want you to grow up and get yourself some good white folks, because my grandmother was a maid and she worked for white folks her whole life.

And her idea of having a big dream was to have white folks who at least treated her with some dignity, who showed her a little bit respect. And she used to say, I want you to -- I hope you get some good white folks that are kind to you. And I regret that she didn't live past 1963 to see that I did grow up and get some really good white folks working for me.

Oh, yes. So have no fear. Have no fear. God has got your back. And sometimes, sometimes you find out what you are supposed to be doing by doing the things you are not supposed to do. So don't expect the perfect job that defines your life's work to come along next week. If that happens, take the blessing and run with it. But, if not, be grateful to be on the path where you eventually want to live.

Abide in the space of gratitude, because this is what I know for sure. That only through being grateful for how far you've come in your past can you leave room for more blessings to flow. Blessings flow in the space of gratitude. Everything in your life is happening to teach you more about yourself so even in a crisis, be grateful. When disappointed, be grateful. When things aren't going the way you want them to, be grateful that you have sense enough to turn it around.

I spent eight years in Baltimore. I knew in those years in Baltimore that I was unhappy being a television news reporter. But the voice of my father, who thought he knew what I was supposed to do was in my head. He said don't you give up that job, girl. You're never going to $25,000 in one year. That's my father's dream for me. But God could dream a bigger dream than you can dream for yourself. And so I tried to live in the space of God's dream. And the television executives told me when I was in Baltimore that I was just -- it was too much. I was too big, and I was too black.

They told me that I was too engaged, that I was too emotional, I was too -- too much for the news and so they put me on a talk show one day just to run out my contract. And that was the beginning of my story. So I say, even when things are difficult, be grateful. Honor your calling, don't worry about how successful you will be. Don't worry about it. Focus on how significant you can be in service and the success will take care of itself. And always take a stand for yourself. Your values, you are defined by what you stand for. Your integrity is not for sale.

From the very beginning of my career in Baltimore, and I walked in the room and all of the men in the room said to me you need to change your name, because nobody is going to remember your name. You need to change your name and I said what do you want me to change it to? They said we think Susie is a good name. Susie is a friendly name. Susie is a name that people will remember. People can relate to Susie. I said I think I'm going to keep my name if people remember it or not. It is my name. You have to be willing to stand up for what you believe in. If I -- if I could count the number of times I have been asked to compromise and sell out myself for one reason or another, I would be a billionaire 10 times over. My integrity is not for sale and neither is yours.

There are many times -- there are many times Diane Hudson, who has working with me for 20 years can tell you this, many times when we were told that we would lose the advertisers, we would lose the ratings. I said I'm going to take the high road. They said you won't be able to survive in this business taking the high road. You won't be able to get the numbers. The advertisers will drop out and I said let them. Let them. We will chart our own course. We will stand up for what we believe in. And 21 years later, we're still the number one show.

The human death of our integrity is the most we have to offer and I would beseech you to remember what Harriet Tubman said of her efforts to spirit slaves from the plantation. Harriet Tubman once said that she could have liberated thousands more if only she could have convinced them that they were slaves. So do not be a slave to any form of selling out. Maintain your integrity. It has always been, I believe, the only solution to all of the problems in the world and it remains the only solution.

Through your presence here today, you come from a long line of giants whose shoulders you strand on, giants who graduated from this school and giants who never made it to school. I believe in the words of Jimmy Baldwin, your crown has been paid for, so put it on your head and wear it. Your crown has been paid for and so as you walk forth from this place, these hallowed grounds today, the most important lesson I can offer you from my own life is that in order to remain successful, to continue to wear the crown, as you walk the path of privilege, you must not forget the less privileged you left behind.

You cannot continue to succeed in the world or have a fulfilling life in the world unless you choose to use your life in service somehow to others and give back what you have been given. That's how you keep it. That's how you get it. That's how you grow it.

We are in a crisis in this country with black youth. They don't know what you know. They are falling and they're failing. They are dropping out at rates of 50 percent and higher because we, our generation, didn't teach them who they are. We have a responsibility to raise them up, to lift them up to save them, to liberate them from themselves, go out and save a child. And sometimes it doesn't even take a lot to save somebody. As you all know, I built this beautiful school in South Africa, and I spent a lot of time trying to grow my daughters into a future as bright as yours and I can't wait to see some of them come to Howard University.

Recently, I was with them and we were all sitting around talking about careers and the possibility for them and I speak to what is possible. When you see me, you see what is possible. Many years ago, I saw Sidney Poitier receive the academy award in 1964. I was 10 years old and I watched him get the award for "Lilies of the Field." And as he accepted his award, I had never seen a black man on television in a suit. I'd never seen a black man get out of limousine and go anywhere on television. And when I saw Sidney Poitier accept his academy award for "Lilies of the Field," I remember sitting on my linoleum floor baby sitting for my half sister and brother, saying, if a black man can do that, I wonder what I can do.

I stand here a symbol of what is possible when you believe in the dream of your own life. I stand as a symbol of that turtle on the fence. Somebody helped me to get here, just as I know you were helped to get here, Howard, because I know a lot of you came here with only the clothes on your back and a dream for what could be. And so as you have been saved, as you have been liberated, you must liberate others.

I want to share the story about one of our honorees here today. I was in class with all of my girls and we were talking about careers and all -- a lot of my girls say they want to be doctors, because they have seen the ravages of AIDS and they want to grow up and be doctors and some say they want to teach and others say they want to sing or act or dance and there was one girl, one girl who said she wanted to be a historian. And all the other girls started to snicker, because I don't think they had heard the word historian and later that afternoon, I saw her sitting in the computer lab and she was slumped in the chair, and I said, Vindelli, tell me, why are you sitting slumped in the chair? And she said I'm feeling very silly. I'm feeling very, very sad. I said why? She said because I'm not like the other girls. They all want to be really fun things. But I have to tell you, mama Oprah, history is my passion. When I read about the ancestors, it makes me come alive.

So we're sitting there at the computer and I said you know what? I know a famous historian, let's see if we can look him up on the computer and so we punched in Dr. Henry Louis Gates and her expression was you mean he's black? And she said and is he alive? I said, yeah, he's both black and alive. I said you know what? I'm going to e-mail him and see if he will e-mail us back. So I e-mailed Dr. Henry Louis Gates and I told him about my -- my daughter, who was feeling ostracized because she wasn't like all the other girls who wanted to be fun things and Dr. Gates e-mailed back a three-page letter, telling her how as a young boy, he too was one of the only ones who wanted to be a scholar, a Rhodes scholar, telling her how they carried the torch of our ancestors into the future, telling her how it's all right to be what you want to be.

And as she read that letter, I had her read the letter out loud before me. I saw her shoulders get a little straighter, I saw her head get a little taller, I saw her straighten her back and I saw the biggest smile I've ever seen come from the face of a child. And I said tell me how you are feeling now. And she said I'm feeling all right. I'm feeling like I'm not the only one. And so in that moment, through a letter, I saw her get saved. I know that it's possible to do, for every one of our lives, every one of us in our lives to help somebody, to liberate somebody, to save somebody. I know that the motto for Howard is truth and service. And I know when you move through life living your own truth and live through the paradigm of service, you too will be all right. So I beseech you to go forth and serve. Serve first yourself. Honor your calling, do what you are supposed to do. Honor your creator, your family, your ancestors and when you walk this path of privilege, don't forget the less privileged you leave behind

Greetings, class of 2007!

More than a lifetime ago, I stood where you stand now, ready for the capstone of my E.O. Smith career. I salute each of you for all of your accomplishments leading up to today’s crowning glory, and I congratulate everyone who has supported you and made it possible to get here.

I’m sure that each of you has your own plan for what comes next in your life, although no doubt for some of you, that plan is something like: “hang out at my parents’ house to decompress and figure out what to do with my life”. That plan is really more of a “metaplan” than a plan. If that’s where you’re heading, that’s cool by me, but make sure you don’t spend so long chillaxin’ at your parents’ place that they start to introduce you as “my offspring, the Big Sponge”.

I guess I ought to tell you something about my connection to you and about my life in general. I grew up in Storrs from the age of two. I graduated from E.O. Smith in 1987, and my two brothers and one sister graduated from E.O. Smith as well. All four of us went straight to college after high school, and three of four went straight to grad school after that. (The youngest of us spent two years working before she returned to grad school.)

My parents still live here in Storrs in the very same house that they moved into when I was in 1st grade. And my father’s still a professor at Uconn, which he has been since even before I was in 1st grade. Although none of us kids stayed in the immediate vicinity of Storrs, two of us have remained not far away, and still live in Connecticut. When I finished grad school, in 1995 (still most of a lifetime ago), I entered the work force. I had always been a “math & computers” guy, so I took jobs in high-tech, doing software engineering and computer security work. One year out of school, in 1996, I went west to Silicon Valley, which is a pretty classic move for people in high-tech. Actually, people in high-tech-- and other people, too-- often move to Silicon Valley not just because there are cool jobs there, but because they hope to strike it rich.

In Silicon Valley, companies are constantly being born, coming of age (if they even get that far!), and dying often painful deaths. Anybody who’s lived in Silicon Valley will tell you that 97% of startups fail-- because the idea behind the company turns out not to be quite as ingenious as everyone thought, or because the competition somehow makes it impossible to break into the market and make any money, or because the company’s management has no idea whatsoever how to run a company, or because they weren’t able to recruit the right people to do the work, or because actually building their product took longer than expected and so they ran out of funding, or because they were so far ahead of the rest of the world that nobody could even understand their product, or because of any of a million other reasons.

Many people in Silicon Valley change jobs the way people elsewhere change clothes. Some of these people really like the excitement of working for a small company, because things happen quickly, everyone has a lot of responsibility, and they get to wear a lot of different hats. These often people claim that they feel bored working at larger, more stable companies. Other people have rather mercenary motivations: they’re always looking to be at the start of the next big thing, because if they can be there at the right time, they might be able to make a bundle of money.

Sometimes, startups that are looking for funding can’t even pay their employees wages-- they pay them in stock, instead. I have friends who worked at a company for over a year, being paid only in stock. And even though this company wasn’t paying its employees any money, it was company policy that all employees had to work like dogs. I remember going to a Saturday wedding with those friends, and they told me that they had had to get special permission to take part of the day off so that they could attend it! Unfortunately for my friends, this particular company eventually went under, never having managed to obtain enough funding to get anywhere in the world. Some people in Silicon Valley have worked for so many unsuccessful companies that they joke that they can paper their walls with worthless stock certificates!

In any case, at the end of 1998, the company I was working for was busy paying the price for some bad decisions they had made that had caused them to lose some hundreds of millions of dollars. (Back in 1998, people actually thought that that was a lot of money!) They had to close down their Bay Area operations a mere five months or so after they had opened up the office and I had started working for them. So in December of 1998, I found myself looking for a job. At that time, I had a friend, Meredith, who was a grad student at Stanford. Her boyfriend, who went at that time by the name “Sir G”, had started a little software shop with his buddy Larry. These two guys-- Sergey Brin and Larry Page-- had followed a time-honored example out west: they had gone on leave from Stanford grad school-- in this case, from the Computer Science Department’s PhD program-- to start a company in September of 1998. In this case, the company was called “Google”, and it was started to commercialize a research project that Sir G and Larry had been working on in grad school. (Note that since Sergey’s a big captain of industry these days, it’s been some years since he referred to himself by the rather diminutive-sounding “Sir G”.)

Meredith and another friend, Gil, engineered a meeting between me and Sir G and Larry. It turned out that they were looking to hire software engineers for their fledgling company, and since I was out pounding the pavement for a job at the time, we discussed the possibility of me working for their company. Within a week or two, I had come in for a more formal interview with the whole team: Sir G and Larry and their first two employees. Shortly after that, I had a job offer from them, and I had to figure out whether I wanted to go to work there or at one of the other companies that had extended offers to me.

The main down side to working for this company was that the odds were way against it going anywhere, just as the odds are stacked against any early-stage startup. At least my job offer from them was a real job offer that included a salary, and not just stock options. (At the stage I was at in my life back then, not receiving a salary would definitely have been a deal-breaker!) But job-hunting can be a painful and time-consuming process, and I didn’t want to take a job and then find myself out on the streets looking for a job again in another six months or so. It didn’t help any that the company had been founded by grad school dropouts-- if things started getting a little bit tough for the company, I could imagine the founders saying, “Well, this whole business of running a company turns out to be a real drag! We’ve decided that we’re going to shut it all down and go back to grad school.”

So I talked with my friend Meredith, who you’ll recall was dating Sir G at the time. I don’t recall our conversation exactly, but it was something like this: “Hey, Meredith-- do you think these guys are serious about making this work?” And Meredith said: “Yeah, they really are. They’ve been talking to a lot of really knowledgeable people about how to proceed.” So I said: “Do they know what they’re doing? Is there any chance whatsoever that their company could get somewhere?” And Meredith said: “They’ve been figuring things out pretty well so far, and everything seems to kind of just fall into place for them kind of magically. They weren’t even planning on necessarily starting a company, when someone threw $100,000 of funding at them. Then someone else had a little extra space at a data center, so they kind of lucked into having a place to stick all their servers.” I think Meredith might have voiced a few more examples of the sorts of serendipitous happenings that seemed to follow these guys around.

I started work on January 11, 1999. This was the first time I ever worked for a tiny little startup company, which, as I discussed earlier, can be a rather risky endeavor. For me, there were three main reasons I decided to go to work for these guys: 
• they seemed like they’d be fun to work with;
• I imagined that I’d get to work on all kinds of neat things;
• the company seemed to have a chance of success. Hardly anybody had heard of it at that point, but everyone who had tried their product really liked it. As fate would have it, I was lucky, and my analysis above turned out to be more or less correct…

“Fun to work with”? A week after I joined Google, Harry started working there, and he and I started company roller hockey games twice a week in nearby parking lots. (We would play in a parking lot for a few weeks until the security guards or someone noticed and we got kicked out, and then we’d have to find a different parking lot to use from then on.) For a while, more than three-quarters of the company participated in our roller hockey games!

Harry and I also pushed for a company ski trip to Tahoe, and so everybody piled into a van and drove up for a few days of fun at Squaw Valley. Somewhere, there’s some slightly embarrassing footage of me from that first ski trip: Sir G jumps off a big cornice and sticks the landing no problem. I follow him, except that I actually just stand there for about 30 seconds trying to psych myself up to jump off. Finally I summon the nerve to go for it, but as soon as I jump off, I disappear from view, because I crash-land and am not visible from down below where the camera is. Another 30 seconds or so passes be fore I can extricate myself from my situation and stand up into the camera’s field of view, more or less completely covered in snow.

Roller hockey and ski trips are nice, but it’s more telling that Google is at the very top of everyone’s “Best Companies to Work For” lists. Between three meals a day of gourmet chow, doctors on-site to visit without having to head out and sit in a waiting room, cheap massages, and many more perks, the employees have it pretty soft. Life at the company is about as as much like life in a college dormitory as I can imagine. In fact, in a way, life there is a little too soft and dorm-like: since all of employees’ needs are taken care of on-site, it’s easy to forget that there actually is a whole world out there! Employees might never get around to spending time outside Google!

In addition to the easy living, employees have the benefits of being in a culture where it’s a good thing to think big. What do I mean by that? Well, I can remember numerous times when engineers said something like, “I just had this great idea. I could really improve our service if I could have 10,000 computers in each data center dedicated to my idea.” You can have ideas like that at any company, but at most companies, there’s no point in even bothering to verbalize them, ‘cause there’s no chance that anyone’s going to hand you all those computers. But at Google, if you can make a case for the great things you’re going to do with all those computers, you can have them! For a person who gets lots of neat ideas, being in a corporate culture that supports and nurtures those ideas is more important than any fancy-shmancy corporate benefits. Mind you, back when Google was a 5-person shop working out of half a house, we didn’t have 10,000 servers to give to everyone’s pet project. But even back then, we thought big in other ways.

All right-- I realize that I sound like a corporate recruiter! I should move along, since I no longer work for Google, and since I don’t have any jobs to offer anybody. Next on my list of reasons to work at Google: “Get to work on neat things”. Before I started working there, I imagined various projects that I’d work on, and some of them were pretty appealing! I have to admit that the things I actually did work on were almost completely different from the things I originally envisioned working on. Still, there was-- and still is!-- a lot of cool stuff to work on at Google, and I had my hands on a decent amount of it.

Finally: “The company seemed to have a chance of success”. Google survived the dotcom bust years comfortably as a privately-held company, and went public in 2004 in a way that made many people say it was totally and ridiculously overvalued. Since then, its value has gone up by a factor of six or so, and the company is one of the 20 or so largest companies in the US. It has eclipsed its rivals in earnings, market share, value, and just plain coolness. Its name is now a verb in the Oxford English Dictionary! And it has offices all over the planet.

OK, I sound like a corporate recruiter again. No more! So that’s the story of how I brilliantly used the traditional Silicon Valley technique of being in the right place at the right time with the right skills  o become the 3rd person hired at Google. In other words, I had the right personal connections and good luck. Looking back at how things worked out, it was a great decision, and my 50 months working at Google made me very comfortable financially for the rest of my life, or so I expect. But that’s all hindsight, and my Google experience could easily enough have gone very differently. Actually, at the time that I accepted my job offer from Google, I was also considering a job offer from another company in the Internet search space. The CEO of the other company tried to talk me out of taking the Google offer, saying that not only were there very low odds of a tiny startup like that actually going anywhere, but that even if it did survive, the best I could hope for was for it to be acquired for $50M, and then I’d end up with my own very small chunk of that valuation. He even mentioned how a “much more substantial player” was recently acquired for $35M. It’s more than a little amusing for me to look back on the advice this CEO gave me and to think about how Google is now worth more than 3,000 times the $50M figure that he felt was a very generous estimate. And this guy wasn’t a random person chosen off the street; he was the CEO of a company in the same industry segment as Google!

Today’s commencement exercise is an official E.O. Smith event-- possibly the last one you’ll ever attend!-- so it should have an educational component. What can I say now at this critical turning point in your life to help you with your future? If I were a better writer, I’d have come up with good advice and managed to integrate it nicely and logically into the rest of my speech. But instead of a good writer, you have me in front of you; so you got my personal narrative in part 1, and now you get my advice in part 2. There aren’t necessarily always strong tie-ins between part 1 and part 2...

Don’t be afraid to think big or to shoot for the stars. Wayne Gretzky said, “You miss 100% of the shots that you never take.” We all have our limits, and nobody is capable of doing absolutely everything-- remember when Michael Jordan wanted to be a baseball player? But if you aren’t even willing to try to make your dreams come true, you’ll end up settling for less of a life than you could’ve had. While you should always strive for success, you should realize that for many things in your life, failure actually is an option. But when you fail, don’t let it be because you didn’t care or didn’t try.

Don’t be afraid of hard work. Wayne Gretzky said, “The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it.” At the same time, don’t be afraid to spend some of your time not working. In some of my years in industry, I spent pretty much all my time working. At the other end of the spectrum, I spent most of my second year of grad school playing video games! Somewhere in between those two extremes lies a reasonable balance, and that balance is different for different people. Know that with hard work you can achieve great goals, but also know that there’s more to life than just your career. If all you ever do is work, you will regret it. You will look back on your life, and no matter how much you have accomplished, you will wish that you had lived differently. Play time and family time and sleep time are all necessary for you to recharge yourself, to keep yourself from burning out, to get perspective on what you’re doing and what your life means, and to get good ideas for the future.

Respect your future. Wayne Gretzky said, “A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.” What I mean by “respect your future” is: make choices that will make you happy for a long time, rather than just focusing on the next two seconds. Among other things, that means that in everything you do, you need to be sufficiently upstanding that your conduct doesn’t keep you up worrying late at night.

Respect yourself and respect other people. This means that you should realize that everyone is unique, and everyone has his or her own ideas and abilities, and that this is a good thing, rather than a bad thing. Celebrate diversity! The fact that people are different and possess different talents means that when you work as a team, together you can achieve more than any one of you could alone. I used to be a real elitist-- I worked hard, I attended all the best schools, and I thought that with my smarts and my talents and my background, I was pretty hot stuff. When I entered the working world, I was amazed to discover that there are incredibly talented and capable people out there from all walks of life! Don’t think less of someone just because their background differs from yours. (Of course, if people manage to prove to you by their actions that you really should think less of them, then go ahead and do so.)

Even if you’re super-smart and super-capable, don’t discount the benefits of your connections in life. If you can use your connections to get things done, don’t think of that as cheating; instead, view your connections as part of your overall skill set. In fact, when you look at corporate executives and politicians, sometimes it seems like connections are their entire skill set! And although good luck isn’t exactly part of your skill set as such, you shouldn’t be ashamed when good luck helps you accomplish things, either. I’ll use that Gretzky quote one more time here, since it’s everybody’s favorite, and since it’s at least slightly related: “You miss 100% of the shots you never take.”

Finally, always remember that you’re only one small part of the world. You’re an important part of the world, certainly, but so is everyone else. Do things that will help everybody, not just yourself-- think of how great life would be if everyone acted that way! With the complexity and hassles of modern life, it’s really easy to get wrapped up in your own little world. Who has time to try to make the world a better place? Well, even though things seem hectic now, they’re probably going to seem even more hectic later on when you’re trying to deal with your spouse’s strep throat and trying to get your well-deserved promotion at work and wondering who’s going to pick up the kids from day care after school and when do you get to go on that vacation, anyway? Living in today’s society is a stressful business for everyone, and everyone needs to figure out how to find the personal resources to try to make the world a better place.

It’s been an honor to speak to all of you today. As far as I’m concerned, my generation has worked very hard to mess up society and our planet, and now it’s finally your chance to try to fix everything up. I wish you all the best of luck!

Thank you.  I put this ring on my finger 22 years ago, at my own graduation from Niagara University, and I’ve worn it proudly every day since.  It’s wonderful to be home again.

As you heard, I’m a Niagara University Graduate and a Harvard Graduate.  They are very different schools, and you can see it best in their graduation ceremonies.

At Harvard graduation each year, the business students in their caps and gowns jump to their feet and wave $100 dollar bills before their guests, their parents, and their faculty.  Looking down from above, it’s a “sea of money” waving in the wind.  Entitlement itself, become visible.  A dare to the universe to deny them what they believe they have now earned.  It’s a breath-taking sight even when you know it’s coming.   

Don’t get me wrong.  I’m glad I went there.  I often find myself making decisions for my university using the case study approach that I first learned there.  And I met people in Cambridge who have become lifelong mentors and friends.  

But the truth is that it is my Niagara education that I cherish more.  Niagara, of necessity perhaps, was a less arrogant place.  And a more humane place – something I grew to understand to be of infinitely higher value.  

To be sure, the education here at NU was terrific.  

I learned to read Supreme Court decisions here.

I learned to read European philosophers here.  
I learned to write here.

As a math major, I even learned how missile guidance systems are designed.  In fact, it was a brilliant nun, Sr. John Francis Gilman, a Daughter of Charity, who taught me how to “aim missiles at Russia.” 

As an education major, I learned to manage a seventh grade classroom here.  I learned how to observe students, searching for the learning style that worked for them, and then learned to adjust my teaching accordingly.  I learned to think in terms of lesson plans and learning goals.  

But more importantly than any of that, I learned never to wave $100 dollar bills in people’s faces.  

There’s something more to a Niagara degree than just competence, skills, and feeding ambition.  There’s a humanity about this university that I cherish.  There’s a community here, faculty and staff who work together, who know each other’s spouses, partners and children.  There’s a deep sense of dedication to the students.  Time poured out on their behalf; conversations welcomed before and after class; emails returned, names learned and known. 

Those with MBA’s might call this customer-service, but students aren’t customers at Niagara.  That would reduce the transaction between faculty and students to an exchange for pay, even if a courteous one.  That’s not Niagara.  It’s the relationships I will always cherish with my faculty, some who are still teaching here.  The women and men who talked about more than simply the most recent lecture with me, but who talked about life, and goals, and even campus gossip.  

When my classmates from the class of 85 describe our time at Niagara, we don’t often use the words, “we attended Niagara.”  We didn’t just “attend” Niagara University.  We were welcomed in.  We became part of that community.  I suspect you know that experience too.

There’s an old-fashioned humanity to Niagara that makes the university special.  It’s rooted in Niagara’s Vincentian and Catholic traditions.  An ethical community.  Not a perfect community, not a community free from sin, or all the various forms of human venality.  But a community of good people – scholars and professional staff dedicated to both our professional education and our development as good people.  

So why, on your graduation day, this focus on Niagara University?  

You graduate today at an important milestone.  Niagara University is 150 years old this year.  Looking back over that history, one realizes that universities aren’t the buildings.  Buildings come and go.  (Your own for example – as both education and business will have a new building in just a few months!)  No, buildings come and go.  Course requirements come and go.  Individual majors come and go.  Even locations change.  Niagara University itself started in downtown Buffalo before it came here to Mount Eagle Ridge.  

What’s remained constant at Niagara is the love and devotion of the Vincentian priests and brothers who founded this school and continue to sponsor it and work here.  What’s remained constant are the relatively small class sizes so that students are given personal attention.  What’s remained constant is a faculty and staff who pour themselves out for students.  What’s remained constant is that sense of belonging to something that asks more of you; that asks you to grow in wisdom not just knowledge, and asks you to give back to the world around you, especially to those at the bottom of society.  

Niagara University on its 150th anniversary is a blessed place.  It has educated and graduated 150 years of women and men for the world around them.  And for 150 years, it’s cared about more than simply transmitting knowledge.  It’s cared about who we become as people.  It has asked us to integrate the best of our humanity into our professional lives.  It’s asked us to take the search for God seriously and shape our lives on ultimate values.  It’s invited us to follow the example of St. Vincent de Paul - whose statue we passed every day in the campus circle - and to reach out to those in most need.  What we have received, must be given away. 

And there’s the real difference.  $100 dollar bills talk about what you’re going to GET from the world.  Niagara cares about what you’re going to give the world.  That’s what we celebrate here today.  The faculty and professional staff of Niagara University poured themselves out on your behalf, not so that you could learn how to compute net present value, or correctly list the NYState or Ontario educational “regs,” or repeat the criminal code.  But so that you could use these skills to better the world.  You are business people now and educators and criminal justice experts.  And yet, not just business people and educators and criminal justice experts.  You leave this room today with the title “Master.”  That’s a stunning title.  Not “master of the universe,” of course, but “master of a subject matter that can be put to good use.”  

Fellow alumni of Niagara University, you began your education with great ambitions.  Walk out of this room with even greater ambitions.  Succeed in all the ways that will bring you and your loved ones happiness.  But always broaden your ambition to encompass the world around you.  

As you leave Niagara, I think you will find that you are well prepared and well taught.  I hope you will find, as I have, that this institution does something more to you.  That there is a gentle, quiet humanity here that calls us to more in life, and that encourages us to attend to the things that really matter.  Cherish that.  Nurture it.  It is the most precious of Niagara University’s many gifts to you.  

Congratulations my fellow graduates!  May the God who brought you to this moment, continue to guide you in the years ahead.  And may Niagara University - this institution we’ve come to love - flourish for another 150 years.  

God bless you.



Dear Graduates,

Congratulations on your graduation!

I decided to invite our special honorees for this year; they are alumni of Niagara University, and they are symbolic of all the alumni of our past 150 years.  They were chosen because of their ordinary and extraordinary lives.

What they have done uniquely, and in common, is that they have lived their life in the manner of St. Vincent de Paul…it is the way they have lived that is so distinct…they were generous in serving those with special needs in the world, because they learned to be true leaders, that is, to be more concerned about the good of others than themselves.  They are people with a servant heart.  They are people with moral vision.  They are modern day Vincent de Pauls for they saw need, deep need, and responded.

You can read about people who do extraordinarily good things daily; the specialness of the people here that I am talking about is that this is the way they want to live their lives…something in their heart enables them to be generous, to say yes to the great needs they see in the world around them.

The life stories, and the special dedication of these people, is a GIFT to you.  They are models, examples of the life led by people who sat in your seats as undergraduates just years ago.  They call you to follow their example.  They are not boasting.  They simply have had a blessing from God to so be able to live their lives in a special way…and today they are here to say to you…You can do the same.  You must do the same.  We invite you.  We will help you.

Graduates of this 150th year class of 2007, you are talented young men and women, ready to enter and transform this world.  Whatever you do, I hope that you will bring a servant heart that wants to serve others most of all; this is the most important thing that I can tell you as you graduate.

 few other simple words:

Have fun in life, smile a lot, and keep good friends close to you.

Always be people of honesty and integrity…these are the most important things you can own in life, and no one can take them away from you, not ever.

Celebrate a lot…this is a wonderful occasion, and time in your life.

Remember that you graduated in the 150th year of the life of Niagara University…this is a proud day for the university…it should be a very proud day for you personally.

Finally, I proclaim that this 150th Anniversary Year is ended.  I proclaim that this undergraduate commencement convocation of 2007 is ended.

God bless your families and friends here and at home.  May God bless you and always be with you…and may St. Vincent guide your way.


It's indeed an honor to be here today to give the commencement address and to congratulate the Students of the Class of 2007 as well as your parents and friends who helped make this day possible.

We are here today to celebrate an important event in your life. A day you have worked so hard to have, a day that marks the end of one adventure in your life and the beginning of another.

For life truly is and should be a series of great adventures; a series of journeys within journeys. Now, I am sure most of you have mixed emotions about today. You are glad your four-year journey in education is over but you are also nervous about what lies ahead. Are you sure about your next adventure in life? Have you made the right decision?

It is important to remember that all journeys in life begin with a dream, a dream to become someone; a dream to do something important in life that you and your friends and parents will be proud of.

When you were growing up, dreams were, and STILL ARE, a major part of your life. Everyone should dream and then try to make those dreams come true. For me, my dreams dealt with adventure. My heroes were people like Marco Polo, Captain James Cook, and mythical characters out of Jules Verne's novels.

One of my major heroes came from "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" with its nuclear submarine Nautilus and its great Captain Nemo. My biggest dream was to build a submarine myself and sail around the world underwater. To be Captain Nemo and look out of his magical window to see things no one had ever seen before. But all of us have different kinds of dreams, different goals in life to pursue. It is hard to know at times which dream to pursue since so many can run through your head while growing up. It is easy to question your decision to pursue one dream instead of another. To be paralyzed at times by indecision, fearful that you have made the wrong choice and that you may be going down the wrong road.

If you have such fears, put them aside, for life is the act of becoming, you never arrive. It's the journey that counts. Isn't it amazing how much time and energy mountain climbers spend planning and executing their ascent of Mount Everest and the meager amount of time they spend once they reach the summit taking in the view. It was the act of climbing that took them to the top not a desire to get there and stay. The question is which mountain in life should you pick to climb, which dream to pursue. I would like to share with you some important insights I have made which help me pick the mountains in life to climb.

The most important thing I have discovered is not whether the mountain is in Asia, or Europe, or under the sea.

The most important thing is that the mountain you choose to climb is high. I have discovered that if you climb a mountain that is say 1,000 feet tall and fall off its summit and break your neck you are just as dead as you would be had you fallen off a mountain that is 30,000 feet tall. You're dead all the same so why did you pick a small mountain to fall off.

I have also discovered that it is just as hard to climb a 1,000-foot mountain, as it is to climb one 30,000 feet tall. People that climb tall mountains get up at the same time in the morning and go to bed at the same time in evening as those who climb little ones. They have to put up with the same amount of trials and tribulations each day. So what I learned was, it is just as easy or just as hard to climb a tall mountain as it is to climb a small mountain so why not go for it!

When you walk up on the stage today to receive your diploma, having finally reached the summit of your present dream, a dream that has taken four or more years to reach, you will only spend a few seconds here. But when you look out at your parents and friends and see how proud they are, you will realize that this four-year journey was well worth the effort.

What is also important about climbing a tall mountain instead of a small one is that it takes a longer time to climb. This gives you a lot of time to think about what you are doing along the way and it gives you more time to enjoy the journey.

If you can reach the top of a mountain in just an hour or a day, it wasn't worth your time to climb. I have found that if I pick a distant summit in the clouds to pursue, time is on my side and I can have a lot of fascinating side trips along the way. Side trips that enrich my life but since I have that distant summit on the horizon to guide me, I find that I don't get lost along the way. I always know how to get back on the trail once my side trip has ended.

I also discovered that tall mountains frighten people off. As a result, there aren't many people climbing them. The path up to the summit is less crowded, less congested, and in fact easier to climb. So I advise you to think big, have big dreams. Climb tall mountains. When I was growing up, the landmasses of the world were largely explored - the final frontiers were in space and beneath the sea. Space fascinated me, and still does, but the ocean fascinated me even more. I don't know if it was the pull of Nemo or that I grew up in San Diego and the sea was so much a part of my life, literally at my doorstep.

I can vividly remember walking along the beautiful sandy beaches of Southern California searching for treasures washed ashore by the tide.

I remember one day finding a Japanese fishing float which had traveled across the broad breath of the Pacific Ocean, a journey that must have taken years to complete, finally washing ashore, lying there waiting to be discovered.

I can remember exploring the countless tidal pools at low tide. Each was a world unto itself. One might have a small school of fish racing around trying to find a way out. Another might have an octopus hiding inside a tiny cave, hoping not to be seen. Then there was the ever-present sea anemones which closed when I touched them and small crabs ready to stand their ground and fight to the death should I try to pick them up. As I was growing up, the sea was always a part of my life. I graduated from walking along the beach and investigating tidal pools to body surfing and Scuba diving. For some reason, I never had an interest in the top of the sea or for that matter the sea itself. It was the land beneath the sea that held my fascination. Perhaps it was my love of mountains. Every time I put on an air tank,

I headed straight for the bottom.

While in high school I wrote a letter to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, a place I had visited many times before to see their aquarium or to fish on their pier if I could sneak out onto it undetected. A kind scientist at Scripps answered my letter and told me how I could apply for a summer scholarship. I was 17 years old and the summer of 1959 gave me my first great adventures with the sea. On the first cruise, we were hit by a great storm and limped back to shore. On the second, our ship was almost sunk by a rogue wave that knocked out the windows in the bridge and exploded the portholes in the galley. It was awesome to watch the waves crash over the ship. I was hooked for life.

My childhood dreams always dealt with the sea. But before I could set out on a marine adventure, I had, like you, to prepare myself.

Going to college for four years has helped to prepare you for the future, so that you can pursue your dreams in life. By attending class it has prepared your mind. By participating in sports it has taught you the value of discipline and teamwork. By participating in school organizations or student government it has taught you the value of leadership.

So, your childhood is spent dreaming. Your young adulthood spent preparing. But the moment finally comes - like today - when it's time to venture forth. But if your dream is a big one you'll need help, you'll need to be part of a team. Initially, you'll follow, but then you'll lead. You'll never make a good leader unless you've learned to follow. But on those initial journeys in life when you are asked to pull your oar while another leads, learn what it takes to be a team player. Learn how to get along with others. Learn what loyalty and honesty are all about. Anyone can get to the top of their mountains in life by taking shortcuts by climbing over the bodies of others. But if you take that route your time at the top will be short lived; and the very people you climbed over on your last ascent may block making it to the summit of your next mountain in life.

Finally, after working for years to help someone else live his or her dream, your turn will come. And when you lead your team on its first adventure in life, be prepared to fail initially. For no quest is worth pursuing that doesn't require you to pass many tests, take numerous risks. Jason had to tame the wild bulls, Ulysses had to resist the sirens calling him onto the rocks, and Captain Nemo, well, he had to face the giant squid. Every major adventure I have been on over the years has tested me severely with violent storms and the loss of equipment. My first voyage to find the TITANIC ended in failure. My first expedition to find the BISMARCK failed as well. The test you must pass is not whether you fall down along the way, for you surely will. The important test is whether you can get back up after being knocked down and risk failure again.

The journeys you will now begin in life will test you, to find how well you prepared your mind, but the hardest tests of all will look to see how determined you are to live your dream, how strong is your heart. At times, it will seem like the storms of life will never end, that the trials you must pass seem to go on forever, but they will end -but only after your heart and mind have been tested.

I have lived through countless storms at sea. Winds over 100 knots, swells reaching 50 feet. And when I thought I could not last another minute, the winds dropped off, the seas flattened and the blue sky appeared and my quest was reached. Be it the Titanic, Bismarck, Yorktown or whatever goal I sought. For me, Neptune would finally say enough is enough. I'd passed the test. The sea calmed and Neptune would pull back the veil of watery secrecy and there was what I had been looking for all along. There was the truth I sought. But your journey is not over once your goal is reached, your dream fulfilled, the truth attained. The journey is never over until you share what you have learned with others. Then and only then can you begin preparing yourself for your next adventure. Sharing is the final step in a journey when you give up what you have learned. Giving is something that may not interest you right now, but always remember life is never fulfilled, your journey never over until you take time to give back a portion of what has been given to you to others.

So, I congratulate all of you for dreaming dreams and preparing yourself to live those dreams. But it's time to move onto the next adventure in your life and when life knocks you down - which it will - lay there for a second and reflect upon what has happened. Learn from your mistake but then get back up, and don't let anyone ever, EVER stop you from fulfilling your dreams. 

Good luck.

Your excellency Archbishop Wuerl, President O'Connell, members of the board of trustees, members of the administration, distinguished faculty and staff, graduating students - and families who paid for [their education] - honored guests, Dr. Williams, thank you one and all.

This is a wonderful thing, a graduation: And I hope your lives will be filled with many more - not in terms of diplomas, but in the sense that you will have escalating accomplishments throughout your days. I've been asked to aid in that quest by giving you some advice, so here it goes.

First, live boldly. Live a whole life. I have five tips for pulling this off and - let me warn you - they've all been road tested. I learned the old-fashioned way, through trial and error.

Number one, think. You've got a diploma now, you've got a brain. Put them to work.

Catholic University has equipped you with an extraordinary and valuable tool. It's taught you how to learn. This handy skill never wears out, so please use it all the time. After all, the human mind is a wondrous thing. It's restless, always eager for action, always raring for places to go. While you've been here you have developed analytical skills, but they alone won't get you through. You're smart but we humans are also gullible. Really gullible. Just ask the serpent in Eden. Therefore you're going to need to develop some discernment, some common sense.

My grandmother, who was reared in hardscrabble rural Kentucky, used to lecture me all the time about the perils of book-learning. I used to scoff at that, until I got out on my own. I still remember living in my first apartment, waking up in the morning to a weird muffled popping sound. I padded out to the kitchen and felt something cold on my scalp. I looked up and saw viscous orange goo dripping from the ceiling. See, Grandma would have known not to let frozen orange juice sit on the counter thawing without letting the cap loose. Common sense.

Heed the counsel of your elders, including your parents. I guarantee you, they have made some howling mistakes if, like me, they were in college in the '70s and '80s. They probably haven't owned up to them, but they might now, because they want to protect you. You see, they know that you are leaving the nest. And now that you're leaving the nest, predators soon will begin to circle. Some are going to try to take your money, but the really clever ones are going to tempt you to throw your life away. They'll appeal to your pride and vanity - or worse, to your moral ambition. After all, there's nothing more subversive than the offer to become a saint. So think things through. Be patient. If somebody tries to give you a hard sell, you know they're peddling snake oil; don't buy it. If something's not worth pondering, it is certainly not worth doing. And if your gut tells you something's fishy, trust your gut.

You know, hucksters perform an unintended service. Like everybody here, I'm sure you've all been conned. I am such a sucker that I get conned all the time. What happens is they make you look in the mirror and assess honestly the person on the other side. Now all of us love to delude ourselves, making excuses. But you know, the more we resist being honest and doing an honest evaluation, the sillier we behave. If you don't believe it, think of any swinger you have ever seen in your life. Socrates was right: Know thyself.

But see, there's more. Once you've gotten past the mirror phase, then things begin to get really interesting. You begin to confront the truly overwhelming question: Why am I here? And that begins to open up the whole universe, because it impels you to think like the child staring out at the starry night: "Who put the lights in the sky? Who put me here? Why?" And pretty soon you are thinking about God. Don't shrink from pondering God's role in the universe or Christ's. You see, it's trendy to reject religious reflection as a grave offense against decency. That's not only cowardly. That's false. Faith and reason are knitted together in the human soul. So don't leave home without either one.

Second recommendation: Go off-road.

It's tempting to search for comfort, but don't play it too safe. Every once in a while you've got to get yourself into a mess, a scrape, a circumstance that makes you look around and gasp, "Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore." You'll shudder and tremble, but you will have no choice but to rise to the occasion. Let's be honest. Most of us spend a great deal of our lives over our heads in one way or another. Don't reject it, don't resist it, don't deny it. Just make the most out of it.

You see, when you go off-road, when you start taking risks, your ambitions and limits get to know each other up close and personal. You'll also learn never to try to do anything all by yourself. You're going to need help. Lots of it. Don't be bashful. Ask. Everybody you know harbors a secret desire - maybe an unsecret desire - to do something good for somebody else. For every important venture or adventure in your life, you're going to dangle one foot over the abyss of uncertainty and ask, "Can I do this? Am I up to it?" You're going to have to summon a little faith in God, your friends, strangers, and, most of all, in yourself.

When you're going off-road, don't be content with what you know now. The reason you came to college is you didn't know very much. Now you know a little more. But the challenge is to keep building on it. So try something completely different - I don't care, learn something trivial. Learn it well. Sing karaoke, if you dare. Learn to fix something in the house. Help out at a homeless shelter. Start a rock 'n' roll band.

My wife hopes I'll just venture out and start cleaning up my study.

And be ready for the unplanned educational experiences. Sometimes they're the very best of all. If fact, the most revealing moments are the ones that are unplanned. Practice a little daring. I'm not talking about driving with your eyes closed. But something that's tantalizing because it raises the question of whether this particular activity and goal lies inside or outside the limit of your abilities.

Last summer we were in Crawford, Texas, with the president. And you know the president has this love of riding a bicycle off-road. It's a treacherous and crazy thing, plunging down the hills, over seeming cliffs, ravines, up rocks. He loves it. Well, I said, "I might like to try that sometime." I was just, you know, trying to make nice. I was trying to kiss up to the boss.

So the first time out at the ranch, he said, "Snow, you ready to ride?"

I looked around and said, "Well, I don't have any shorts, sir."

And so he said, "Hey, Jerry, do you got shorts?"

"Yes sir." Hands out a pair of shorts.

"Well, all I have are these running shoes," I protested.

"They'll do."

He hands off a t-shirt so off we go. Now, again, it's an adventure because the president, being aerobic in everything he does, plunges into this with absolute incredible vigor, and I thought I was doing all right at the beginning. I'm chuffing along at the back of the pack, respectfully (and also because I was the worst rider). But there was always that lingering fear. At one point he says, "Okay, you're going to need your brakes here. It's straight down, it's boulders. Oh, and the other side, it's a cliff. Watch out."

We finally get to this place where the road parts. You go off-road and there's a drop of about 15 or 20 feet, it rises up again and then goes around the curve. The president goes down and goes "Woo hoo!" Person behind him goes down and goes "Woo hoo!" I'm in the back and I go "Waaaah." But there I am.

Okay, where am I? The limits of the abilities. Which side of the line am I on? Well, I go down. It's great! I'm going full-speed. And then all of a sudden coming up a tree appears right in the middle of the path. Ooof. Everybody hears it.

"Snow, you okay back there?"

"Yes sir. Just hit a tree."

"Okay, well come on then."

I made the rest of the trip with a wobbly front tire which had been bent up in the encounter.

The point's simple. When a chance presents itself, take a prudent and interesting risk. If it doesn't work out, that is okay. Don't worry about that, either. You see, God presents blessings in unexpected packages. Don't overlook them. Remember: no guts, no glory.

Third: Commit.

This is a way of talking about faith. American culture likes to celebrate the petulant outcast, the smart-aleck with the contempt for everything and faith in nothing. Snarky mavericks. The problem is these guys are losers. They have signed up for an impossible mission. Because they've decided they're going to create all the meaning in their lives. They've either decided that no moral law exists or they will be the creator, the author of those laws. Now one road leads to complete and total anarchy. Life is solitary, nasty, brutish and short. The other is to insanity, since it requires playing God. We know in our hearts, intuitively, from our first years as children, that the universe unfolds with a discernible order and that moral laws, far from being convenient social conventions, are firm and unalterable. They predate us, they will survive us. Rather than admitting our weakness a lot of times, we just decide we'll try to get by. And maybe rather than giving God credit, we'll try to look for a cheap substitute.

Walk into a bookstore, you'll know what I mean. The shelves are groaning underneath the trendy tomes promising salvation - medicine balls, herbs, purges, all sorts of weird stuff. In politics, there's a variant that elevates government to the status of God. It says that it is the source of love. It ought to be the recipient of your tithes, but government, while it does pursue compassionate ends, cannot be loving and personal. It treats all of us as completely equal rather than uniquely divine. The point is you can't escape the question of God and you can't escape the question of commitments.

When it comes to faith, I've taken my own journey. You will have to take your own. But here's what I know. Faith is as natural as the air we breathe. Religion is not an opiate, just the opposite. It is the introduction to the ultimate extreme sport. There is nothing that you can imagine that God cannot trump. As Paul said "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." And once you realize that there is something greater than you out there, then you have to decide, "Do I acknowledge it and do I act upon it?" You have to at some point surrender yourself. And there is nothing worthwhile in your life that will not at some point require an act of submission. It's true of faith and friendship. It is a practical passage [of the Bible], especially to marriage.

Tolstoy once said all happy marriages are happy in the same way and here's what he meant. When both people commit, when they say, "You and I are bound together, forever, period, no questions, no codicils, no pre-nups, no escape clauses," then all of a sudden, the temptations become irrelevant, and the glories become possible.

There is nothing like the pleasure of being a parent. Waking up the next morning to somebody whose breath has become the echo of your heartbeat. Trust me on this, it does not get any better. Commit.

Next, get out. (Your parents are probably saying that, too.)

You are about to encounter a world larger than you know with peaks, valleys, pits and precipices that you cannot possible imagine. You're going to work long hours. You'll eat pizza at four in the morning. You'll try to find love in the weirdest places. You'll audition personalities, outfits and styles until something seems to fit but eventually the way you're going to craft your legacy is predictable. You will stamp your imprint on other people's hearts. You're not going to get to do that writing in front of a computer.

I've been informed by my teenage daughter that there's a new trend in high school now: dating. Only it's a peculiar kind of dating because the "datees" do not actually spend time in each other's presence. Instead they conduct their courtship online. Now technology invites us to build communities out of electrons rather than blood and flesh and I'm just encouraging you, please understand the difference between a closed parenthesis followed by a colon, and a smile. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot kiss a cursor.

Now, the world can be a frightening place, and sometimes a computer may seem to provide refuge, but don't do it. We also try to hide in other ways. By looking away from the panhandler around the corner or ignoring the fact that somebody is berating someone for no reason at all. What you have to do is learn those adult wiles that I was telling you about but don't give up the child in you. When kids see injustice, they mention it. "Daddy, why is that man screaming at his wife?" They ask about the things we pretend not to see and we have to step up to. So, when it comes to the world, engage it in every possible way. Don't be chicken. Get dirt under your fingernails. Scrape your knees. Laugh … a lot … at yourself. Trust me, if you don't, others will do if for you. But don't shrink from the pain and the poignancy and aches because they're essential. They bring us together. They are a part of our experiences. They enliven everything you do but they cannot work their magic until you leave the computer screen and get out that front door.

Finally, love. How trite is that? But it's everything. It separates happiness from misery. It separates the full life from the empty life. To love is to acknowledge that life is not about you. I want you to remember that: It's not about you. It's a hard lesson. A lot of people go through life and never learn it. It's to submit willingly, heart and soul, to things that matter. Love is not melodrama. You don't purchase it, you don't manufacture it. You build it.

Every time I buy something gaudy for my wife she says, "Oh that's nice," and then it goes away someplace. The love letters she keeps; I don't know where the jewelry is.

Love springs from small deeds, the gestures that say casually and naturally "I care." That acknowledge what's special about somebody else. If somebody's smarter, quicker, better, prettier, wiser than you, tell them. Learn from them. Don't be jealous. Glory in it.

Now the reason that I talk about love is it pulls together the strands of the other tips I've already given you. I'll give you some examples, another presidential story. I traveled with the president last Wednesday to Greensburg, Kansas. Now 10 days ago, that town was small, pretty and whole. But within minutes on a Friday, a giant tornado reduced Greensburg to splinters. Once-nice homes now lie in matchstick heaps. The trees stretch their barren, barkless limbs toward the sky. It looks like Hiroshima, but with grass all around. It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. I ran into a guy who hadn't had a shower in five days because the water is not back on, and he motioned for me to come up. He just wanted to tell me a story.

He's a plumber. And just the week before, they put a brand new boiler in the local school. Well, the school had been leveled and the boiler was just a hunk of twisted metal. He came and he said, "I got a call from the people who sold it to me. They said they saw what happened and said 'Don't worry about the boiler. When the time comes, we're going to replace it.' " Then he stopped and said, "You know what else they did? They said they're sending me a truck. They said, 'We saw what happened, we know you lost your truck. The one we're sending you isn't new but it works great.' " And then he stood there, surrounded by the splintered homes and Halloween trees, and just cried. He's crying and he reached his arms out and he hugged me. He said, "Thanks." See, here's somebody who let somebody else help. He let somebody else into his life. He went off-road in a different kind of way, baring himself, and then he decided to pass on the favor.

Think not only of what it means to love but what it means to be loved. I have a lot of experience with that. Since the news that I have cancer again, I have heard from thousands and thousands of people and I have been the subject of untold prayers. I'm telling you right now: You're young [and you feel] bullet-proof and invincible. [But] never underestimate the power of other people's love and prayer. They have incredible power. It's as if I've been carried on the shoulders of an entire army. And they had made me weightless. The soldiers in the army just wanted to do a nice thing for somebody. As I mentioned, a lot of people - everybody out here - wants to do that same thing.

To love is to place others before you and to make their needs your priority. Do it. When you put somebody else at the center of the frame, your entire world changes, and for the better. You begin to find your own place in the world. When you're drawn into the lives of others, you enter their problems, their hopes, their dreams, their families. They whisk you down unimagined corridors, toward possibilities that had been hidden to you before. So resolve to do little things for others. You don't know where they're going to lead but then again, you don't have any idea where your life is going to lead. When I was your age, I had long hair, a beard and thought of myself as a socialist. You are going to pinball all over the place, from experience to experience, job to job. And I want you to remember that you've got company. And that if you engage them with heart and mind, with faith and energy, you are going to find yourself on a cresting wave. It'll carry you forward and it'll push you under water from time to time. And some day in the dim and distant future, when you're looking back at it, you're not going to think about your car or your career or your gold watch. You'll think about a chewed-up teddy bear you had as a baby or maybe your child's smile on a special Christmas morning. The only things that are sure to endure are the artifacts of love. So go out and build as many as you can.

And finally this: Wherever you are and whatever you do, never forget at this moment, and every moment forward, you have a precious blessing. You've got the breath of life. No matter how lousy things may seem, you've got the breath of life. And while God doesn't promise tomorrow, he does promise eternity.

Let me make a confession: I've never been happier than I am today, not because I got this wonderful, fancy degree. But because the tips that I've been sharing with you are leading me toward my next graduation. You see, 30 years after I got my Bachelor of Arts, I'm just like you. I aspired to new graduations and I'm just as excited about the future. It doesn't matter who you are or what you do, none of us ever stops taking baby steps. Be humble, be alive, be awake. Take each new step as if it were the first. Then take another. And when you tumble, as you will, when a kind hand reaches out to pick you up, smile, say "Thanks" and give back to them. It may not give you a whole life, but it'll sure get you started.

Thanks.

Thank you so much for inviting me back to celebrate with you today. Thank you President Gora, Professor Whitaker, who is retiring after 34 years of inspiring students at Ball State. Thank you faculty, staff, students, family and friends, I can honestly say that speaking with you today is one of the greatest honors of my life.
It has been 29 years since I last studied here. Yes, for those of you quickly doing the math, I will celebrate my 50th birthday next month, 50 (or as my teenage son likes to say, a half century). So, thank you also for providing the stimulus to truly stop, reflect, and take account of the great lessons of my blessed life so far. This speech-writing journey is the best 50th birthday present I could be given. Entitled ÔFrom the Heart', it's my gift back to you.

Our Web chat three weeks ago brought back many great memories and one of you reminded me of my college job at the Muncie Mall. One day you are studying and selling albums at Musicland and the next thing you know, 30 years have passed and you receive a beautiful letter from your university President asking you to summarize your life's journey in three simple thoughts for 14,000 people in 20 minutes! It has been quite a journey, (not just the last three decades), but the last few months since I agreed to speak.

Maybe our lives have been in parallel this final semester. I have been dreaming, thinking, praying, about what I could possibly say that would resonate with you, touch you, and perhaps make a difference in the next three decades of your life. I imagine your last few months have not been dissimilar as you finish exams, term papers, job search, and dream of your future. It's a bit unsettling. This speech writing process has been somewhat like writing my final term paper, and ironically, I've felt like the student and you're now the grading professor. So, go easy on me, and think of it more like American Idol, and I've already won, and am just back to entertain and inspire you today.

This speech-writing journey forced me to stop and reflect, in a way I haven't done in years. Was there a professional story I could recall that would broaden your perspective? Was there a compelling strategic secret I could share that might jump-start your path to success? Recognizing some of the pressures you faceÑthe constraints of a soft economy and challenges of the digital revolutionÑI have not taken this assignment lightly and thinking about this question has required much time

So, I apologize to my husband and kids, as the process took too many precious weekends away from them, but their sacrifice allowed a great discovery. I realized that the most vital component of my life that has guided every aspect of my professional career is my Character, and its Midwestern "Core Values".  

Do you realize you may already possess the foundation of your success? You might have the answer to the most important test question in life. What if you could answer it now and use it to your advantage versus mid-life? The game changing question is, do you truly know what your Core Purpose in life is, your fundamental reason for existence, and can you clearly articulate your Core Values, your guiding principles? I love the way management guru Jim Collins phrases it for business, he says a "Core Purpose is your reason for being, it captures your soul, with the primary role to guide and inspire. You cannot fulfil a Purpose, it is like a guiding star on the horizonÑforever pursued, but never reached." Walt Disney's Core Purpose is simple: "to make people happy". Burberry's is more expansive: to Protect, Explore and Inspire. What is your Core Purpose, your "life book" profile?

Your Core Values are the soul mate of your Core Purpose and are your purest beliefs, your conscience and convictions. They rarely change throughout your life. "We live by what we believe, not by what we see." Identifying your Core Values early in life will help provide clarity into the type of organization you want to work for, the type of people you want to be with, and the type of leader you aspire to be.

Let's consider this from a less theoretical perspective. If you think your college years have flown by, just wait until someone is actually paying you to do what you love! I enjoy meeting with students as they have visited over the years in New York, and now London and interviewing recent graduates as they tell me all they have done during their university years, and how hard they have worked. I remind them that they were paying the school to learn and work that hard, and ask them if they will learn and work as hard if our company is paying them? I also remind them that their great education is what got them the interview, but it is who they truly are that will get them the job. Getting to understand a person's characterÑsometimes in less than an hourÑis a critical part of making sure a candidate is culturally compatible.

When I think of my Core Values, I think of my parents. My father, who in my mind is one of this generation's greatest philosophers, used to constantly remind me that "you can teach people anything, but you can't teach them to care."  Caring or compassion is a Key Value. Growing up I was always told to put myself in the other person's shoes, to be aware and sensitive of my impact on others.

With Mother's Day tomorrow, it is only fitting to acknowledge what a powerful force my mother has been. Whenever I would ask her if something were okay, or fine, she would consistently reply, "I didn't raise you to be fine." I'm sure Jim Collins was inspired by my mom when, in his book, "Good to Great," he says, "good is the enemy of great", and that "few people attain great lives, in large part because it is so easy to settle for a good life". Being the best I could be was a Core Value she instilled in me from a young age. Along with this, she would constantly remind me that "God helps those who help themselves," and the importance of faith.

Another Core value is Humility. My dad would always say, "When you look at a photo do you see yourself last?" and then would remind me of a line from Rudyard Kipling's famous poem "If". "Éor walk with KingsÑnor lose the common touch..." Funny, I always thought this extreme improbable, but about six months ago I was honored to sit next to Prince Charles, the future king of England, during a formal dinner at Buckingham Palace. After talking with him throughout the evening, and then returning to my daily work routine the following morning, this life lesson became real.

So, with the focus on your left brain, or your education, the last few years, you may not have given much thought to right brain Core Values. But with the world moving and changing so fast, they are your foundation. They offer confidence and peace and their significance and influence should never be compromised in anything anyone sees from you off or on line. The fact that the Core Values which were developed many years prior to actually being on my own at Ball State, are still the guiding force in my life today was an epiphany that only took me 20 years of youth, 30 years of experience, and five months of reflecting to discover for you today. These could be your most important assets, your differentiator in this digital age. If you can clearly articulate the answer to this question early in life, it could be your best shortcut to success.

While Core Values are your foundation there are many other emotional facets such as dreams and passion, fear and insecurity, underpinned by heart and faith that provide additional guidance and inspiration as your career commences.

This speech-writing journey also serves to amplify a few of these emotional drivers. Again, take when I received President Gora's letter asking me to speak. After recovering from the initial shockÑI mean, I'm not David LettermanÑI quickly fell into what I call the Dream phase.  Megan, if you are still with me, this section will hopefully answer your web chat question.

The Dream phase is that wow moment that lets your imagination see everything so positively. It's a state of euphoria, cloud nine, the infatuation stage of a new relationship. You know the feeling. This dream state is a little surreal; you are not thinking, or purely feeling, both are fused creating an energy that fuels your imagination. Dreams are your most exciting thoughts, your future life in 3D, and by envisioning in your mind you are creating your life roadmap. "Whatever we focus on, we become". At Burberry, our catwalk shows are Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey's seasonal dreams. They inspire both art and commerce, and help us see beyond our self-imposed boundaries. These shows also demonstrate for dreams to become reality, they must be backed by passion and persistence, be channelled and largely immune to external opinions and obstacles. As author Napoleon Hill says, "This changed world requires practical dreamers who can and will put their dreams into action."

The Dream phase can also include the occasional nightmare. That insecure state when some part of your mind conveniently reminds you of everything you don't know, exposing with brutal clarity the full reality of the situation. Again, take this speech, why did the letter have to say live, to 14,000 people, that it is the University's greatest tradition, and the most memorable day of your life!

I have learned over the years that just as the dream phase is critical, the intermittent nightmare is perfectly normal. Hill also stated almost 100 years ago "that if you take inventory of mental assets and liabilities you will discover that our greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence," and "the subconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by fear just as readily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by courage or faith." It is how well you manage your fear that determines the outcome of your dream.

In this insecure phase I become a curious student again. So what to do with the commencement speech? Of course I turned to Google and spent the next few weeks reading everyone's from Oprah Winfrey to Steve Jobs, politicians, academics and artists. I also read the experts' advice: what's appropriate, what's not, how to organize, how long, who to thank, and the fact that the majority of you will not remember most of what I've said once the graduation song begins. Fear is simply a state of mind that, managed proactively, makes you more aware, and in time much more astute to subtle shifts going on around you. Fear of failure has been a frequent motivator, and helped keep me passionate, objective, and focused on achieving the desired result.

So, having confused yourself with the facts, you passed the nightmare phase. Your mind is sufficiently sharp. Your confidence is back, and you begin to systematically think through the solution. With the rational options in front of me, my mind at peace, I've learned at this stage to turn off my head and turn on my heart.

You see, if your dreams are your road map, your heart is your true guide. The intuitive, feeling heart will never mislead you, in work, a relationship, or with family. In this digital age we are seemingly hardwired to over-think our way through life, and, almost instinctively to look outside for heartfelt answers instead of within ourselves. We are bombarded with information 24/7 and spend too much time responding to others rather than listening inward. Technology has given us access to the world and its sea of content, allowing us to never speak to another person if we don't want to. Computers and smart devices are among the greatest intellectual gifts ever created for man, but if not balanced with human contact, may offer little to develop ones heart. Don't get me wrong, I am mesmerized by this Digital Tsunami, but Google doesn't have all the answers and are all those people on Facebook truly your friends? With Twitter and texting you can share sound bites, as I have with many of you the last few weeks, but they offer no substitute for real human interaction. In my many years of travel around this amazing planet, I have found that the heart is the one global language we all instinctively possess allowing us to communicate across genders, generations and cultures Ð at times only with our eyes, by a simple gesture or touch.

So with the world at your fingertips, have you learned to listen to your heart, your intuition and your instincts? Have you learned to feel what others will feel before you say a word? Do you understand the lasting impact of a smile, or a simple thank you? Do you truly "do unto others as you would have them do unto you?" Your heart is your guiding force, teach yourself to listen to it, nurture it, and let it guide as you start this next exciting chapter of life.

This reflecting has brought back my early chapters vividly. I grew up about an hour from here in the small town of New Palestine, Indiana where I lived vicariously through fashion magazines. My dream at an early age was to be in the fashion industry. I dreamed day and night, night and day, so much so my father would tell me to take off my "rose coloured glasses". I was dreaming, then began praying, and soon began believing I could make it, but how?

My belief was encouraged by small things, coincidences, and signs all around me. The first was in the form of a little book called "As A Man Thinketh," which fell into my teen lap. To this day I have no idea why I began reading it, but it taught me early on the power of positive thinking, and that the inner thoughts you choose and encourage weave both your inner character and your outer circumstances. Then, larger signs appeared, like the ones I ran into on an early campus visit with my older, smarter sister, who had chosen to attend Ball State. They described upcoming merchandising and marketing program(s). As a student in that program the following year, I don't believe it was a coincidence that I attended the summer fashion [course] in New York. Where, for the first time, I had a behind-the-scenes view of all the things I'd been dreaming about all those years. With that visit, I fell in love. There was no looking back. 

After three and a half fast and fulfilling years, in 1981 I left college for New York City, or, as Alicia Keys so brilliantly sings, "The concrete jungle where dreams are made of". Classes ended and I flew out the next day, with nothing but my Core Values, dreams, heart and faithÑ combined with a great education. I was scared, trust me, but knew I was not alone and kept repeating to myself "I will not live my life saying I wish I would have". At the airport that day, my dad was trying desperately not to cry, and my mom just kept asking when I would be coming home. Finally, as I was boarding the plane, I turned, and blurted out my lifelong dream. I said "After I become the President of Donna Karan, I'll be home". So of course as realistic moms do, she prepared for a long absence. About 10 years later, I was sitting in my new office on Seventh Avenue when the phone rang. Who else, but mom? She said, "Congratulations, you are now President of Donna Karan, when are you coming home"?  That's when I realized dreams have no boundaries if you learn to read the signs of life.

A more recent story begins four years ago when Christopher Bailey, then head designer, and I sat in New York sharing our thoughts of what we would do if I moved to London to be the CEO of Burberry. We talked about creating a great company, the kind of company we both always dreamed of working for, and creating the greatest democratic luxury brand in the world, with the most innovative merchandising and digital marketing strategies. We dreamed of establishing the Burberry Foundation so we could help less fortunate young people realize their creative dreams. [During the conversation, Christopher and I also recognized the similarity of our Core Values.] On our first Christmas card we proudly printed Winston Churchill's famous quote: "You make a living by what you get, you make a life by what you give".

Burberry's annual reports describe the key strategies underlying the company's strong financial results during the first 2.5 years. But the deeper secret to our early success was that 6,000 associates worldwide were dreaming the same dream. Then again, as life would have it, in 2008 the world was rocked by this extensive economic disruption. This could have deeply shaken the team, our company. But with our core values as the foundation, our dream so clear, our hearts so connected, it is not a coincidence that Burberry recovered quickly, and more united than before the crisis.

I know I have made it sound easyÑif you dream it, it will comeÑ but I have learned that there is sunshine and rain (and in London, sleet). Without the dark clouds you don't truly appreciate the bright day. Every graduating class is confronted with its particular tests. In my case, I left Ball State in 1981 at the start of the worst post-war recession, prior to this one. This was also an era in which women contended for equal status in a male-dominant workplace. You face a difficult economic environment and onset of the digital revolution with all its advantages and challenges. Remember, individual opportunities are always present if you have a dream, truly know yourself and focus on the things you can control. Back to Kipling's famous poem, "É if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same".

In writing this speech, I have looked backward to guide you forward. Today, you have heard a little of my journey, along with the wisdom of poets, philosophers, proselytizers and my parents. Many of them wrote early in the last century (not you, Dad). I find their perspectives insightful and invaluable and often missing from today's headlines. 

As you leave the comforts of campus and enter the real world, learn to share your values, dreams and heart with others. College is an individual endeavour, where the broader world is a team sport. The more honest and open you are about yourself, the faster you will connect and cut through the competitive clutter. School has sharpened your IQ and rewarded you with a degree today; life will require you to master your EQ, which will reward you with success in its many expressions.  

Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. As a commencement speech was never in my wildest dreams, I have been diligently working alongside you this final quarter. Our web chat, your Tweets, the focus on today's message have helped bring me more in tune. Encouraging you has inspired me at this stage of life's journey and resulted in the greatest 50th birthday gift I could receive.

Thank you, and in turn, I hope you feel my heart's gift to celebrate your amazing achievement and that you dream even larger (this is your life's roadmap), conquer your greatest fears (they are simply a state of mind), and listen with an amplifier to your heart and faith (as these are your greatest guides). And never forget your Core Values. They can be your greatest asset, along with a brilliant Ball State education.
Congratulations graduates. You are now global citizens. So remember, the universal language is not texted, emailed or spoken. It is felt.   Good luck, as you continue life's amazing adventure and I look so forward to reading your commencement speech someday.

The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for. The most you can do is live inside that hope, running down its hallways, touching the walls on both sides.

Let me begin that way: with an invocation of your own best hopes, thrown like a handful of rice over this celebration. Congratulations, graduates. Congratulations, parents, on the best MotherÕs Day gift ever. Better than all those burnt-toast breakfasts: these, your children grown tall and competent, educated to within an inch of their lives.

What can I say to people who know almost everything? There was a time when I surely knew, because IÕd just graduated from college myself, after writing down the sum of all human knowledge on exams and research papers. But that great pedagogical swilling-out must have depleted my reserves, because decades have passed and now I canÕt believe how much I donÕt know. Looking back, I can discern a kind of gaseous exchange in which I exuded cleverness and gradually absorbed better judgment. Wisdom is like frequent-flyer miles and scar tissue; if it does accumulate, that happens by accident while youÕre trying to do something else. And wisdom is what people will start wanting from you, after your last exam. I know itÕs true for writers -Ð when people love a book, whatever they say about it, what they really mean is: it was wise. It helped explain their pickle. My favorites are the canny old codgers: Neruda, Garcia Marquez, Doris Lessing. Honestly, it is harrowing for me to try to teach 20-year-old students, who earnestly want to improve their writing. The best I can think to tell them is: Quit smoking, and observe posted speed limits. This will improve your odds of getting old enough to be wise.

If I stopped there, you might have heard my best offer. But I am charged with postponing your diploma for about 15 more minutes, so IÕll proceed, with a caveat. The wisdom of each generation is necessarily new. This tends to dawn on us in revelatory moments, brought to us by our children. For example: My younger daughter is eleven. Every morning, she and I walk down the lane from our farm to the place where she meets the school bus. ItÕs the best part of my day. We have great conversations. But a few weeks ago as we stood waiting in the dawnÕs early light, Lily was quietly looking me over, and finally said: ÒMom, just so you know, the only reason IÕm letting you wear that outfit is because of your age.Ó The alleged outfit will not be described here; whatever youÕre imagining will perfectly suffice. (Especially if youÕre picturing ÒProject RunwayÓ meets ÒWorking with Livestock.Ó) Now, I believe parents should uphold respect for adult authority, so I did what I had to do. I hid behind the barn when the bus came.

And then I walked back up the lane in my fly regalia, contemplating this new equation: ÒBecause of your age.Ó ItÕs okay now to deck out and turn up as the village idiot. Hooray! I am old enough. How does this happen? Over a certain age, do you become invisible? There is considerable evidence for this in movies and television. But mainly, I think, youÕre not expected to know the rules. Everyone knows youÕre operating on software that hasnÕt been updated for a good while.

The world shifts under our feet. The rules change. Not the Bill of Rights, or the rules of tenting, but the big unspoken truths of a generation. Exhaled by culture, taken in like oxygen, we hold these truths to be self-evident: You get what you pay for. Success is everything. Work is what you do for money, and thatÕs what counts. How could it be otherwise? And the converse of that last rule, of course, is that if youÕre not paid to do a thing, it canÕt be important. If a child writes a poem and proudly reads it, adults may wink and ask, ÒThink thereÕs a lot of money in that?Ó You may also hear this when you declare a major in English. Being a good neighbor, raising children: the road to success is not paved with the likes of these. Some workplaces actually quantify your likelihood of being distracted by family or volunteerism. ItÕs called your coefficient of Drag. The ideal number is zero. This is the Rule of Perfect Efficiency.

Now, the rule of ÒSuccessÓ has traditionally meant having boatloads of money. But we are not really supposed to put it in a boat. A house would the customary thing. Ideally it should be large, with a lot of bathrooms and so forth, but no more than four people. If two friends come over during approved visiting hours, the two children have to leave. The bathroom-to-resident ratio should at all times remain greater than one. IÕm not making this up, IÕm just observing, itÕs more or less my profession. As Yogi Berra told us, you can observe a lot just by watching. I see our dream-houses standing alone, the idealized life taking place in a kind of bubble. So you need another bubble, with rubber tires, to convey yourself to places you must visit, such as an office. If youÕre successful, it will be a large, empty-ish office you donÕt have to share. If you need anything, you can get it delivered. Play your cards right and you may never have to come face to face with another person. This is the Rule of Escalating Isolation.

And so we find ourselves in the chapter of history I would entitle: Isolation and Efficiency, and How They Came Around to Bite Us in the Backside. Because itÕs looking that way. WeÕre a world at war, ravaged by disagreements, a bizarrely globalized people in which the extravagant excesses of one culture wash up as famine or flood on the shores of another. Even the architecture of our planet is collapsing under the weight of our efficient productivity. Our climate, our oceans, migratory paths, things we believed were independent of human affairs. Twenty years ago, climate scientists first told Congress that unlimited carbon emissions were building toward a disastrous instability. Congress said, we need to think about that. About ten years later, nations of the world wrote the Kyoto Protocol, a set of legally binding controls on our carbon emissions. The US said, we still need to think about it. Now we can watch as glaciers disappear, the lights of biodiversity go out, the oceans reverse their ancient orders. A few degrees looked so small on the thermometer. We are so good at measuring things and declaring them under control. How could our weather turn murderous, pummel our coasts and push new diseases like dengue fever onto our doorsteps? ItÕs an emergency on a scale weÕve never known. WeÕve responded by following the rules we know: Efficiency, Isolation. We canÕt slow down our productivity and consumption, thatÕs unthinkable. CanÕt we just go home and put a really big lock on the door?

Not this time. Our paradigm has met its match. The world will save itself; donÕt get me wrong. The term Òfossil fuelsÓ is not a metaphor or a simile. In the geological sense, itÕs over. The internal combustion engine is so 20th Century. Now we can either shift away from a carbon-based economy, or find another place to live. Imagine it: we raised you on a lie. Everything you plug in, turn on or drive, the out-of-season foods you eat, the music in your ears. We gave you this world and promised you could keep it running on: a fossil. Dinosaur slime, and itÕs running out. The geologists only disagree on how much is left, and the climate scientists are now saying theyÕre sorry but thatÕs not even the point. We wonÕt get time to use it all. To stabilize the floods and firestorms, weÕll have to reduce our carbon emissions by 80 percent, within a decade.

Heaven help us get our minds around that. WeÕre still stuck on a strategy of bait-and-switch: Okay, weÕll keep the cars but run them on ethanol made from corn! ButÉ we use petroleum to grow the corn. Even if you like the idea of robbing the food bank to fill up the tank, there is a math problem: it takes nearly a gallon of fossil fuel to render an equivalent gallon of corn gas. By some accounts, it takes more. Think of the Jules Verne novel in which the hero is racing Around the World in 80 Days, and finds himself stranded in the mid-Atlantic on a steamship thatÕs run out of coal. ItÕs day 79. So Phileas Fogg convinces the Captain to pull up the decks and throw them into the boiler. ÒOn the next day the masts, rafts and spars were burned. The crew worked lustily, keeping up the fires. There was a perfect rage for demolition.Ó The Captain remarked, ÒFogg, youÕve got something of the Yankee about you.Ó Oh, novelists. They always manage to have the last word, even when they are dead.

How can we get from here to there, without burning up our ship? That will be central question of your adult life: to escape the wild rumpus of carbon-fuel dependency, in the nick of time. YouÕll make rules that were previously unthinkable, imposing limits on what we can use and possess. You will radically reconsider the power relationship between humans and our habitat. In the words of my esteemed colleague and friend, Wendell Berry, the new Emancipation Proclamation will not be for a specific race or species, but for life itself. Imagine it. Nations have already joined together to rein in global consumption. Faith communities have found a new point of agreement with student activists, organizing around the conviction that caring for our planet is a moral obligation. Before the last UN Climate Conference in Bali, thousands of U.S. citizens contacted the State Department to press for binding limits on carbon emissions. WeÕre the five percent of humans who have made 50 percent of all the greenhouse gases up there. But our government is reluctant to address it, for one reason: it might hurt our economy.

For a lot of history, many nations said exactly the same thing about abolishing slavery. We canÕt grant humanity to all people, it would hurt our cotton plantations, our sugar crop, our balance of trade. Until the daughters and sons of a new wisdom declared: We donÕt care. You have to find another way. Enough of this shame.

Have we lost that kind of courage? Have we let economic growth become our undisputed master again? As we track the unfolding disruption of natural and global stabilities, you will be told to buy into business as usual: You need a job. Trade your future for an entry-level position. Do what we did; preserve a profitable climate for manufacture and consumption, at any cost. Even at the cost of the other climate Ð the one that was hospitable to life as we knew it. Is anyone thinking this through? In the awful moment when someone demands at gunpoint, ÒYour money or your life,Ó thatÕs not supposed to be a hard question.

A lot of people, in fact, are rethinking the money answer. Looking behind the cash-price of everything, to see what it cost us elsewhere: to mine and manufacture, to transport, to burn, to bury. What did it harm on its way here? Could I get it closer to home? Previous generations rarely asked about the hidden costs. We put them on layaway. You donÕt get to do that. The bill has come due. Some European countries already are calculating the Òclimate costÓ on consumer goods and adding it to the price. The future is here. WeÕre examining the moralities of possession, inventing renewable technologies, recovering sustainable food systems. WeÕre even warming up to the idea that the wealthy nations will have to help the poorer ones, for the sake of a reconstructed world. WeÕve done it before. That was the Marshall Plan. Generosity is not out of the question. It will grind some gears in the machine of Efficiency. But we can retool.

We can also rethink the big, lonely house as a metaphor for success. You are in a perfect position to do that. YouÕve probably spent very little of your recent life in a freestanding unit with a bathroom-to-resident ratio of greater than one. (Maybe more like 1:200.) YouÕve been living so close to your friends, you didnÕt have to ask about their problems, you had to step over them to get into the room. As you moved from dormitory to apartment to whatever (and by whatever I think I mean Central Campus) youÕve had such a full life, surrounded by people, in all kinds of social and physical structures, none of which belonged entirely to you. YouÕre told thatÕs all about to change. That growing up means leaving the herd, starting up the long escalator to isolation.

Not necessarily. As you leave here, remember what you loved most in this place. Not Orgo 2, IÕm guessing, or the crazed squirrels or even the bulk cereal in the Freshman Marketplace. I mean the way you lived, in close and continuous contact. This is an ancient human social construct that once was common in this land. We called it a community. We lived among our villagers, depending on them for what we needed. If we had a problem, we did not discuss it over the phone with someone in Bhubaneswar. We went to a neighbor. We acquired food from farmers. We listened to music in groups, in churches or on front porches. We danced. We participated. Even when there was no money in it. Community is our native state. You play hardest for a hometown crowd. You become your best self. You know joy. This is not a guess; there is evidence. The scholars who study social well-being can put it on charts and graphs. In the last 30 years our material wealth has increased in this country, but our self-described happiness has steadily declined. Elsewhere, the people who consider themselves very happy are not in the very poorest nations, as you might guess, nor in the very richest. The winners are Mexico, Ireland, Puerto Rico, the kinds of places we identify with extended family, noisy villages, a lot of dancing. The happiest people are the ones with the most community.

You can take that to the bank. IÕm not sure what theyÕll do with it down there, but you could try. You could walk out of here with an unconventionally communal sense of how your life may be. This could be your key to a new order: you donÕt need so much stuff to fill your life, when you have people in it. You donÕt need jet fuel to get food from a farmerÕs market. You could invent a new kind of Success that includes childrenÕs poetry, butterfly migrations, butterfly kisses, the Grand Canyon, eternity. If somebody says ÒYour money or your life,Ó you could say: Life. And mean it. YouÕll see things collapse in your time, the big houses, the empires of glass. The new green things that sprout up through the wreck Ð- those will be yours.

The arc of history is longer than human vision. It bends. We abolished slavery, we granted universal suffrage. We have done hard things before. And every time it took a terrible fight between people who could not imagine changing the rules, and those who said, ÒWe already did. We have made the world new.Ó The hardest part will be to convince yourself of the possibilities, and hang on. If you run out of hope at the end of the day, to rise in the morning and put it on again with your shoes. Hope is the only reason you wonÕt give in, burn whatÕs left of the ship and go down with it. The ship of your natural life and your childrenÕs only shot. You have to love that so earnestly Ð- you, who were born into the Age of Irony. Imagine getting caught with your Optimism hanging out. It feels so risky. Like showing up at the bus stop as the village idiot. You may be asked to stand behind the barn. You may feel youÕre not up to the task.

But think of this: what if someone had dared you, three years ago, to show up to some public event wearing a big, flappy dress with sleeves down to your knees. And on your head, oh, letÕs say, a beanie with a square board on top. And a tassel! Look at you. You are beautiful. The magic is community. The time has come for the square beanie, and you are rocked in the bosom of the people who get what youÕre going for. You can be as earnest and ridiculous as you need to be, if you donÕt attempt it in isolation. The ridiculously earnest are known to travel in groups. And they are known to change the world. Look at you. That could be you.
IÕll close with a poem:

ÒHope; An OwnerÕs ManualÓ

Look, you might as well know, this thing 
is going to take endless repair: rubber bands, 
crazy glue, tapioca, the square of the hypotenuse. 
Nineteenth century novels. Heartstrings, sunrise: 
all of these are useful. Also, feathers.

To keep it humming, sometimes you have to stand 
on an incline, where everything looks possible; 
on the line you drew yourself. Or in 
the grocery line, making faces at a toddler 
secretly, over his motherÕs shoulder.

You might have to pop the clutch and run
past all the evidence. Past everyone who is 
laughing or praying for you. Definitely you donÕt 
want to go directly to jail, but still, here you go, 
passing time, passing strange. DonÕt pass this up.

In the worst of times, you will have to pass it off. 
Park it and fly by the seat of your pants. With nothing 
in the bank, youÕll still want to take the express. 
Tiptoe past the dogs of the apocalypse that are sleeping 
in the shade of your future. Pay at the window. 
Pass your hope like a bad check. 
You might still have just enough time. To make a deposit.

Congratulations, graduates.

President Celeste, Distinguished Faculty, Staff, Parents, Relatives, Friends and, most importantly, the 2008 graduating class of Colorado College.

I am going to speak for 13 minutes. I think you deserve to know that this will be a finite experience. It is well-known in the world of public speaking that there is no pleasure you can give an audience that compares to the pleasure they get when it is over, so you can look forward to experiencing that pleasure 13 minutes from now. All the pre-law students just looked at their watches.

This is not the first commencement address I have ever given. But the task of dispensing advice to a group of young strangers, and, worse, the job of reassuring them about the future does not get any easier with time or practice. Current events are no help, as usual, when it comes to dispensing optimism. The commencement address is also an open invitation to pretend to know more than you do, specifically how in the world you got to the point in life where you were seriously considered as a commencement speaker. Ask any high school or college classmate of mine and they will tell you that I would be a serious contender for the Most Unlikely Ever to Be Invited To Give A Commence Address Prize. Then there is global warming — it should be called “global roasting,” “warming” is too comforting — and the economy and the war. China, Zimbabwe. The Gaza Strip. Is there anyone who knows more about these issues than I? As you can see, I’m the one who wasn’t even smart enough to wear sunglasses this morning.

To give such an address is also to walk through a mine field of clichés. Most of which I don’t believe anyway. I am not, for example, a big fan of working hard to achieve something. I prefer the attitude of Max Beerbohm who said that “the ant sets an example for us all, but it is not a good one.” He must also be credited with pointing out that the hardest thing about being a poet was figuring out what to do with the other 23 ½ hours of the day. And even if I did work hard at something, maybe writing 50 drafts of a poem, I would never admit it. Another motto I hold dear is “If at first you don’t succeed, hide all evidence that you ever tried.”

One consolation every commencement speaker can rely on is the universal truth that no one ever remembers their commencement address. It’s like choosing the music for your wedding. You are much too excited to hear a note of it. I frankly have no recollection of who my college commencement speaker was, yet I seem to have muddled through life ok without the benefit of his — or her — timely advice.

One reason such addresses are quickly forgotten is that the focus of them tends to be The Future. You have gone to college and managed to graduate. That’s all well and good, the speaker will tell you, but now you must face…. the Future. You should imagine some scary organ music in the background every time I say the word. Such speakers want to give you the impression that you are teetering on the brink of a dizzying cliff, at night, in the rain. That dark area below you into which you are about the plummet is… the Future.. Of course, many elect to simply avoiding the Future by going to graduate school, but let me assure all of you that the Future will never arrive and that no one has ever experienced it. Remember when you were in high school, college was the future. Well, now college is the past. What happened? It’s a mystery. Even with a Time Machine, the future you may visit immediately becomes your new Present. You know, I just remember something my commencement speaker said. He (or she) said that the past was behind us and the future lay ahead--something I had already picked up in a history class.

So much attention to time, very odd, especially for people freshly graduated from college who justifiably feel they have all the time in the world. Maybe today we should take another look at the subject. From my experience, there are two basic ways to regard time, or anything else: The Pragmatic and the Poetic.

The Pragmatic tend to think of the past as a body of tradition to be preserved and/or a reservoir of errors and miscalculations that we can learn from and apply to the Future. For the Poetic, the past is simply a source of nostalgia and regret. Susan Sontag, a confirmed subscriber to the Poetic view, once wrote: “Just wait until now becomes then and you will see how happy we were.”

As for the Future, the Pragmatist thinks of it not only as an opportunity to avoid repeating the blunders of the past, but also a door that opens onto opportunities for growth and improvement.. Robert Lewis Stevenson, representing the Pessimistic view once said concerning the Future that “everybody sooner or later will sit down to a banquet of consequences,” to which I can only add “Pass the butter.” The Poetic hold a simpler view; for them, the Future is simply Death. And that is why the consuming subject of literature is Death. Or should we say misery leading to Death? Many of you know this intimately. If you majored in English here at Colorado College, you actually majored in Death. Take any anthology of literature and remove all the poems, stories, and plays that address the subject of human mortality and what remains will add up to little more than a pamphlet, a brief brochure of literature.

And that leaves the Present, that elusive moment where everything takes place but is moving too fast to actually apprehend. I am amused by Philip Lopate’s feeling that the Present is vastly overrated and actually irritating because it keeps interfering with two of his favorite anxieties: lamenting over the past and worrying about the future. It’s takes a certain temerity to actually disparage the Present. It is too fleeting even to contemplate.. We can assess the present only after it has passed. Or so we may think.

There is one way to access the present, and poetry never tires of pointing this out. You do so by slowing down. Poetry on the page even helps you to do this by forcing you to decelerate as you are reading it. You simply cannot read a stanzas with line-breaks at the same clip that you read the sports section of The Denver Post. To even approach the present, it is necessary to stop what you are doing whether it’s filling out a form or going grocery shopping — chores you decided to do in the past for the sake of the future. Such activities ask only that you go through the motions.

Here is an analogy which admittedly may strike you as a little crackpot. Matter is composed of atoms and subatomic particles. Through the use of a particle accelerator it is possible to make these tiny bits collide which releases energy. Time, on the other hand, is composed of moments. And by arresting one of those moments, by concentrating fully on it, by smashing it under the intensity of your gaze. an energy will be released. Instead of warning you not to try this at home; I am encouraging you to try it at home and anywhere else you can.

Before I return to that essential point about your involvement in the present moment, let me share with you my Top Ten thoughts on the subject of Time:

10) Time is not money. Time is time.
9) Time is more valuable that money.
8) Magazines largely devoted to reporting the weight gains and losses of celebrities are a waste of time.
7) St Augustine said that he understood the concept of Time perfectly until he started thinking about it.
6) In the past time was measured not in months and hours, but in birdsong, the brightness moonlight, and the migration patterns of animals.
5) In the words of James Brown: “Money won’t change you, but Time will take you out.
4) When your time is over, you will be remembered for what you did, not for what you never got around to doing. No eulogist at your funeral will say “Too bad she never signed up for that yoga class.” Or “A pity he never followed up on those Italian lessons.” So don’t waste even more time worrying about the things on your “To Do” list.
3) When your time is done, you will not be remembered for what clothes you wore or what kind of car you drove. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a letter to his daughter as she was beginning college. The letter is full of fatherly advice about such things as the importance of studying and the dangers of boys. Finally, at the end of the letter he adds “Don’t spend a lot of time on your hair.” 
2) There really is no time like the present. But there is no time like the past or the future either, so what are you going to do?
1) The most striking definition of Time that I know comes from Martin Amis who called time “that mysterious, inexorable force that eventually will make everyone look and feel like hell.”

To return to our theme, it must be said that Time with a capital T which ensures our Mortality with a capital M is the consuming subject of Poetry, whose most repeated theme is the theme of carpe diem. As you know, college graduates,carpe diem does not mean the fish of the day. Carpe diem poetry urges us to seize our days, to carpe our diems simply because we do not have an unlimited supply of diems given to us. The echoing song of carpe diem is meant as a check, a corrective to the presumptuousness of walking on this earth taking life for granted.

Sometimes we need an event to shock us into the present, an event so disruptive that it does not allow us to continue wallowing in the past or putting off things until an indefinite manana. Manana by the way does not mean “tomorrow”: it means “not today.”

In the wake of the terrorist arracks on September 11th, many people, especially in New York City, spoke of how the event prompted them to make adjustments in their personal lives, to speed things up. An engaged couple who had planned to marry the following year decided to get married the following week. Plans that had been put off jumped to the tops of people’s lists. Without knowing it, people were simply following the advice that poetry has been delivering since the Roman poet Horace wrote the words carpe diem quam minimum credula postero — seize the day and trust little in the future – in the first century before Christ. Some of us require a catastrophic experience to remind us that we are indeed alive. Some need major surgery to realize that life is precious. Some have to go through a windshield to see that today is all we are given.. Others know this from their reading of poetry—a somewhat less traumatic experience.

And the corollary to carpe diem — a vein that runs deeply through the rock of poetry – is gratitude, gratitude for simply being alive, for having a day to seize. The taking of breath, the beating of the heart. Gratitude for the natural world around us — the massing clouds, the white ibis by the shore. In Barcelona a poetry competition is held every year. There are three prizes:. The third prize is a rose made of silver, the second prize is a golden rose, and the first prize: a rose. A real rose. The flower itself. Think of that the next time the term “priorities” comes up.

Let me end with the wish that many moments lie ahead of you, that you don’t squander your time by looking through rose-colored glasses into the past or trying to look into the Future through a blindfold, or reading those aforementioned glossy magazines.

You must have known when you invited a poet to speak to you, you would not get out of here without a poem, one for today on the subject of filial gratitude because a good place to start expressing your gratefulness is with your parents who brought you into being and made it possible for you to enjoy the happy milestone that we are here to celebrate today:

The Lanyard

The other day as I was ricocheting slowly 
off the pale blue walls of this room,
bouncing from typewriter to piano,
from bookshelf to an envelope lying on the floor,
I found myself in the L section of the dictionary
where my eyes fell upon the word lanyard.

No cookie nibbled by a French novelist
could send one more suddenly into the past--
a past where I sat at a workbench at a camp
by a deep Adirondack lake 
learning how to braid thin plastic strips
into a lanyard, a gift for my mother .

I had never seen anyone use a lanyard
or wear one, if that's what you did with them,
but that did not keep me from crossing
strand over strand again and again
until I had made a boxy
red and white lanyard for my mother.

She gave me life and milk from her breasts,
and I gave her a lanyard.
She nursed me in many a sick room,
lifted teaspoons of medicine to my lips,
set cold face-cloths on my forehead,
and then led me out into the airy light

and taught me to walk and swim,
and I, in turn, presented her with a lanyard.
Here are thousands of meals, she said,
and here is clothing and a good education.
And here is your lanyard, I replied, 
which I made with a little help from a counselor.

Here is a breathing body and a beating heart,
strong legs, bones and teeth,
and two clear eyes to read the world, she whispered,
and here, I said, is the lanyard I made at camp.
And here, I wish to say to her now, 
is a smaller gift – not the archaic truth

that you can never repay your mother,
but the rueful admission that when she took 
the two-tone lanyard from my hands, 
I was as sure as a boy could be
that this useless, worthless thing I wove
out of boredom would be enough to make us even.

One final wish: Salvador Dali once said that “Every morning when I waken, I experience a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador Dali.” May you graduates waken every morning to experience the supreme pleasure of being yourselves.

Former President Bush, on this 80th birthday, called me and asked me to skydive with him because he had seen me in all of these movies doing all these jumps. Those are stunt guys doing that. So when he asked me I go, “Okay.” I thought, “I’ve never jumped before. I need to go and see if I can even do this.” I went outside of L.A. and did a couple of jumps and decided I could do this. We went to Texas and I jumped with him. It was actually right outside of where my wife and I’s ranch is.

I want to thank you all for inviting me here this morning, I guess voting for me to come here this morning. I have to tell you, I don’t do this very often. In fact, I don’t do it at all. This is my first commencement speech at a university.

I hope after you hear my testimony, you’ll see how instrumental God has been in my life. I really didn’t know what God’s plans were for me until about 10 years ago. Let me give you my journey in life. I was born in Oklahoma into poverty. My family was very poor. My mom was an incredible Christian woman. She kept me and my brothers in church and I got baptized when I was 12 years old. I kept my Christian faith all the way through school. My father was an alcoholic so he was very seldom in my life.

I grew up extremely shy and introverted, also non athletic. I went through school and never once got up in front of the class to give a book report or anything like that. Every time a teacher would ask me to get up and give a report, I would sit at my desk and shake my head no because I was afraid of saying something wrong and getting embarrassed. I was getting embarrassed sitting there anyway. My face would turn red. I graduated from high school and decided to join the military.

I joined the Air Force and was sent to Korea. That was my first introduction to the martial arts. I started training then, and by the time I left I was a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a brown belt in Judo. I came back to the States and was stationed in California in 1961 so not many people knew anything about martial arts. I started a martial arts club. I sent out flyers for me to invite people so that I could give a demonstration. I thought, “If I do a demonstration that means I’ll have to say something.” I wrote a speech that was about a half of a page and for two weeks memorized it. I could say it forwards and backwards, this was 1961 and I can still remember it very vividly.

I walk into a gym with 500 people there, the microphone is sitting on the floor, and I pick it up and say, “Good evening ladies and gentlemen. My name is Chuck Norris and I’d like to welcome you here.” That’s the last thing I remember. The next thing that I remember, I was walking out to the middle of the gym to do my demonstration and I’m thinking, “Did I say anything? Did I continue my speech?” To this day, I still don’t know what I did.

What that did was it cracked that egg of insecurity that I’d carried around for 21 years. I kept forcing myself to do it until my egg finally cracked open. When I got discharged from the service I opened up my first martial arts school in Las Angeles. I thought “How can I get students in my school?” I decided to become a competitor, a fighter. So I took three weeks off and went to Salt Lake City. I took three of my students who won, and I lost. I drove back while my students held their trophies.

Driving back I thought to myself, maybe I’m not cut out to be a fighter. The Holy Spirit said to me, “The only time you lose at something is when you don’t learn from that experience.” I thought, “Okay Lord. I may lose again, but I’ll never lose the same way twice.”

I finally fought in the Las Angeles Open Championship, which was ultimately my goal, and I won it. I thought that was great and if I could win the L.A. maybe I could win the state title. So I fought for the state title in 1965 and I won that. I thought if I did the state, why not the national? So I fought for the national title and I won that. I thought if I did the national why not the international, which is the largest amateur title in the world. In 1967 I fought for the International Grand Championship and I won that.

Now I was going to retire and concentrate on my teaching and my schools. The promoter for the internationals said “Chuck, if you can win the internationals twice in a row, you can inscribe your name into a big silver bowl.” I had to get my name in that bowl. So I came out of retirement and in 1968 I won it for the second year. I retired again and went back to my teaching. Then I got a call from a promoter in New York who asked me to fight for the World Championship in Madison Square Garden, New York City. I thought about it and went to New York and fought and won the middle weight title.

Do you guys know who Bruce Lee is? Do you remember him? He was there and he was doing a TV series in the 60’s called the Green Hornet. After the fight in New York the promoter introduced us and we started talking and decided to start working out together in Las Angeles. Bruce and I trained for a couple of years together and then he left for Hong Kong to pursue his movie career.

I didn’t hear from him for a couple of years and then out of the blue I get a call from him. He told me he had done two movies in Hong Kong that were hugely successful and now he was going to do a movie in Rome, Italy and he wanted to do a fight scene in the coliseum just like two gladiators fighting. He asked me to be his opponent in this movie. Jokingly I said, “Who wins this fight?” He said “I win! I’m the star of this movie.” I said, “I see, you want to beat up the world champion?” He said, “No, I want to kill the world champion.”

My schools were doing exceptionally well and a company called to tell me that they wanted to buy my schools and open up “Chuck Norris Schools” all over the country. I had three schools at the time.

I ended up selling my schools to this company and two years later they went bankrupt and I lost all my schools.

I asked the Lord what I was going to do. I thought my life would be teaching martial arts but I guessed that that was not what my mission was. So I waited to see what it wound up being. I ended up teaching private students and teaching seminars to support my family. Steve McQueen was one of my private students and he asked me what I was going to do without my martial arts schools. He asked if I had ever thought about being an actor. I started laughing. I had never even done a high school play. He said, “There’s just something about you that I like and only the camera can tell.” He encouraged me to pursue it.

My philosophy of life then and now is anything I take on I’m going to finish it. So I decided I would pursue an acting career. I had no money and I had to take acting classes so I went to acting school on my GI Bill.

I remember going to my first audition. I tried out for a little tiny part in a movie. I go there and it’s what they call a “cattle draw” where hundreds of people are showing up for the same part. So I ride there and there are 100 actors there and a lot of them I recognized from television. I thought “Golly, I wonder if I could get there autograph.” I didn’t think this was going to work. I’m going to have to try another angle, so I wrote my own screen play called Good Guys Wear Black.

I went around for four years trying to sell this script and me to these producers in Hollywood. They would see me because they wanted to see what a world champion looked like but they had no intention on hiring me. Finally I found a young producer who was willing to gamble on me. We wound up doing Good Guys Wear Black. After I finished the film, no studio wanted it. So we made tapes of the movie and went around to all these towns and I did all these demonstrations promoting Good Guys Wear Black and it became a very successful film.

Then I did a movie where I played a professional fighter. Then I did my first Ninja movie. My career started building. Unfortunately I got sucked into the entertainment world of Hollywood and I wound up drifting from my faith. It’s amazing because at that time I had done many films and I had fame and fortune but I was very unhappy. I couldn’t figure out why. I thought the more I worked the happier I would be but the harder I worked the more famous I got, the bigger the hole in my heart became. I couldn’t figure out why that was happening.

Then I got offered to do the series Walker, Texas Ranger and I decided to do that. If I was going to do that series I wanted to make it very family oriented. I started doing the show and it became very successful. Again, I didn’t have that joy, that happiness that I felt I should have in my life. I couldn’t figure out why.

During my film career I got a divorce from my first wife and it had been 14 years since then. My best friend was there to tell me that I needed someone in my life. He knew a woman he wanted me to meet, my wife Gina. Gina is a strong Christian woman. We got married. I started to do Walker and I’d get up and she’d be reading the Bible. She read the Bible every morning. She offered to read it aloud to me. She started reading the Bible aloud to me in the mornings and the Holy Spirit called me; it said “Chuck, it’s time to come to me.” I did, I renewed my faith.

From there, Gina and I started doing a show on TV and I was hot for the Lord. I still am today. My mom would always say, “God has plans for you.” and I always wondered what they were. I always thought it was the film career but God wasn’t a part of me during that.

I started a foundation called Kickstart. Being a martial artist for 15 years, I taught thousands and thousands of young people and I was able to help them through the philosophy of the martial arts. I thought what about the millions of kids in America whose parents can’t afford to send them to a commercialized martial arts school? How can I reach them? So I decided to start this program teaching the martial arts in the inner city middle schools, funding it ourselves so these kids could come and train for free.

This was over 10 years ago. We’ve graduated over 150,000 kids. I have to tell you about one young boy, who is an incredible success story for us. He was a troubled young man. He was getting into trouble. I teach this to middle school, 6th, 7th and 8th grade because that’s when kids start to drift off. They’re young and impressionable and we think we can get them on the right track in life.

Anyway, this young kid was a gang member. When you join our program you have to break all gang ties because the martial arts group is your gang. We were teaching him at the 6th grade. We kept catching him with his gang friends. We told him he could not associate with his gang members. He squeezed through the 6th grade with a D average. Then, through the summer, he broke off his gang ties and built his relationships with his martial arts friends. In the 7th grade he got a C average. The 8th grade he got a B average. The 9th through the 12th he got straight A’s and got a full scholarship to MIT.

The martial arts turned my life around. I feel like it turns thousands of kids, who grew up like I did, it turns their lives around. I would like to leave this with all of you. Proverbs 19:21 says “Many are the plans in a man’s heart, but the Lord directs his steps.” The Lord also means women when he says “men.”

The Lord had directed my steps for many years and he continues to do so. I hope you’ll let him direct your steps because if you do you can’t go wrong.

Thank you very much.

First, I would like to say thanks to all of you at Niagara University for bringing me back to the area where I was born. I wish to thank especially President Joseph Levesque and Dr. John Stranges. And I want to express appreciation for my dear wife and scholarly colleague Susan Carson who has to listen to me give another talk. And thanks to the graduates, because they, not to hear the commencement speaker, are the reason we are all gathered here.

Commencement speakers typically offer gratuitous advice to impatient graduates who mainly want advice that is concise; therefore, aware as I am that my remarks are among the few remaining obstacles to your celebrations with family and friends, I’ll offer a few easy-to-digest bits of advice and only one larger piece of advice that might be harder to digest – protein to go with the finger food.

But first let me say that, on this special day for me and for all of you, I’m pleased to be here, despite the fact that two days ago I was in Hawaii. Which brings me quickly to my first bit of finger-food advice, which is that all of you should visit Hawaii, soon – I suggest you do it before all of your classmates get there and crowd-up the place.
I was there to relax, of course, but also to get some writing done, which brings me to my second piece of advice – find ways to make work seem like play or perhaps make play into something that you get paid to do.
I was in Hawaii writing an essay review about Taylor Branch’s magnificent three-volume historical epic America in the King Years, which is the best single narrative yet written about the history of the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. It is also the best single source of historical insight we are likely to have to help us make sense of the contemporary state of American politics and race relations. 

You’ll learn in particular why Branch gives his trilogy such a provocative title, given that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and many other political leaders of the period would have been shocked the learn that they were living in the King years. And this comment about Branch’s trilogy leads to another piece of advice: read it. It’s great summer reading – a fascinating, engrossing page turner. I assure you that you’ll enjoy turning more than 2000 pages of narrative, but you should notice that my advice gradually becomes more difficult to follow.

I greatly admired Branch’s achievement as a historian and as a biographer of the person I’ve come to know well in the more than two decades since Mrs. Coretta Scott King selected me to edit her late husband’s papers. Branch states in his first volume, Parting the Waters, that he did not intend to write a biography, and his volumes are about much more than King. They also include sharply etched portraits of presidents and Mississippi sharecroppers, of Malcolm X and J. Edgar Hoover and Bobby Kennedy, of those who planned the American intervention in Vietnam and those who vigorous protested against it, and of many other people you will enjoy seeing so vividly depicted. 

Yet, despite my admiration for Branch, I felt some disappointment after reading the final volume, because Branch could not answer the question that drives my own long-term investigation of King’s life. Even after detailing every aspect of King’s public life and exposing much of his private life, I still found myself asking the essential biographical question: Who was King, really? I suspect that I’ll still be asking this question after I finish (hopefully sometime before senility arrives) the final fourteenth volume of The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. I’ll still want to know who King was, apart from the achievements that brought him fame, apart from his public roles as a minister and civil rights leader, and his private roles as a son, spouse, father, close friend, and even illicit lover. Who was he, really?

I think most of us, not just biographers, agree that it’s important to seek answers to this question about identity – who are we, apart from our social roles and the expectations others have for us? We believe that, underneath our social selves, there is an inner private region of our mind where our conscience, our character, our soul resides. Some people equate this region with God. It is that place where we seek and sometimes find honest answers to difficult questions of identity. Who are we, really? Or, who should we be?

And this is where I offer my non-finger-food advice, which is that you ask this  question of yourself, especially during this period when you are changing identities from graduate student to advanced degree holder and then perhaps to student once again or to employed or unemployed ex-student as the case may be. Who am I, really? And of course the kicker is that word “really,” because all us have easy public answers to the identity question. We often want to present ourselves as simply the sum total of our social roles, our titles, our degrees, our accomplishments. We are our reputations, especially if our reputation is mostly good. Or, we are dutiful children, loyal, loving, dependable spouses, parents, friends, and other kinds of relations. 
But we also know, deep inside, that these are just the superficial, transitory expressions of who we are. They are the things that we can change or abandon when they conflict with some deeply-rooted idea of the person we want to be or the person, good and bad, we know we are, really.

I think you in this audience would be likely to agree that serious self-examination is good spiritual protein, even when we get used to the finger food of easy answers to the identity question. Even if we put off self-examinations of our souls, as we sometimes put off medical and dental examinations, we still recognize the advice to have them is wise, particularly when we would give it to other people. 

We are especially concerned about the real identities of leaders and public figures who influence or control other people. With politicians, in particular, we need to believe that they are who they say they are, that they really believe what they say they believe. We need to believe that presidents, for example, are people worthy of our trust, that the people we elect are not scoundrels or fools, that they have inner convictions as well as political positions. We need to believe that sometimes they venture into that inner region of their minds where conscience, character, integrity, and spiritual strength reside.

We hope that, when our political leaders go into this inner sanctum, the room is not empty. We hope that it has been visited more than once during adulthood. In short, we want our political leaders to be authentic people of integrity and character, even though we know that political campaigns emphasize the creation of manufactured personas. We assume that we, at least, are capable of distinguishing the real from the false; it is those who vote for the other candidate who fall victim to spin. We at least can determine which candidate really shares our values. We can determine which candidate is like us but at the same time somewhat better than us.

I suspect that Barack Obama confronts an authenticity problem with many voters who are confused by his unusual mix of identities. Many Americans do not recognize him as similar to anyone they know, at least in the sense that they believe they know Hillary Clinton or similar people or John McCain or similar types. Some of this unfamiliarity is rooted in racial difference, but this does not explain why black Americans have become comfortable with a politician who is half-white, did not grow up in a black family or a black community, and has had experiences that are very different than those that typify black Americans. 
Obama’s identity is hardly obscure, given that he has presented himself to the world in best-selling books and nationally-broadcast oratory. Few candidates for president have ever been so successful in presenting his or her life to a mass audience through all varieties of media from books to Facebook.

But for many white Americans, Obama’s odd mixture of identifies produces fears that he is not who he says he is – that he is not a complex, interracial, Harvard-educated, former community organizer and constitutional lawyer who wants to unite Americans and become their president. Instead they fear that he is, at the very least, a deceptive elitist intellectual, or, at worst, he is the Indonesian candidate – an Islamic Jihadist who has for his entire adult life cultivated a fraudulent identity. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., had a similar identity problem, in the sense that he presented himself as an articulate, highly-educated black religious leader seeking to transcend racial boundaries; yet he was seen by many whites as a black militant seeking to stir up racial antagonism and violence. From the perspective of history, we can see that the former identity was much closer to reality than the former, but Taylor Branch’s account reminds readers of how unpopular and even hated King was at the time of his death.

King had a clear sense of his own identity, but even today he is often viewed in terms that distort his essential identity, as when he is described as a black civil rights leader. King insisted instead that he was basically something else, as when he said, “In the quiet recesses of my heart, I am fundamentally a clergyman, a Baptist preacher. This is my being and my heritage for I am also the son of a Baptist preacher, the grandson of a Baptist preacher and the great-grandson of a Baptist preacher.” He found it hard to convince people that his religious identity was what gave coherence to all his other identities and shaped his convictions about everything, including civil rights issues.

When King broke with President Johnson over the Vietnam, King responded to his many critics who questioned why he, a civil rights leader, was speaking out on the nation’s foreign policies. “When I hear them,” he said, “though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling.” He explained that, to him, the relationship of his ministry “to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I am speaking against the war.”

To say that King was basically a Baptist preacher does not resolve the question of who he was, because he himself realized that his religious identity was complex and unconventional – on the one hand, a mixture of strongly-held, enduring convictions about social gospel Christianity, and, on the other hand, persistent, troubling theological and personal doubts that were clarified but not resolved through his years of seminary training and his years as a graduate student in systematic theology. His real identity, like that of Obama and like that of many of us, contained within it conflicting identities that constantly contended for control of the direction of his life.

Like Obama and Mahandas Gandhi, whose own autobiography is a model of self-reflection about internal conflicts, King wrote candidly about the conflicts that shaped his adult identity. For King, the struggle moved from matters of religious orthodoxy and doubt to a more lasting struggle between his optimism about the ultimate triumph of good and his awareness of the power, ubiquity, and resilience of evil.

At his worst, King vacillated when others challenged him to act and compromised when others remained resolute. At his best, King returned again and again to the root of his identity as a social gospel preacher. He thereby reaffirmed his basic convictions even at the risk of his reputation, his stature as a civil rights leader, and even, as in his decision to come to Memphis forty years ago, at the risk of his life.

King was aware that the ultimately question of identity, is to find something that you value so much in yourself that you are willing to risk everything. Near the end of his life, he reflected, “If you have never found something so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren’t fit to live. You may be thirty-eight years old, as I happen to be, and one day, some great opportunity stands before you and calls upon you to stand up for some great principle, some great issue, some great cause. And you refused to do it because you are afraid. You refuse to do it because to want to live longer. . . . So you refuse to take the stand. Well, you may go on and live until you are ninety, but you are just as dead at thirty-eight as you would be at ninety. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. Take a stand for that which is right, and the world may misunderstand you, may criticize you. But you never go alone, for somewhere I read that one with God is a majority, and God has a way of transforming a minority into a majority.”

I don’t want to end with the discouraging notion that contradictions with one’s identity during one’s twenties might end with a valiant but lonely demise before the age of forty. After all, we also realize that one young man’s early struggles with identity might have prepared him for the presidency by age fifty. As I said at the start, my advice is a mixture of finger food and protein, and these can be nutritiously mixed together. So as my final thought, I urge you to go soon to Hawaii and call it work. Tell people that you have to read a three volume history of the United States because it is vital for your professional development. And after reading these volumes, you should plan to sit quietly on a gorgeous beach at sunset. And, after thinking about how lucky you are to be you, ask yourself, Who am I, really? 

On behalf of the class of 2008, I would like to extend a warm welcome to families, friends, the honorees, faculty, staff and administration. 

I would like to start off by thanking some very special individuals who have put in endless amounts of hours and work into our class. These extraordinary people have worked behind the scenes throughout our last four years. These individuals have made our years the success they have been. Without their commitment and dedication to our school we would not be sitting here today. A very special thank you to Father Levesque, Dr. Bonnie Rose, Brother Martin (Schneider), Rhonda Shiah, Mati Ortiz, Bill Newton, Ellen Batrouny, Sheila Hausrath, and Monica Saltarelli. 

I would next like to thank some of our fellow students whose talent have brought our class together over the past four years. Thank you to the senior delegates…Emily Smaldino, Nicole Alico, Kaylin Ranagan, Kelly Keroack, Dave Fitzpatrick, Dan Burger, Amanda Townsend, Jess Platt, Liz Campbell, Liz McColgin and Marisa Giambanco who have put in hours upon hours to guarantee our senior class an undergraduate career to remember.
 
Now, on behalf of the entire class of 2008 we would like to thank you, the families and friends for your unending love and support. Without your guidance, encouragement, and for many of us your financial assistance we would not be sitting here as graduates today. I am sure it was hard to watch us grow up, but its goes without saying that you are the ones who have shaped who we are today.  

And now to the graduates of the class of 2008… We sit here with a diploma in one hand and scratching our head with another trying to figure out where the time has gone. It may seem like yesterday where we sat, sweating, in the upstairs Gallagher gym reciting the NU creed. In a blink of an eye we are quickly seated back down together. This time, not as high school graduates. Not even as theater students, ROTC members, student government delegates, athletes, sororities, fraternities, commuters, or anything else you may have been involved in. We are sitting together, at this very moment, all collaboratively as Niagara University Alumni. We are about to enter a world as mature, wise individuals. A world that is known to be challenging in many aspects. However, we are at the advantage. We are entering with an education that makes a difference. On top of that, we are entering with the necessary attributes and Vincentian values that will help us succeed. 

Like the hit TV show “Cheers,” at Niagara everyone knows your name. And although our school is small in size, it is not small in heart. Niagara is not just a school we have attended for our undergraduate studies; many of us have found a second home. All of us have brought something to our school to make our success and experiences even greater. 

I believe that our lives can relate to an hourglass. We all went through the years of high school and the hourglass ran out. It was time to flip it over and begin our undergraduate career at Niagara. The sand began to drop slowly, but now it is again time to flip it back over. We are starting a new chapter of our lives, and although we will not forget our past the next hourglass is ready to begin. Wherever you may be going, and whatever path you may be beginning, I wish you the very best of luck.

Graduation is a time for us to celebrate our achievements, but do not stop there. Once this is all said and done, it is up to you to reach beyond what you have achieved and continue living life to its fullest. So, to the class of 2008…we did it. Never stop reaching for your dreams, believe in yourself, and love what you do. Thank you.

Lastly, it is a tradition that the senior class gives a gift to the school after graduation. It is with great honor to say that we are the first class to ever present our gift here at this ceremony. So on behalf of the entire class of 2008 we would like to give a monetary gift of $2,008 to the student center. A plaque will be placed in the Gallagher center so when you come back in 5, 10, even 20 years, you will be able to proudly know that you, the class of 2008, were a part of the new remodeling. 


You are our hope. So cherish this time in your life. Remember who you are. Because, right now, you have it all: The power of your imagination, the velocity of your dreams, the language of innocence, and the passion of a beginner. Don't lose it. Don't let it evaporate or get stripped away or worn away. And, as time passes, if you find you've come far away from yourself, allow the breeze of humility to remind you of who you were—who you really are.

Henry James said, "To live is such an art..."

If, from my vantage point now, I could tell my 22-year-old self what I now believe is the most important thing in life (and one I didn't embrace fully at the time because I was young and willful and reckless), it would be—to be present. I would encourage you, with all my heart, just to be present. Be present and open to the moment that is unfolding before you. Because, ultimately, your life is made up of moments. So don't miss them by being lost in the past or anticipating the future. Don't be absent from your own life.

You will find that life is not governed by will or intention. It is ultimately the collection of these sense memories stored in our nerves, built up in our cells. Simple things:

A certain slant of light coming through a window on a winter's afternoon
The sound of spring peepers at twilight
The taste of a strawberry still warm from the sun
Your child's laughter
Your mother's voice
These are the things that shape our lives and settle into the fiber of our beings. Don't take them for granted. Slow down for them, they will take root. And someday 20-30-40 years from now, you may be going about your day when by chance the smell of bread baking or the sound of a mockingbird singing will stop you in your tracks and carry you heart and soul back to yourself. Moments of pure happiness, bliss—if you feel comfortable using that word—come upon you unexpectedly. Don't be too preoccupied to experience them.

We need to slow it all down. I wonder sometimes why we can't just sit and do nothing. Why can't we enjoy idleness—the art of doing nothing. Perhaps it's not in our cultural DNA. We are goal oriented, result driven. Success is measured in how much we can get done.

We seem to have no time for stillness. What is this desperate need we have to fill the emptiness with iPods, Blackberries, cell phones, computers, video games, and television? Perhaps we should ask ourselves, how do we really understand pleasure and happiness? The Tibetan Buddhists have a saying, "Tomorrow or the next life—which comes first, we never know."

So I encourage you—don't keep anticipating that your life is up ahead of you. Don't always be waiting for the next thing. Don't put all your energies into some idea of the future. And with that in mind, you open the door to endless possibilities. Just allow life to take you on an adventure. Be receptive to the winds of change.

I graduated from high school in a worn-out little mill town in Northern Minnesota. Art was going to be my way out. I went to the University on a scholarship and entered the fine arts program. I imagined I would study—get my B.F.A., go on to get an M.F.A. Devote my life to painting. Then the second quarter of my freshman year the drawing class I wanted was filled. At the last minute I signed up for a photography class. My photography instructor introduced me to his friends, young photographers. They were leaving for Spain to make a documentary about flamenco Gypsies in Andalusia. And they asked me, did I want to come along? Yes, I said.

We lived in Europe for that year. When we returned to the States, we settled in New York. The early SoHo days. They had a friend they introduced me to—a modern dancer from the Merce Cunningham Company—who was starting an experimental theater company. She asked me if I wanted to dance with them. I said yes.

A man who had worked with the great mime master, Etienne Decroux, was in New York and came to give us classes. I fell in love with mime and when I learned Decroux still lived and taught in Paris, I decided to go study with him. With $100 in my pocket, I went to look for this old man. I lived in Paris for the next three years taking classes.

I felt I had finally settled in. I never imagined leaving Paris. At the school, I met some actors from New York. On a return visit to the States I ran into one of them. He asked if I wanted to come along to one of his acting classes to see what it was all about. "Yeah, yeah, why not?" I wasn't doing anything. I discovered an immediate passion for acting. It seemed to bring everything together for me. I decided to stay and study.

Suddenly, my life was in New York, working as a waitress and taking acting classes. I imagined it would be a long and steady process. I'd start auditioning, first for showcase theaters, then Off-Off-Broadway—work my way up until, finally, someday, maybe Broadway.

Then, one day, I was asked if I wanted to audition for a film. I would have to fly to Hollywood to do a screen test. It was like something out of an old movie. I didn't want to do film—my life was supposed to be in the theater. But it was winter in New York, I was broke, and my sister was sailing up the coast from Mexico and would be in California—I wanted to go see her. So I said, "yeah, why not? I've got nothing to lose."

They picked me up from my fifth floor walk-up in the Village, flew me to Los Angeles, and took me to MGM to do a screen test. I did it and they gave me the part. And so began a new and totally unexpected chapter in my life.

So, I guess the point I want to make is this—there was no way I could have ever anticipated or planned the twists and turns my life took in those six short years. Sometimes, you just have to let life take you on its glorious journey. And the best time to do it is now—when you're young and full of curiosity and have no fear. Don't constrain yourself with expectations of success. Success will be a by-product of the life you lead. All success is individual, and sometimes, as in my case, completely accidental.

So today you are setting off on your next adventure. You are beginning, and what makes beginnings so thrilling is the unknown. What is vital is this initial confrontation with the unknown and how you decide to embrace it. The world is waiting for you. Explore it through your own humanity. Be guided by your higher self. Don't be dissuaded or discouraged, but do allow yourself to be sidetracked if that's what you want. Get off the fast track, off the grid—go out and wander.

I hope that you will commit yourselves to the pursuit of peace—to the practice of tolerance and compassion. And be good stewards to our precious Earth. I wish you all the courage to have an adventurer's heart and a life lived in the moment.



President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, proud parents, and, above all, graduates.

The first thing I would like to say is ‘thank you.’ Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honor, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and convince myself that I am at the world’s largest Gryffindor reunion.
Delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility; or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation. The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one, because it turns out that I can’t remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard.

You see? If all you remember in years to come is the ‘gay wizard’ joke, I’ve come out ahead of Baroness Mary Warnock. Achievable goals: the first step to self improvement.

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called ‘real life’, I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

These may seem quixotic or paradoxical choices, but please bear with me.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension. I know that the irony strikes with the force of a cartoon anvil, now.

So they hoped that I would take a vocational degree; I wanted to study English Literature. A compromise was reached that in retrospect satisfied nobody, and I went up to study Modern Languages. Hardly had my parents’ car rounded the corner at the end of the road than I ditched German and scuttled off down the Classics corridor.

I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. Of all the subjects on this planet, I think they would have been hard put to name one less useful than Greek mythology when it came to securing the keys to an executive bathroom.

I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. What is more, I cannot criticize my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticized only by fools.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.

At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known hardship or heartbreak. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person’s idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.
So given a Time Turner, I would tell my 21-year-old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check-list of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two. Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone’s total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.

Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Though I personally will defend the value of bedtime stories to my last gasp, I have learned to value imagination in a much broader sense. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International’s headquarters in London.

There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends. I read the testimony of torture victims and saw pictures of their injuries. I opened handwritten, eye-witness accounts of summary trials and executions, of kidnappings and rapes.

Many of my co-workers were ex-political prisoners, people who had been displaced from their homes, or fled into exile, because they had the temerity to speak against their governments. Visitors to our offices included those who had come to give information, or to try and find out what had happened to those they had left behind.

I shall never forget the African torture victim, a young man no older than I was at the time, who had become mentally ill after all he had endured in his homeland. He trembled uncontrollably as he spoke into a video camera about the brutality inflicted upon him. He was a foot taller than I was, and seemed as fragile as a child. I was given the job of escorting him back to the Underground Station afterwards, and this man whose life had been shattered by cruelty took my hand with exquisite courtesy, and wished me future happiness.

And as long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing, from behind a closed door, a scream of pain and horror such as I have never heard since. The door opened, and the researcher poked out her head and told me to run and make a hot drink for the young man sitting with her. She had just had to give him the news that in retaliation for his own outspokenness against his country’s regime, his mother had been seized and executed.

Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone.

Every day, I saw more evidence about the evils humankind will inflict on their fellow humans, to gain or maintain power. I began to have nightmares, literal nightmares, about some of the things I saw, heard, and read.

And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.

Amnesty mobilizes thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet. My small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life.

Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people’s places.

Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathize.

And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages; they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.

I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way, except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do. Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid.

What is more, those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.

One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

That is an astonishing statement and yet proven a thousand times every day of our lives. It expresses, in part, our inescapable connection with the outside world, the fact that we touch other people’s lives simply by existing.

But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people’s lives? Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities. Even your nationality sets you apart. The great majority of you belong to the world’s only remaining superpower. The way you vote, the way you live, the way you protest, the pressure you bring to bear on your government, has an impact way beyond your borders. That is your privilege, and your burden.

If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.

I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life. They are my children’s godparents, the people to whom I’ve been able to turn in times of trouble, people who have been kind enough not to sue me when I took their names for Death Eaters. At our graduation we were bound by enormous affection, by our shared experience of a time that could never come again, and, of course, by the knowledge that we held certain photographic evidence that would be exceptionally valuable if any of us ran for Prime Minister.

So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom:
As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

I wish you all very good lives.

Thank-you very much.

I want to begin by thanking Bentley College’s President, Gloria Larson, for inviting me to be with you today and for Professor Rajendra Sisodia for recommending me as a speaker to President Larson. It is a great honor to be with all of you on this special occasion. I want to congratulate all of the students who are graduating. You have all accomplished something that I never have accomplished in my own life—finishing college. In the early 1970’s I attended two universities in Texas, Trinity in San Antonio and the University of Texas in Austin. I dropped in and out of these two schools a half dozen times over a 6 year period, piling up about 120 hours in various electives. I only took classes I was interested in, primarily philosophy, religion, and the humanities. To be perfectly honest with you, I spent my late teens and very early twenties primarily trying to figure out the meaning of life, or at least the meaning of my own life. I never took any business classes in school and if someone had told me back then that I was going to become a business entrepreneur when I was 24 and start my own business I would have laughed them out of the room.

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to discover the meaning of my life in college and I dropped out for the final time in 1977. My parents, especially my mother were very disappointed in me, but I had dropped out so many times before that they still had hope that I would eventually return and finish and make something worthwhile of my life.

In 1987, just before my mother passed away, it was her dying wish that I get a college degree, because she was still deeply concerned that without that college degree I would probably not have much success in life. At that time Whole Foods was still a very small company with only 5 stores and I felt badly about not being able to reassure her. However, I was doing something that I felt great passion about and know that I made the right decision for myself.

It has taken me 37 years but, Mom & Dad—I finally have that college degree that you wanted me to get so badly! And because it always meant so much to you, with love and respect I dedicate this degree to you and only wish you both could have lived long enough to be with me here today. Thank you Bentley College for fulfilling my mother’s last wish for me.

My first message to the Bentley students today then is to truly honor and appreciate your parents. No one will ever love you quite like your parents do, and although they have no doubt made plenty of mistakes in helping you to grow up, they’ve also done the very best job that they knew how to do. They’ve also made far more sacrifices on your behalf than you will ever really know. Please forgive them for their mistakes and imperfections and fully love them and honor them while you can, because the simple truth is that you won’t always have them with you as you move further along your life journey.

Hopefully many of the parents here today are feeling pretty good about me right now because my next message is one that can be a little bit scary to some people. However, it is also the major pearl of wisdom that I have to share today. The fact of the matter is that life is really very short and death is absolutely certain for all of us. It really is true that none of us are getting out of here alive and we should never forget this fundamental existential truth. Since death is real and inevitable for all of us, how then should we live our lives? For me the answer to this question has been clear since I was young: We should commit ourselves to following our hearts and doing what we most love and what we most want to do in life. This is how I’ve tried to lead my own life since I was about 19 years old. My decision to not finish college, but to start Whole Foods Market instead, was a decision that came from my heart. Although this decision proved to be upsetting for my parents and for many of my friends, for me it was absolutely the right decision.

Now that you’ve graduated from college and are about to launch yourselves in new directions, it is absolutely essential that you ask yourself what it is that you really care the most about? What are your passions? What are your deepest yearnings? If you could do absolutely anything in the world, what is it that you would do? Your heart knows the answers to these questions. It is whispering to you right now this very moment even as I speak these words to you. So listen to it and follow it. It will always be your best guide in life.

There are two important aspects to following your heart. First, we need to develop our self-awareness skills so that we can know when we are truly following our hearts and when we’ve lost our way. It is actually easier than it sounds because when we are truly following our hearts we are tapped into our deepest passions in life. We are doing what we most love and we find our lives full of increased energy, greater creativity, purpose, joy, and happiness. We simply feel more alive and we are moving within the flow of life. How do you know when you’ve stopped following your heart? When the opposite occurs—decreased energy, lack of creativity, no real sense of purpose and you aren’t particularly happy. You have stepped out of the flow of life and are just drifting along. When this happens the solution is simple: Choose again. Reconnect again with your heart. As long as you are alive, it is never too late. You are free in each moment to choose the path of your heart and it never stops whispering to you, urging you to follow it.

The second key to successfully following your heart is that you will need to learn how to deal with fear. It is fear which prevents most people from reaching their fullest potential in life—fear of failure, fear of rejection from people we care about, fear that we simply aren’t good enough, and sometimes even fear of our own potential greatness. Unfortunately no one else can overcome fear for us. Fear is something that you must learn to master on your own. Of course courage is the major strategy for learning to master fear for most people and we should certainly develop courage to the greatest extent we are able to. However, for me the insight that has personally helped me the most when dealing with fear has been to understand that fear is primarily a creation of the mind. I create it in my mind—it doesn’t really exist outside the mind. I can dissolve it there as well. So can you and you will need to learn how to do this if you really want to be free in life and stay connected to your heart.

My third message to the Bentley graduates today is to emphasize the absolute importance of love as the cardinal virtue to nurture and cultivate in your lives. I don’t believe there is anything more important in life than love. I’m not talking about romantic love here, or “eros”, which is a very wonderful state of intoxication, but which also tends to fade over time. Rather, I’m talking about love as care and compassion, which actively flows out of our hearts toward other people and sentient beings through empathy and appreciation. This type of love need not fade over time, but is capable of continued growth all our lives if we will consciously nurture it. When we are truly following our hearts we are very likely tapped into the flow of love as well. But love is also a virtue that we can consciously develop in our lives to higher and higher levels. Such efforts are well worth making for nothing enriches us, teaches us, or makes life more rewarding than developing our capacity for love. In cultivating love in my own life I’ve found practicing three other related virtues to be essential.

First is gratitude. Being alive is absolutely extraordinary and there are endless things to be thankful and grateful for. I try to take a few minutes early in the morning to be very quiet and to appreciate the people I love and to express gratitude in my heart for the many wonderful things that fill my life with joy. At Whole Foods we practice appreciations at the end of all of our meetings, including even our Board Meetings—voluntarily expressing gratitude and thanks to our co-workers for the thoughtful and helpful things they do for us. It would be hard to overestimate how powerful appreciations have been at Whole Foods as a transformational practice for releasing more love throughout the company. I enthusiastically recommend you try it in your own organizations and your future workplaces.

Second is forgiveness. Nothing stops the flow of love in our lives quicker than the various judgments we make toward others and the grievances that we allow to fester in our minds against other people. What we don’t fully understand is how much we harm ourselves with our judgments and grievances, because if we did understand we would stop indulging ourselves with them. Instead, we would see them for the poisons that they truly are. Fortunately, there is one virtue that we can practice that will eliminate them from our minds—forgiveness. Practicing forgiveness isn’t always easy, however. Our desire to be “right” is very strong and this usually requires us to judge others as “wrong”, and therefore not really forgivable. We also frequently make the mistake of believing that if we forgive others we are also condoning their harmful behavior. However, forgiveness simply means to relinquish our resentment and anger toward others, it doesn’t mean relinquishing our values and ethics. When we forgive others we free ourselves from the past and allow our hearts to be fully in the present moment, which is where love exists.

Third is generosity. It would be difficult to exaggerate the value of practicing generosity. The virtue of generosity does not merely apply to giving money, but primarily to the gift of ourselves—our time and our service to others. True generosity should not be thought of as some kind of self-sacrifice where what we give to others comes at our own expense—their gain is our loss. Rather it is an extension of love from our own hearts, which takes genuine delight in the flourishing of other people. In my life experience generosity is a virtue that is best cultivated at first with small steps—acts of giving and kindness that may stretch us a bit, but which do not feel like any kind of sacrifice. As we practice generosity over time we will gradually discover that we want to take larger steps and extend our generosity further, because our sense of who we are and what we care about has expanded as well.

My fourth message to the Bentley graduates today is that life has many, many difficulties and challenges—it isn’t easy. We all will face many disappointments, frustrations, losses, and injustices, as well as inevitable illness, aging, and eventually death. I believe the best way to deal with most of the difficulties and challenges that come our way are to see them as opportunities to help us grow—lessons that are presented to us to help us go further than we have gone before. I have not found it to be useful to ever see myself as a victim of either circumstances or of other people. Self-pity is a remarkably self-destructive emotion, which you should consciously work to eliminate from your emotional life because it dis-empowers you and moves you away from being able to follow your heart.

I have been particularly challenged over the past year. I’ve seen the Federal Trade Commission accuse Whole Foods of being a monopoly and try unsuccessfully to break up our merger with Wild Oats, been heavily criticized in the media for internet postings I did on Yahoo! about Whole Foods and Wild Oats, been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning those same internet postings, and fought a proxy battle against activists who sought to remove me from both the Whole Foods Board of Directors and as the Chairman of the Board. I’ve seen an amazing number of negative articles written about me with remarkably inaccurate stories and outright lies being told. Perhaps the hardest thing of all was that I was unable to respond to any of these attacks as the Whole Foods Board imposed complete media and blog silence on me while their own Special Investigation and the SEC Investigation were taking place. I was not able to defend myself publicly in any way and therefore had no way to try to set the record straight.

It was a pretty difficult time for me. Many times I was tempted to lash out in anger at the injustice of the situation and self-pity was frequently a temptation that I had to struggle with. I did a tremendous amount of personal growth work such as counseling, meditation, and integrated breath work to try to appreciate and to understand what the lessons life was trying to teach me were. There were many. One very difficult lesson for me was to learn that I had to simply let go and trust the process that was happening, because I certainly couldn’t control it or stop it. That is not my natural inclination because I prefer to directly confront my challenges. A second lesson I learned was that a lot of people really do care about me and they provided amazing emotional support to me—that was pretty humbling for me and something that I am deeply grateful about. My most valuable lesson, however, has been about the importance of communicating with greater thoughtfulness and sensitivity. I believe that I’ve always lived my life with a passion for honesty—tell the truth as I saw it regardless of how that truth would be interpreted by others. I have always thought that there was far too little honesty and far too many lies in the world. While I still believe that, I’ve now come to realize how easy it is to be misunderstood and misinterpreted. A careless and thoughtless statement may be taken out of context and repeated over and over again—literally sent around the world through digital media. I saw this happen many times over the past year and it has burned itself into my consciousness.

I now apply a couple of very simple rules to everything that I say, write, or do:

How will this either help or hurt the fulfillment of my own deeper purpose in life, especially its impact on Whole Foods Market?
How would I feel if that was printed on the front page of the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times—because it just might be? If I feel good about the possibility of everyone knowing about it then it is o.k. However, if I would feel embarrassed or ashamed, then I’m going to have to change it. This has been a subtle lesson for me about the refinement of motivation and purpose and it has taken me many years to learn it. If you are able to learn it while you are young you may be able to avoid a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering.

My final message to the Bentley graduates today has to do with the type of business organizations that we need to create in the 21st century. I believe that the 20th century will eventually be seen by historians as the great contest between capitalism and socialism with capitalism scoring a decisive victory. Capitalism may have won the war, but it has not captured the hearts of the people. Most people don’t love or trust corporations, who they often see as uncaring, greedy, selfish, dishonest, and concerned only with maximizing profits. I believe that what the world needs now is the widespread creation of a different type of business organization, one that is a “Conscious Business.” A Conscious Business is one which has two major attributes that define it:

It has a deeper purpose beyond only making profits. Just like individual people by following their hearts can discover their own sense of deeper purpose, so can the business enterprise. I believe that great businesses have great purposes that inspire them to higher levels of success. Think for a moment about some of the greatest businesses in the world and ask yourself whether they exist to fulfill a greater purpose beyond only maximizing profits. Certainly Apple does, driven by its intense desire to create “insanely great” technology which transforms our lives in positive ways. Clearly Google does too with its passion for discovery and desire to operate an ethical company. One of the best examples in the world is Grameen Bank in Bangladesh founded by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammed Yunus, which exists to end poverty in Bangladesh and throughout the world. Every business has the potential to discover and actualize its higher purpose—it has the potential to become more conscious.

The Conscious Business also understands the interdependency of all of the major stakeholder groups—customers, employees, investors, suppliers, communities, and the environment—and the business is managed to consciously create value for all of these major stakeholders. Instead of viewing the stakeholders in terms of win-lose relationships with conflicts of interest dominating their interactions, the Conscious Business understands that there is a harmony of interests between the stakeholder groups and that by working together greater value can be created for all of them. At Whole Foods we understand that management’s most important job is to make sure the team members are well trained and happy at their work. The team members in turn understand that their job is to satisfy and delight the customers and happy customers result in happy investors through the prosperity of the business. A virtuous circle is created with all of the stakeholders flourishing together.

Who will create the Conscious Businesses of the 21st century—businesses that have deeper purpose and are managed consciously to create value on behalf of all of the stakeholders? Why not some of the Bentley graduates here today? Why not you?

I have personally found nothing more fun, more meaningful, or more rewarding than creating and growing Whole Foods Market. It was what my heart called me to do and I have followed that calling for 30 years now. To the Bentley graduates today I put forth this challenge: what is your own heart calling you to do? Whatever it is, have the courage to follow it. The grand adventure of your own life now lies open before you. Seize the Day! Thank you. I have greatly enjoyed being with you today.

Mr. President, Trustees, Overseers, faculty, administrators, families, friends, fellow members of Red Sox Nation, and above all, the great Class of 2008:

First, let me thank President Brown for that gracious introduction and welcome. And my thanks to the Trustees for their kind invitation to speak today. As a proud, new son of Boston and a neighbor from down the street, I am well aware of the world-class caliber, the long and inspiring tradition, the prestigious faculty, the enriching diversity, and the gifted student body of Boston University. It’s a great honor to be your commencement speaker, and, on this happy day, I offer my congratulations, and those of the Boston Red Sox, to the Class of 2008.

And it is humbling to receive an honorary BU degree in the company of:

– A legendary tennis player who has devoted her life to gender equality;

– A brilliant industrialist who has dressed several generations and transformed retailing;

– A life-giving doctor who found time to deliver over 8,000 babies and to create a mentoring program for African Americans;

– The generous philanthropist, who has given for decades, his time, his treasury and his heart, to his alma mater.

Congratulations to you all.

Now I know you hoped for a Commencement speaker beloved in Boston – a man known for his popularity, character, and grace under pressure. Unfortunately, Big Papi couldn’t make it. I confess at the outset that I am a near rookie at this. I come, after all, from the world of sports, which I am aware has been referred to as the “toy department of life.” But I do know enough to know the most important thing about a commencement address: be brief! After you’ve worked, studied, struggled for so many years, now comes the hard part: listening to a commencement address. One friend who has given about a zillion commencement speeches gave me some great advice: “Larry, keep it short and let them go party. They’re not gonna listen to you anyway.”

I know my selection is a reflection of the close and historic bonds between BU and the Red Sox:

– We share an urban neighborhood in the heart of a great Boston;

– We share a commitment to serve this city;

– We rely on each other to preserve and improve our local ecosystem;

– We are gathered in a former ballpark built by the same architect who designed Fenway Park;

– And, we have shared memories.

Harry Agganis, one of BU’s most legendary athletes, starred in Terrier football, basketball, and baseball, and went on to play for the Red Sox. Legend has it that during his rookie season in 1954, Agganis hit a home run at Fenway Park, then made his way up Commonwealth Avenue to receive his diploma.

Perhaps most memorably, the Boston University Class of 2008 as freshmen and as seniors helped propel the Red Sox to two World Series Championships in your four years here in town. Unprecedented! Causation or correlation, your professors may ask. We know you guys helped make it happen.

The Boston Red Sox thank you, Boston University and we thank you, Class of 2008, for what you’ve done for us.

Now, my role today is to share a few insights, and offer a bit of advice to you young men and women as you go out into the hard, cold world. Some points aren’t original with me, and you can be sure a baseball executive doesn’t have all of the answers, but I hope to offer suggestions that may be helpful to someone – sometime, somehow, somewhere – along the way.

Let me start with a personal note that is a bit embarrassing. Not long after I completed law school, I kept – enlarged, framed, and posted proudly in my office – a passage written by Brendan Gill, a writer and critic for The New Yorker magazine. He wrote it as encouragement for the young, who, even in the easy-going 1970s, were hearing, in Mr. Gill’s opinion, far too much about what a serious matter life was.

According to Mr. Gill (and my office wall), I quote: “Not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the argument that life is serious, though it is often hard and even terrible. And saying that, I am prompted to add what follows out of it: that since everything ends badly for us, in the inescapable catastrophe of death, it seems obvious that the first rule of life is to have a good time and that the second rule of life is to hurt as few people as possible. There is no third rule.”

For years, I did not doubt this quotation. I have since grasped how limited and even misleading that clever passage really is.

Rules for living, Mr. Gill, don’t stop there. A glib, hedonistic creed is inadequate. So, after three unexpected decades as a baseball executive, and after several decades of errors, missteps, and regrets, I instead offer my personal “Top Ten List,” in no particular order: my list of some of the lessons that life and the world of sports have tried their best to teach me.

Number 10: Give a nod to Mr. Gill. Of course, it is true that life must be fun; also, that kindness is essential – and you do need to work at both. Mr. Gill wasn’t entirely wrong, just terribly incomplete.

Number 9: Be bold – do be prudent – but please take risks, in your personal life, in your career, in your travels, in your geographical choices.

It was probably bold to assume we could move to Boston and acquire the storied Red Sox franchise in 2001.

It was bold to disregard the conventional wisdom that Fenway Park could not and should not be saved.

It was bold to conclude that even a gifted 28-year-old could quickly become a successful general manager – but perhaps not really that risky since he is the son of a distinguished professor and chair of the Creative Writing Department here at Boston University!

In one of my favorite Meryl Streep movies, Defending Your Life, the main character is challenged for a lifetime of caution and timidity: “Fear is like a giant fog. It sits on your brain and blocks everything. Real feeling, true happiness, real joy, they can’t get through that fog. But if you lift it, then buddy, you’re in for the ride of your life.”

So be sure to take some risks. A student once told a commencement speaker that college was a great place to learn about risk-taking. The speaker asked what he meant. The student replied: “Have you ever tasted the dining hall food here?”

Yes, be bold – and be sure you let yourself dream.

Former major leaguer Graig Nettles once said: “When I was a little boy, I dreamed I would be a baseball player and join the circus. With the Yankees, I’ve accomplished both.”

Number 8: Smile, laugh, and be pleasant. This may sound banal and naïve. It is not. It is a profound occupational and personal advantage. Let me quote Elwood P. Dowd, the central character in the unforgettable Jimmy Stewart film Harvey – a man with whom I have come to agree. Quote: “My mother used to say to me, ‘Elwood, in this world you must be oh-so clever, or oh-so pleasant.’ For 40 years I tried clever. I recommend pleasant.”

Number 7: Be strong enough to say, “I don’t know.” When you don’t know or understand something – and such a time may come even after the superior education you have received at BU – when you don’t know, say so. Don’t guess. Don’t fake it. One day at Yale Law School I tried to sling an answer. My distinguished old professor then said, “That is a wonderful answer, Mr. Lucchino. Thank you. It is wonderful because it could not be more wrong, so it is pedagogically very useful to us.” If you don’t have the answer, say so. These seven words often work out well: “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.” You won’t mislead your colleagues, and people will respect your honesty and self-assurance.

Number 6: Remember: life is too hard to be lived alone. Find time for your family. You only get one. “Thank God,” I can hear some of you saying out there.

And, a family of your own will change the way you look at life, at your parents, at your grandparents. “Oh, now I get it,” you’ll say. So, put simply, call home; call your parents, but especially call your mother! And remember, texting doesn’t count. And check in with your grandparents, often the most loyal, loving and supportive people you will ever have in your life.

Ponder this riddle: Why do grandparents and grandchildren get along so well? The answer – and I say it light-heartedly: Because they have an enemy in common.

May I ask the graduates to join me in thanking their parents, their grandparents, their caregivers – those people who made today possible – the people on whose shoulders you stand.

And work at friendship. Develop a talent for friendship. Friends fill a life; they represent perhaps the purest choices you ever make in life.

And, if you work at it and are fortunate, the line between friend and family will become indistinct as you walk through life.

Number 5, which follows from Number 6: Reflect often upon the most important source of knowledge in your student years – your classmates. It’s from them that you have discovered other ways of looking at the world – other ways of living. Stay in touch with the people who matter to you – share one another’s lives. Through sharing one another’s sorrow, you will find life tolerable. Through sharing one another’s joys, you will enhance your life. Long after you have forgot the last fact you crammed for a final exam, remember a lesson learned from a friend or an insight from a classmate.

Who knows how your classmates’ lives will unfold? At my college graduation, the president of my university offered what turned out to be prescient advice as to college roles and those that come later. Quote: “Many of you lesser-known on campus will catapult to prominence in the years ahead, while others well-known to us here will gravitate to the periphery.” Those are wise words. Stay close to your friends here – whether or not fate smiles kindly upon them.

Number 4: Remember Jackie Robinson, although, believe it or not, many baseball players do not. Be mindful of the catalytic effect one person can have on a community, on a neighborhood, on a nation, on a compelling cause or a nagging injustice. Hold within yourself a capacity for outrage at injustice. Be confident that if you fight long enough and hard enough, you too can make a difference. And like Jackie Robinson, you can do it with dignity.

Number 3: Don’t be colorblind. Your world is indeed a rich, open, diverse, multi-colored, multi-ethnic, multi-textured, multi-cultural experience. Declaring that all groups are the same is a deceit; believing that some ethnic groups are better than others is a moral disgrace. Embrace and celebrate the pluralism and diversity that are the essence of American life, indeed the essence of all of life. We aren’t all the same, we shouldn’t try to be. Immerse yourself; enjoy our enriching differences. Opposites allegedly attract; they also educate.

Speaking of opposites, before I wrap up MY list, I want to share some famous advice the inimitable Yogi Berra himself has offered to graduates. Sorry; as a baseball executive, I couldn’t resist:

– During the years ahead, when you come to a fork in the road, take it.

– Don’t make too many wrong mistakes.

– Remember that whatever you do in life, 90 percent of it is half mental.

– Always go to other people’s funerals – otherwise they won’t go to yours.

Continuing with my own list:

Number 2: Seek balance. A rich life is a balanced life. Don’t focus too early on your career. Deviate a bit. Embrace change. A Yale professor of my era once preached: “Everything before age 30 was preface.” Widen your gaze. If you have blinders on, take them off. The world is open, and full of opportunity. And, pay attention to Sigmund Freud’s famous definition of mental health: “to work, to love, and to play well.” And mental health isn’t like baseball – one for three or a .333 batting average isn’t good enough.

Finally, Number 1: Help some people along the way. The famous French soldier and statesman, Marquis de Lafayette, wrote long ago of America: “What charms me most is that all of the citizens are brethren.” We are – and must still be – brethren. Find a cause you care about. Involve yourself. And start early in life. For me, a two-time cancer survivor, cancer research and patient treatment are at the top my priorities, and those of the ever-growing Red Sox Foundation.

Life is not about warming yourself by the fire, life is about building the fire. And generosity is the match. To consider yourself – and to be considered – capable is good. To consider yourself – and to be considered – loving is even better. But to know yourself as generous is best of all. Generosity is its own reward. There is a Chinese proverb that applies. (Isn’t there always?) Roughly it says that if you want happiness for an hour, take a nap, but if you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.

In closing, let me say that, if you will pardon the cliché, I was not born yesterday: I know the college years are not necessarily a period of pure and uninterrupted tranquility and bliss. You may well have experienced times of disappointment, of failure, of hurt, and of pain. I hope that you have known, even more, experiences of joy, of satisfying maturation, and of just plain, old fashioned fun. For you parents, there may well have been times of hardship and financial sacrifice. I hope that you too have had much satisfaction and justifiable feelings of great pride.

For graduates-to-be and family members, today is a day to focus on your triumph.

Congratulations to the Members of the Class of 2008. Thank your professors and your mentors. They have pointed the way to the doors: only you can choose the one through which to pass. Walk through it proudly, into the world with all of its uncertainty and all of its magnificent opportunity.

I congratulate you – and with great admiration – wish you long and rewarding lives. God bless you, and thank you very much.

Thank you President Bacow. Thank you to the faculty and fellow honorees, trustees, the alumni, friends, families, and graduates. This is very emotional. I realize if I were to apply here today, I would never get in.

So I’m really grateful to be invited back. I was invited to a dinner last night at the president’s house and I couldn’t go because I had an accident Friday on the Today show. We had New Kids on the Block performing and it was raining, the indignity of it all, and I fell on the stage and just took my shin off. I was lying in my hotel last night, at the Taj Mahal—the hotel, not the actual Taj Mahal. I was on drugs but I’m not delusional. And I had time with my leg up to think about how I got here today.

I don’t make speeches. Despite what I do for a living, I’m basically kind of shy. But about a little over a year ago, Larry, you know Larry, Larry called. We traded phone calls and I finally reached him and he was on his sailboat. He said to me, “Listen, I want you to give this speech in 2008.” And I had just started at the Today show and everything I read said the show is going to tank now that Katie was gone. I said, “Listen, Larry, I could really screw up my job and then you’re not going to want me here giving the commencement address. He sort of laughed and he said, “Don’t worry about it.” And then I said, “Plus, I don’t even know what I would say to these students.” He said, “Oh, you’ve got a year to think about it.” And then there must have been a gust of wind because his voice sort of trailed off and the last thing I heard him say was, “Speak from your heart, Meredith.”

So for the past year I’ve been trying to think of what I should say to you. Obviously I should try to inspire you or maybe alert you to some of the potholes along the way that you’re going to face. Or I could cut right to the chase and tell you the real story behind Barbara Walters and Star Jones. I know, I know. And I do know. Actually, you know what, I’m going to get to that, I am going to get to that.

But first—yeah—but first, as I look out over your faces, the graduates, I’m so impressed by the mission of this school to create real leaders. Back when I was here, I was a student here from 1971 to 1975, I’m going to be honest, I wasn’t much of a leader, except for January 1975, I led a group of female students across the campus streaking. Literally. Yeah. It was really cold, I remember that. And at one point, you know, I looked over my shoulder and the only behind I saw was mine. So as I was crouching in the bushes waiting for the campus police to drive by with the high beams on because, you know, got to catch these girls in the act, it struck me that every leader, no matter how small, occasionally will find themselves alone and exposed.

After that I did actually make a little bit more of myself, albeit with my clothes on—and quite frankly, I advise you do to the same, keep them on—to the point where nowadays, people your age often come up to me—we have a lot of interns at the Today show—and they’ll say, “How did you get where you are? What did you do? What is the formula for success?” I tell them all and I’ll tell you, the only formula is that there is no formula. There is no easy way to get from point A to point B, nor is there any right way. In fact, my career, if you want to talk about a fluke, I was the kid at Tufts University who went through every major. I came in as a math major. I moved from that to drama, to French, to astronomy. I was brought into the dean’s office who said, “Stop it, pick one.” The only one I could pick was English because that’s where I had enough credits. So I totally relate to the students out here, the graduates who might be a little scared right now. Maybe you don’t know where you’re headed. Maybe you haven’t found your passion. Maybe your parents are looking at you like, “What are you going to do?” and you’re scared. I felt all of that. I felt very lost.

And then, again in January—a lot happened in that January, I tell you, in 1975—I took a class here in broadcast journalism. It was pass/fail. I don’t even know why it took it. I had no interest, none. I didn’t see myself as a broadcaster in my future. I took this class. It was given by a reporter from CBS Radio in Boston, WEEI. Back then it was all news. I think maybe now it’s all sports but back then it was all news. And I found that I liked it. I really liked it. At the end, they had a final project. We were broken down into groups of four or five and we each had to do a mini radio documentary. We would research it, report it, write it, and then one person would narrate the documentary. I happened to be the one chosen to narrate ours. They brought in a muckety muck from CBS to critique it, a man named Bill Shermer, a wonderful man who has since passed on. He listens to all these documentaries and when ours comes up he says, “Whose voice is that?” I raise my hand and he says, “I want to see you after class.” I thought, “Oh my God, what’s going to happen?” I go out into the hallway and he says, “Have you decided what you want to do with the rest of your life?” Now being a Tufts student, I knew— philosophical deep question, ponder for a moment. And I did and then I said, “Gee, I don’t know.” He said, “Well, I do. I truly believe if you open up your mind you have a future in this business.” And he offered me an internship. And literally, that’s all it took. It was in that moment. It was one person seeing a spark in me and opening a door that I went through. It was that simple. Had I not taken that class, I don’t really know what direction. I would have found a direction, but that’s what put me on the path.

A few weeks later I learned something that is probably the first lesson I’m going to impart to you: remember to always ask questions. I’m an intern now, two weeks before I have to start. They give me a call and say, “You’re going to be ripping wires.” Okay, ripping wires. Radio station. Wires out of the walls. A little weird that they’d have me do that, but fine, I’ll do that. I went and I bought a new pair of overalls because I thought, “Gee, I’m going to look cute.” And actually that was the style back then. I show up to work at 4 a.m.—talk about ironies, I’m back on that schedule—I show up at WEEI and people are looking at me weird, like “Why are you dressed in overalls?” Finally it dawns on somebody about my confusion. Ripping wires, what they meant was ripping the wire services, the copy off of UPI, Reuters, AP, not wires out of the wall. Eventually they stop laughing, although if anybody that I knew back then sees me they always bring it up. I learned a lesson that day: no question is too stupid. You’re not as smart as you think you are. You never will be. There’s always room to learn. Don’t be scared to ask. Luckily for me Bill Shermer still took a chance on me, which I’m very grateful that he did.

But you’re going to find that in life, occasionally people will not be on your side. And then what do you do when you hit that first wall? Mine occurred about two years later. I had moved from radio to television, Providence, RI, and about a year into that job, and I felt pretty secure, I was brought in by the news director on a Friday, because that’s when they do it to you. And he said, “You know what, you don’t have what it takes.” And they let me go.

I grew up in Providence so I went home to my family home and I’m in my bedroom crying. My dad comes in and he says, “What’s the matter?” I told him and he said, “Well, do you think you have what it takes?” Even though I didn’t, I said, “Yeah. I think I do. And he said, “Why do you care what anybody’s going to say to you that would conflict with that feeling? You’re going to have naysayers, and I’ll tell you, you will throughout your life have people who will tell you're not good enough. Maybe they’re jealous. Maybe they think you aren’t. Maybe they’ve had a bad day. But ultimately you have to believe in yourself.” Based on that pep talk or maybe serious PMS, I did go in that Monday. I basically pinned him to the wall. You know and I think back on it and I said, “I don’t care what you think. I am going to make it.” I might have freaked him out, but he gave me a second chance. Since then, we have become very good friends. But I did learn a lesson about believing in yourself.

After that I was sort of on a fast track. I went from Providence directly to New York City at WCBS television and then onto network news. Some of you are going to find yourselves with that same trajectory because of the kind of students that you are. You’re going to move very fast and you’ll find that there isn’t a lot of time to pause and reflect. And I would urge you to do that. Sometimes you get on this high speed train and you never stop to think, “Well, where am I going and who am I? What am I really doing?” That’s when you’re tested at your core. Probably my biggest test came with 60 Minutes that Larry referred to.

Again, I was on this fast track and I was in West 57th, the magazine. I was also married but had several miscarriages and finally was pregnant with my first child after trying for quite a few years. I was leaving on maternity leave to have Ben, and I was brought into office of president of CBS News and he said to me, “How would you like to be a co-anchor, a co-editor at 60 Minutes”? And without thinking, I said yes, because it truly was the only job in the business that I ever really coveted. It was the perfect job for a reporter, the height of success. I went home that night and I had a really bad stomachache and I figured, well I am going to have a baby so maybe that’s what’s causing it. The following week I had Ben but I never got rid of the stomachache, it kept getting worse and worse.

Six months later I’m at 60 Minutes and I find that every time I’m on the road for a story, I’m having that pain thinking about my family and every time I’m with my family, I’m feeling guilty about my job and confused. Meanwhile, I became the media darling. There were all these stories, “Meredith Vieira, the woman who has it all. She’s got a husband, she’s got a kid, she’s got one of the best jobs in the business.” I just went along smiling and the whole thing even though inside I was churning. Then I got pregnant with second child, Gabriel, and I was brought into Don Hewitt’s office who was the head of 60 Minutes at the time and he said, “You know what? You’re going to have to make a choice here. What matters more to you? You going to go full-time with this and really commit to it or are you going to leave?” In that moment, I did what I urge all of you to do later than I should have. I listened to my gut and I said, “You know what, I’m out of here.” And I said it in a nice way. And that night for the first night in years, I really slept well.

A few days later I was at an event and a woman cornered me and she said, “You know what, I can’t believe that you’re doing this. This sends such a wrong message to women everywhere who really believe you can have it all. If you leave this job, you’re going to fail us all.” And I thought, “You know what, what is failure?” If I stayed, that would be failure. That would be sending out a message to people that is dishonest. I had to be true to myself, as hard as that was and as scary as that was, you’ve got to listen to the voice in your gut. It is individual. It is unique. It is yours. It’s called being authentic. There’s only one of you and maybe you’re not going to follow the path that other people would like to put you on, but that’s okay. You’re going to find the path that’s right for you. 
...
Ultimately, I’ve interviewed presidents and I’ve interviewed poor people just trying to make it—I actually prefer the latter group, to be honest with you—what I’ve found is that all of us need to connect, we need to reach out to each other. It is the greatest gift that you can give to anybody and ultimately the most important gift of all. You’re very special kids to be graduating from this school. I hope you know it. You’re here because you are leaders. You have a mission. You also have an internal compass in each and every one of you and I would urge you to listen to it. Follow that voice. Someone much smarter than me once said, “Don’t go with the flow. You are the flow.”

... that’s what life’s about, it’s about learning. Good luck, get out of here, and may you truly live every day of your life. Thank you. 

Steeler nation, where are you today? Alright.

I feel at home in more ways than one today.

President Reveley, Chancellor O'Connor, board, faculty staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, and most importantly, Class of 2008.

It's my honor and privilege to come and share this special day with you. It's a homecoming of sorts for me. For you see, 13 years ago, today, I sat where you sit. Somewhere in that area over there. I was. 

And unlike a lot of alums, I don't get a chance to come back home very often. So this is a very special day for me. Generally my duties don't allow me to come back for Homecomings in the fall… weekends. 

So as I walk around campus this weekend, and specifically this morning, take in some of the familiar sights and sounds that are our campus, I reminisce. I reflect, and it's awesome.

I think about the good, I think about the bad. I think about the countless hours at the library.. not the one on Richmond Road. Parents don't get that joke.

But Swem Library. I do know where the one on Richmond Road is, though. I hear it's a nice gathering place to study. 

And I feel very blessed to share the common bond that we all share. That a small piece of this place is home for all of us. And, as you go on the journey of life you'll realize the quality lessons that you learned here in the last four, and maybe some of you like me, five years.

But it is an honor, but also I view it as a task, one that I don't take lightly. You see I talk for a living. I give many, many speeches. But this one I am a little out of my lane, if you will. So, I thought long and hard about it. I speak extemporaneously usually, and I've discussed those issues with people that I respect. 

They asked to see my transcript, for what it is that I'm going to say to you today. I have no transcript. That's how I do it.

But I do take this very seriously and I have thought long and hard. I just got done with the NFL draft and I had the pleasure of interviewing 89 young people who were draft eligible. Many of which had their college degrees. And I asked those young men who spoke at their commencement ceremony and what did they say that was inspiring. You know my next line. They had no idea.

I mentioned earlier that I sat somewhere over there 13 years ago today about this time. I too have no idea what was said by my commencement speaker. Very comforting to me as I stand before you today. 

But the more I thought about the reason why I don't remember what was said, and the reason why those young men I interviewed prior to the NFL draft don't remember what was said is because I recognize that this is a very distracted group today. 

Not unlike my football team when I stand before them minutes before we burst open the lockerroom doors and take the field. See this is like a team here today, and those are the locker room doors. On the other side of those doors awaits the game of life.

I recognize the looks on the faces… excitement, worry, fear. Some people are just glad to be here. And they don't care what happens on the other side of those doors. In all of that is okay. My job and my goal here today is to provide that something that maybe a few of need. And the rest of you will just remember this as a great time. 

So here I go. In the vein of pre-game speeches I'm told I'm pretty good. But those people work for me and usually they lie. 

The message must be clear. There can be no misunderstanding. If we misunderstand jobs and assignments that await us on the other side of those doors, we lose in a loud and grotesque manner. People get hurt. And I say that with a smile. That's the game of life, like football. 

This message must be concise. Because unlike my football team, if I take too long, my team will run me over to take the field in the game of life.

The message must be meaty. It must be of substance. Because there are trials. There's adversity. On the other side of those doors.

Hopefully it inspires. It produces play that culminates in the desired outcome, which is, who are we kidding… victory.

Victory is spelled more than one way. Here it is. And it's simple.

First and foremost, I'd like to compliment this team on what they've done to sit here today. I don't take the preparation for granted. I've been where you are. I've understood the sacrifice.

I also understand that there were a lot of people that supported you, and made sacrifices for you to be here today. I'd like you to join me in thanking your support network. The people that made sacrifices, that readied you for today's game. 

Secondly, I'd like to encourage you. I'd like to encourage you to trust that preparation. As we say in our business, this group has got the goods. And when you've got the goods, it is man versus himself. Your opponent does not matter today, because you've got the goods. 

One of the things I do remember about sitting where you sit, is when we walk the grounds of this great college, we're told repeatedly that when we get re-released into the wild, we'll have the skills to win. I'm here to tell you today that that's very true. And it is not just in the field that I've chosen to pursue, but in every field of human endeavor.

Whatever it is that your heart desires for you to pursue, your experience here has sharpened your sword for battle. 

I encourage you today, to trust that preparation. 

Next, I'd like to reassure you. Like I do with my football team. You see, one of the things that happens in football is that when we go out those locker room doors, the first five minutes of action never decides the outcome of the game. 

This game, this game of life, is about sustaining, rebounding, responding. The breaks are the breaks. Some of you, you'll burst out the locker room today and you'll have great success. I challenge you. Don't wear your hand out patting yourself on the back.

There's always the next time the ball's going to snap, somebody is ready to knock you down. 

Some of you might burst out of these locker rooms today, and be on the short end some. The first five minutes of the game does not decide the outcome. As I sat out there 13 years ago, with some of my great friends, they were off to do really exciting things— Georgetown law, medical school, corporate America, Washington, D.C., townhouses and Adams Morgan. 

Me, I was going to earn $12,000 a year at Virginia Military Institute. So much for my first five minutes. It does not decide the outcome of the game.

I'd like to challenge this team. I'd like to challenge you to attack. To play to win if you will. Not only in terms of the scoreboard. See, we come here, we come here to win. But we're William and Mary young people. There's more than just a scoreboard, isn't it? It's how we play.

We have to exhibit… the honor, the integrity, the class that's indicative of a William & Mary alum. See, it's not only about going out and earning what it is your right to earn, it's also about making the world a better place to live.

It's not about fame and fortune. You can keep the fame and fortune. Well, some of the fortune. It's about impact, and inspiring. That is as much your task as it is playing the game to win. 

And one thing I know about this group, is that this group is capable, not only of winning, but winning in just that fashion… impacting, and inspiring. 

Those around you, and more importantly those that come after you.

Lastly, and this is a mandate, team. It is critical for success in today's game.
I mandate, I urge you, never, ever, stop dreaming. That will be the biggest change in your life when you walk out of this locker room door today. It's one of the things I love about working with younger people, in the business that I'm in. When you're young, you dream and you dream wildly. You do. And it's awesome.

The dreams are limitless. They know no bounds. On the other side of that door today, young people, is a reality, is a life. And if you are not careful, they'll diminish the dream.

The people that I come across, being blessed with being able to do what I do for a living. I come across people that are successful in every walk of life. It's one common bond that I notice that they all have… they're ridiculous dreamers. 

Don't ever stop being that. I'm a ridiculous dreamer. To this day I do it. The difference is, what separates our dreams from the ones we all shared when we were children, is that we have to make daily choices, to take action. To make those dreams a reality. That is what I mandate for this team to do today. 

Continue to dream. Don't let the realities of the world that awaits you on the other side of that locker room door, diminish those dreams. Make the conscious daily decisions to take action to make those dreams a reality.

And our paths will cross again. In the victory lane. 

And the only thing I want to know… is who you've impacted, and who've you inspired. And we will share stories… of the Library. Of Paul's… of the Sunken Gardens. 

It has been my honor and pleasure to share this day with you today. Congratulations to you, and may God bless you and keep you.

I’m glad to be here today. Hell, I’m glad to be anywhere today. President Cohen asked me to come and give the charge to the graduates. I assure you it’s nothing compared to the charge you have just given me. This is an incredible place. I’ve seen it through so many lenses. I saw it when I was a graduate student that didn’t get admitted and then somebody invited me back and said that “Okay, we’ll change our mind.” I saw it as a place that hired me back to be on the faculty many years later and then gave me the chance to do what anybody wants to do which is follow their passion follow their heart and do the things they’re excited about. The great thing about this university unlike almost all of the other ones I know of is that nobody gets in your way when you try to do it and that’s just fantastic. To the degree that a human being can love an institution I love this place and I love all of the people and I’m very grateful to Jerry Cohen and everyone else for all the kindness that has been shown to me.

Last August I was told it was likely that I had three to six months to live. I’m on month nine now and I’m not going to get down and do any pushups but there will be a short pickup basketball game later. Somebody said to me, in light of those numbers, “Wow, so you’re really beating the Grimm Reaper.” and what I said without even thinking about it is that we don’t beat the reaper by living longer. We beat the Reaper by living well and living fully, for the Reaper will come for all of us. The question is what we will do between the time we’re born and the time he shows up, because when he shows up it’s too late to do all the things that you always want to kind of get around to.

I think the only advice I can give you on how to live your life well is first off remember, it’s a cliché but I love clichés, it is not the things we do in live that we regret on our deathbed. It is the things we do not. I assure you I’ve done a lot of really stupid things and none of them bother me. All of the mistakes and all of the dopey things and all of the times I was embarrassed, they don’t matter. What matters is that I can look back and say pretty much anytime I got a chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it. That’s where my solace comes from.

The second thing that I would add to that and I didn’t coordinate on the subject of this word, but I think it’s the right word that comes up, is passion. You will need to find your passion. Many of you have already done it. Many of you will later. Many of you may take until your 30’s or 40’s but don’t give up on finding it because then all you’re doing is waiting on the Reaper. Find your passion and follow it. If there is anything I have learned in my life you will not find that passion in things and you will not find that passion in money because the more things and the more money you have the more you will just look around and use that as the metric and there will always be someone with more.

Your passion must come from the things that fill you from the inside. Honors and awards are nice things but only to the extent that they regard the real respect from your peers. To be thought well of by other people that you think even more highly of is a tremendous honor that I’ve been granted.

Find your passion, and in my experience, no matter what you do at work or what you do in official settings that passion will be grounded in people. It will be grounded in the relationships you have with people and what they think of you when your time comes. If you can gain the respect of those around you and the passion and the true love, and I’ve said this before, I waited until 39 to get married because I had to wait that long to find someone whose happiness was more important than mine. If nothing else I hope that all of you can find that kind of passion and that kind of love in your life. Thank you.

Father Levesque, Members of the Board, Administration, Faculty and Staff, Friends and Honored Guests of Niagara University, Members of the Class of 2008.  Thank you for this honor and the opportunity to share of few thoughts with you, my new classmates.

I graduated from Niagara University 30 years ago and it is hard for me to believe how time has flown by.  Thanks to my Niagara education, my life has moved along an unbelievable path I never would have dreamed of when I sat 30 years ago, like you, hoping that the commencement speech would be short.

It was not.  Although most graduates do not remember who spoke at their graduations, I do.  It was the Canadian philosopher and scholar Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980) and his topic was “The Untapped Resources of the Left Hemisphere of the Brain.” He spoke for an hour! 

Let me put your minds at ease.  Let me simply suggest that today you give some thought to what I shall call “Life After Niagara” and some “rules to live by.”

Believe in yourself.  Before you can accomplish anything in life --- certainly anything good, enduring or worthwhile --- you must believe you can do it.  William Shakespeare once wrote, “our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win, by fearing to attempt (Measure for Measure, act I, scene IV) .”  When you first arrived at Niagara University, you brought with you a suitcase full of hopes and dreams.  It was your opportunity to begin, to strike out on your own, to test everything you had known and seen in a laboratory of new ideas and knowledge.  During your time here, you met extraordinary people: great professors who helped shape your world view and classmates with whom you shared the best years of your life.  During your time here, you experienced things that opened your mind and stretched your horizons.  During your time here, your values were challenged, perhaps your own faith was tested.   Now, on your graduation day, the time has come for you to pack up that suitcase and move on.  What have you filled it with this time, some four or five years later?  Where are you headed?  What will you bring with you on this new journey that you begin today?  More hopes and dreams to be sure.  But none of that matters, none of your relationships or your experiences or your values or your education, if you do not believe in yourself and your ability to face the world with all of those things as part of your own life.  And you have no reason to believe in yourself if you do not first believe that you have been loved by the God who gave you life.  Yes, your fingerprints are uniquely yours.  But remember, they are uniquely yours because God traced them on your hands as a reflection of his own.  No one knows what tomorrow will bring for you, but if you believe in yourself, you will be ready for whatever comes your way.  Set your goals.  Aim high but make sure they are realistic.  And walk out these doors today believing in yourself.   

Respect Others.  The mark of an educated person is civility, a characteristic that recognizes the fact that just as I am created in God’s image as unique and worthy of respect, others, too --- with their own uniqueness and worth --- deserve respect.  This is something often talked about in our politically correct society but not always with credibility.  The evidence is not always demonstrated by the way that people live their lives and go about their business.  Civility is another word for respect.  Common courtesy is not that common.  You should be the exception.  Civility has its roots in the belief in the dignity of the human person, every person.  An educated person does not sacrifice respect for others, for anything.  Civility does not mean that you should become a door mat or that you should hesitate to speak the truth or that you should compromise your integrity and good conscience.  It does mean that you should remember that there is another person at the other end of your emails or phone calls or letters or conversations.  St. Vincent de Paul once remarked, "Make it a practice to judge persons and things in the most favorable light at all times and under all circumstances."  Walk out these doors today determined to grow in your respect for others.           

Put others first.  Selfishness and self-centeredness are terminal diseases.  They are the cancer that kills healthy relationships; they destroy healthy opportunities in life.  Unfortunately we live in a society and at a time, when “me” comes first and that is not healthy.  That is no way to live.  Such an approach to life prevents us from realizing our truest nature: we humans are social beings, created in the image and likeness of God, a trinity of persons.  That line from the musical, Les Miserables, rings so true: “to love another person is to see the face of God.”  We are not called simply to see God’s face but also to be God’s face, to show God’s face.  St. Vincent de Paul once questioned, “But do you know what it is to labor in charity? It is to labor in God, for God is charity, and it is to labor for God purely and entirely; it is to do so in the grace of God.”  Putting the other first enables us to do just that.  Walk out these doors today convinced that putting others first is the way to go.    

Live your faith.  You chose to study at Niagara University and Niagara is a Catholic and Vincentian university.  No matter what your religion might be, Niagara is a university at age 150, formed by 2,000 years of Christian tradition and history, shaped by a Catholic vision and Catholic values that are, as the word Catholic means, “universal.” Our Vincentian identity and mission recognize that there is something good and purposeful in every life, especially the poor; that there is a right and a wrong way to live in this world and that our choices and our freedom are not arbitrary things.  Just a month ago, speaking on my campus in Washington, Pope Benedict XVI reminded Catholic educators that “freedom is not an opting out.  It is an opting in --- that authentic freedom can never be attained by turning from God.”  That, while differences exist among us as individuals, there is a common good that is accessible to the mind and heart, that is noble and worth pursuing.  A Catholic university seeks truth and the fullest truth includes both reason and faith.  If Catholic education does not offer you both, it has failed.  On the other hand, if you have learned that reason and faith do, indeed, influence who you are and what you will become, there is no greater success for a Catholic university except for one thing: that your education moves you to live your faith and put it into practice, day in, day out --- without apology or compromise.  That’s what it means to be Vincentian.  You must stand up and be counted as a believer whose beliefs are a real and integral of daily life.  Walk out these doors today committed to living your faith.

Make a difference.  Commencement literally means beginning, not end.  Are you a different person than you were four or five years ago?  If your answer is “no,” then the grades and awards you have received do not really matter.  If your answer is “no,” then you should receive a magna cum mediocrity.  If, on the other hand, you can say “yes,” I am different, I have changed, I am stronger, better, fuller, more complete --- in other words, I am an educated person --- you are clearly not at the end but, rather, you are commencing something wonderful and exciting and full of promise.  If you reach out for your diploma believing in yourself --- and being grateful; respecting others --- being grateful; putting others first --- and being grateful; living your faith --- and being grateful; if you reach out for your diploma today and can truly say that these are among the rules you live by, then your years at Niagara University will not only have been a success but will be the occasion for you to make a difference in the world.  Have something to show for your life, right now.  Have something to show for your efforts, for your study, for your sacrifice and that of your parents, right now.  Have the courage to make a difference because of what you have learned and the person you have become, right now as you walk out these doors.

I have no delusion or even a modest expectation that years from now you will have any recollection of who spoke at your graduation from Niagara University today.  I do hope and pray, however, that some small part of what I have said to you today might be the occasion for you to have developed your own “rules to live by.”  Congratulations, graduates.  May God bless you and those you love most in the world.  We are all very proud of you!


Good afternoon fellow students, professors, TAs, RAs, LSAT, GRE tutors, Sodexo workers, overly emotional parents, annoying little brothers and sisters, grandparents that cannot believe that Binghamton is this cold and the people who accidentally walked in here thinking there was a basketball game.I hope to inspire many of you with the speech I have prepared, some of you may smile, some may cry but I especially hope to make the woman doing sign language laugh at least once.

When I was told I was going to be the undergraduate speaker at commencement ceremony, they said it was because one quality I had that won the interviewers over, I was an average Binghamton student.

I said, finally, our time has come; for far too long. Our voices, the voices of the average have been drown out in a sea of unique individuals and overly exceptional people.

There's more, trust me.

All the years of relatively mediocrity and refusing to think outside the box have finally paid off. We are the average who have continued to prove that procrastination and apathy are not just big words but also a way of life.

This speech is for the student who has never seen extra credit as an opportunity but instead a threat.

The same student, who still believes, that one day there will be a snow day.

This speech is for the professor who understands that Wikipedia is the greatest invention on the 21st century [Applause] and turnitin.com is not, AT ALL, EVER!

This speech is for the parent who sends large packages of Swedish fish and sour patch kids every Halloween, thank you mom.

This speech is for the parent who told everyone they know and even complete strangers about how their daughter is getting a scholarship to go to the University of Maryland but their son couldn't find a job in Binghamton, thank you dad.

Looking back to freshman year it does feel like it was only yesterday; the first class, the first test, the first roommate, the second roommate, the third roommate, the figuring out that you were the problem.

The first and only encounter with a frat party, the first and only encounter with a girl.

The first time you realized, you really learned, money does not grow on trees, its actually millions of cotton fibers woven together but there are no sheep in Binghamton so you had to call your parents and they send you a sheep in the mail and then you had to clarify.

The point is we all came to Binghamton University knowing little of what we would become or what we would accomplish but we will leave knowing who we are and that is a gift to be treasured and remembered.

Maybe, maybe average is the new exceptional, we live in a culture that emphasizes wealth, power and achievement. We are taught by society that we should strive for fame, fortune and the American Dream.

I am sorry to say average will never be fame or fortune or the American Dream, average is something much more.

Average is the parent who drives their son or daughter to school every day so their child may have a better life than the one they had.

Average is the professor who helps you understand that knowing who you are and owning your own sense of identity will not only make you a stronger individual here but more importantly in life.

Average is the professor who teaches you that the Cosby show broke racial barriers, South Park broke cultural barriers and Sex in the City did nothing for women's lib.

Average is the LSAT tutor who hated law school and wishes they could do it all over again but loves working with students.

Average is the girlfriend taking the LSAT leaving you to hope and pray that she becomes the sugar momma you know she can be.

Average is the roommate who understands that a major portion of the college experience is reverting back to things you thought was cool in the third grade. Playing Nintendo 64 watching Rene and Skimpy and eating Lunchables for dinner.

Average is knowing that you don't receive respect, you earn it and you aren't given opportunity, you fight for it. And if anyone tries to tell you different they're lying.

Average is amazing next to Twinkies and Facebook, average is one of the greatest things in the world. And I know that today is suppose to be about celebrating our graduation from Binghamton but we also need to celebrate the people around us, the people who helped shape us into who we are now.

Today represents the beginning for all of us and I encourage you, no I implore you to say thank you. Thank your friends, your professors, your family and even thank your little sisters; and than celebrate the beginning together.

As we look ahead in to the future, do not forget the lessons of the past, remember people that aspired to achieve greatness: Kanye West, Sarah Palin, Britney Spears, Glenn Beck.

Lets face it being average has its perks; no one thinks you're crazy and people will generally like you. Which brings me to my final point, rather than saying something trite or corny about Binghamton being a stepping stone in the journey of our lives; I want to leave you all with a quote of a personal hero of mine, in the immortal words of Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas.

Tonight's going to be a good night. Thank you

Well, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. What a great introduction, what a wonderful thing. What a great, great welcome I'm getting here, so thank you very much. I mean, I haven't heard applause like that since I announced that I was going to stop acting.

But anyway, it is really terrific to see here so many graduate students and undergraduate students graduating here today. I heard that there are 4,500 graduating here today, undergraduate students, so this is fantastic. There are 2,200 men, 2,300 women and five have listed yourselves as undecided.

So this is really a great, great bunch of people here, I love it. But seriously, President Sample, trustees, faculty, family, friends and graduates, it is a tremendous privilege to stand before you this morning. There's nothing that I enjoy more than celebrating great achievements. And I don't just mean your parents celebrating never having to pay another tuition bill, that's not what I'm talking about.

I'm talking about just celebrating the great accomplishment. So let me congratulate the Trojan class of 2009 on your graduation from one of the finest universities in the world. Let's give our graduates a tremendous round of applause. What a special day, what a great accomplishment.

Now, this an equally special day, of course, for the parents, for the grandparents, siblings and other family members whose support made all of this today possible. And let's not forget, of course, the professors, those dedicated individuals who taught you, who came up with exciting ways to share their vast wisdom, knowledge and experience with you.

And I must also say thank you to President Sample for honoring me with this fantastic degree. Thank you very much. Wow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Doctor of Humane Letters. I love it. But, of course, I noticed that it wasn't a doctorate in film or in cinema or in acting. I wonder why?

But anyway, that's OK. I take whatever I can get. But maybe now since I'm the doctor, I can go back up to Sacramento and maybe now the Legislature will finally listen to me. But anyway, I stand before you today not just as Dr. Schwarzenegger or as Governor Schwarzenegger, or as The Terminator, or as Conan the Barbarian, but also as a proud new member of this Trojan family.Now, some of you may know that my daughter just completed her freshman year right here. One of the most exciting things for me has been to learn about the great traditions that make this university so wonderful and so special.

My daughter told me all about, for instance, the Victory Bell. She sat me down and she told me it weighs 295 pounds and how the winner of the annual football game between USC and UCLA takes this bell and gets to paint it in the school colors. And I stopped her in the middle of talking, I said, "Wait a minute, Katherine, back up a little bit. UCLA has a football team?"

Now, of course, my daughter's journey here at USC is just beginning, and yours is ending. I know that you're a little bit stressed out right now as you start this exciting new chapter in your lives. Some people say it is scary to leave the comfort of the university and to go out into the cold, hard world.

But I have to tell you something; I think this is a bunch of nonsense because after all, this is America. This is the greatest country on earth, with the greatest opportunities. It is one thing if you were born in Afghanistan or in Swat Valley in Pakistan where you'd be forced to join the Taliban or be killed. Now, then I would say yes, that is a little bit scary.

But this, this is going to be a piece of cake for you, trust me. You live in America and you're prepared for the future with this tremendous education you have gotten here at one of the greatest universities in the world. This is going to be exciting, it's a great adventure and this is a new phase in your life. This is going to be awesome.

Now, of course, this journey is not going to be without any setbacks, failures or disappointments. That's just the way life is. But you're ready and you are able, and you would not be here today with your degrees and with your honors if you wouldn't be ready.

So now, of course, to help you along the way, I thought that the best Schwarzenegger gift I could give you today is to give you a few of my own personal ideas on how to be successful. And parents, I just want you to know, maybe you should close your ears, you should plug your ears, because maybe there a few things that you maybe won't like in what I have to say.

But anyway, I can explain how I became successful and who I am today by going through what I call Dr. Schwarzenegger's Six Rules of Success.

Now, of course, people ask me all the time, they say to me, "What is the secret to success?" And I give them always the short version. I say, "Number one, come to America. Number two, work your butt off. And number three, marry a Kennedy."

But anyway, those are the short rules. Now today, I'm going to give you the six rules of success. But before I start, I just wanted to say these are my rules. I think that they can apply to anyone, but that is for you to decide, because not everyone is the same. There are some people that just like to kick back and coast through life and others want to be very intense and want to be number one and want to be successful. And that's like me.

I always wanted to be very intense, I always wanted to be number one. I took it very seriously, my career. So this was the same when I started with bodybuilding. I didn't want to just be a bodybuilding champion, I wanted to be the best bodybuilder of all time. The same was in the movies. I didn't want to just be a movie star; I wanted to be a great movie star that is the highest paid movie star and have above-the-title billing.

And so this intensity always paid off for me, this commitment always paid off for me. So here are some of the rules.

The first rule is: Trust yourself

And what I mean by that is, so many young people are getting so much advice from their parents and from their teachers and from everyone. But what is most important is that you have to dig deep down, dig deep down and ask yourselves, who do you want to be? Not what, but who.

And I'm talking about not what your parents and teachers want you to be, but you. I'm talking about figuring out for yourselves what makes you happy, no matter how crazy it may sound to other people.

I was lucky growing up because I did not have television or didn't have telephones, I didn't have the computers and the iPods. And, of course, Twitter was then something that birds did outside the window. I didn't have all these distractions and all this.

I spent a lot of time by myself, so I could figure out and listen to what is inside my heart and inside my head.And I recognized very quickly that inside my head and heart were a burning desire to leave my small village in Austria -- not that there was something wrong with Austria, it's a beautiful country. But I wanted to leave that little place and I wanted to be part of something big, the United States of America, a powerful nation, the place where dreams can come true.

I knew when I came over here I could realize my dreams. And I decided that the best way for me to come to America was to become a bodybuilding champion, because I knew that was ticket the instant that I saw a magazine cover of my idol, Reg Park. He was Mr. Universe, he was starring in Hercules movies, he looked strong and powerful, he was so confident.

So when I found out how he got that way I became obsessed, and I went home and I said to my family, "I want to be a bodybuilding champion."

Now, you can imagine how that went over in my home in Austria. My parents, they couldn't believe it. They would have been just happy if I would have become a police officer like my father, or married someone like Heidi, had a bunch of kids and ran around like the von Trapp family in Sound of Music.

That's what my family had in mind for me, but something else burned inside me. Something burned inside me. I wanted to be different; I was determined to be unique. I was driven to think big and to dream big. Everyone else thought that I was crazy. My friends said, "If you want to be a champion in a sport, why don't you go and become a bicycle champion or a skiing champion or a soccer champion? Those are the Austrian sports."

But I didn't care. I wanted to be a bodybuilding champion and use that to come to America, and use that to go into the movies and make millions of dollars. So, of course, for extra motivation I read books on strongmen and on bodybuilding and looked at magazines. And one of the things I did was, I decorated my bedroom wall.

Right next to my bed there was this big wall that I decorated all with pictures. I hung up pictures of strongmen and bodybuilders and wrestlers and boxers and so on. And I was so excited about this great decoration that I took my mother to the bedroom and I showed her. And she shook her head. She was absolutely in shock and tears started running down her eyes.

And she called the doctor, she called our house doctor and she brought him in and she explained to him, "There's something wrong here." She looked at the wall with the doctor and she said, "Where did I go wrong? I mean, all of Arnold's friends have pictures on the wall of girls, and Arnold has all these men.

But it's not just men, they're half naked and they're oiled up with baby oil. What is going on here? Where did I go wrong?" So you can imagine, the doctor shook his head and he said, "There's nothing wrong. At this age you have idols and you go and have those -- this is just quite normal."

So this is rule number one. I wanted to become a champion; I was on a mission. So rule number one is, of course, trust yourself, no matter how and what anyone else thinks.

Rule number two is: Break the rules

We have so many rules in life about everything. I say break the rules. Not the law, but break the rules. My wife has a t-shirt that says, "Well-behaved women rarely make history." Well, you know, I don't want to burst her bubble, but the same is true with men.

It is impossible to be a maverick or a true original if you're too well behaved and don't want to break the rules. You have to think outside the box. That's what I believe. After all, what is the point of being on this earth if all you want to do is be liked by everyone and avoid trouble?

The only way that I ever got anyplace was by breaking some of the rules. After all, I remember that after I was finished with my bodybuilding career I wanted to get into acting and I wanted to be a star in films. You can imagine what the agents said when I went to meet all those agents. Everyone had the same line, that it can't be done, the rules are different here. They said, "Look at your body. You have this huge monstrous body, overly developed. That doesn't fit into the movies. You don't understand.

This was 20 years ago, the Hercules movies. Now the little guys are in, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, Jack Nicholson." Before he gained weight, of course, that is. But anyway, those are the guys that were in. And the agents also complained about my accent. They said, "No one ever became a star with an accent like that, especially not with a German accent.

And yes, I can imagine with your name, Arnold Schwartzenschnitzel, or whatever the name, is, on a billboard. Yeah, that's going to draw a lot of tickets and sell a lot of tickets. Yeah, right." So this is the kind of negative attitude they had.

But I didn't listen to those rules, even though they were very nice and they said, "Look, we can get you some bit parts. We can get you to be playing a wrestler or a bouncer. Oh, maybe with your German accent we can get you to be a Nazi officer in Hogan's Heroes or something like that."

But I didn't listen to all this. Those were their rules, not my rules. I was convinced I could do it if I worked as hard as I did in bodybuilding, five hours a day. And I started getting to work, I started taking acting classes. I took English classes, took speech classes, dialogue classes. Accent removal classes I even took.

I remember running around saying, "A fine wine grows on the vine." You see, because Germans have difficulties with the F and the W and V, so, "A fine wine grows on the vine." I know what some of you are now saying, is I hope that Arnold got his money back.

But let me tell you something, I had a good time doing those things and it really helped me. And finally I broke through. I broke through and I started getting the first parts in TV; Streets of San Francisco, Lucille Ball hired me, I made Pumping Iron, Stay Hungry. And then I got the big break in Conan the Barbarian.

And there the director said, "If we wouldn't have Schwarzenegger, we would have to build one." Now, think about that. And then, when I did Terminator, "I'll be back," became one of the most famous lines in movie history, all because of my crazy accent.

Now, think about it. The things that the agents said would be totally a detriment and would make it impossible for me to get a job, all of a sudden became an asset for me, all of those things, my accent, my body and everything.

So it just shows to you, never listen to that you can't do something. And, "You have to work your way up, of course, run for something else first." I mean, it was the same when I ran for governor, the same lines, that you have to work your way up, it can't be done. And then, of course, I ran for governor and the rest, of course, is history.

They said you have to start with a small job as mayor and then as assemblyman and then as lieutenant governor and then as governor. And they said that's the way it works in a political career. I said, "I'm not interested in a political career. I want to be a public servant. I want to fix California's problems and bring people together and bring the parties together.

So, like I said, I decided to run, I didn't pay attention to the rules. And I made it and the rest is history. Which, of course, brings me to rule number three: Don't be afraid to fail.

Anything I've ever attempted, I was always willing to fail. In the movie business, I remember, that you pick scripts. Many times you think this is a wining script, but then, of course, you find out later on, when you do the movie, that it didn't work and the movie goes in the toilet.

Now, we have seen my movies; I mean, Red Sonja, Hercules in New York, Last Action Hero. Those movies went in the toilet. But that's OK, because at the same time I made movies like Terminator and Conan and True Lies and Predator and Twins that went through the roof.

So you can't always win, but don't afraid of making decisions.

You can't be paralyzed by fear of failure or you will never push yourself. You keep pushing because you believe in yourself and in your vision and you know that it is the right thing to do, and success will come. So don't be afraid to fail.

Rule number four: Don't listen to the naysayers.

How many times have you heard that you can't do this and you can't do that and it's never been done before? Just imagine if Bill Gates had quit when people said it can't be done.

I hear this all the time. As a matter of fact, I love it when someone says that no one has ever done this before, because then when I do it that means that I'm the first one that has done it. So pay no attention to the people that say it can't be done.

I remember my mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, when she started Special Olympics in 1968 people said that it would not work. The experts, the doctors that specialized in mental disabilities and mental retardation said, "It can't be done. You can't bring people out of their institutions. You can't make them participate in sports, in jumping and swimming and in running. They will hurt themselves, they will hurt each other, they will drown in the pool."

Well, let me tell you something. Now, 40 years later, Special Olympics is one of the greatest organizations, in 164 countries, dedicated to people with mental disabilities and that are intellectually challenged.

And she did not take no for an answer. And the same is when you look at Barack Obama. I mean, imagine, if he would have listened. (Applause) If he would have listened to the naysayers he would have never run for president. People said it couldn't be done, that he couldn't get elected, that he couldn't beat Hillary Clinton, that he would never win the general election.

But he followed his own heart, he didn't listen to the "You can't," and he changed the course of American history.

So over and over you see that. If I would have listened to the naysayers I would still be in the Austrian Alps yodeling. I would never have come to America. I would have never met my wonderful wife Maria Shriver, I would have never had the wonderful four kids, I would have never done Terminator, and I wouldn't be standing here in front of you today as governor of the greatest state of the greatest country in the world.

So I never listen that, "You can't." I always listen to myself and say, "Yes, you can."

And that brings me to rule number five, which is the most important rule of all: Work your butt off. You never want to fail because you didn't work hard enough. I never wanted to lose a competition or lose an election because I didn't work hard enough. I always believed leaving no stone unturned.

Mohammed Ali, one of my great heroes, had a great line in the '70s when he was asked, "How many sit-ups do you do?" He said, "I don't count my sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting. When I feel pain, that's when I start counting, because that's when it really counts."

That's what makes you a champion. Arnold Scvhwarzenegger in Kindergarten CopAnd that's the way it is with everything. No pain, no gain. So many of those lessons that I apply in life I have learned from sports, let me tell you, and especially that one. And let me tell you, it is important to have fun in life, of course.

But when you're out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard.

Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning. Just remember that. Now, if you want to coast through life, don't pay attention to any of those rules.

But if you want to win, there is absolutely no way around hard, hard work.

None of my rules, by the way, of success, will work unless you do. I've always figured out that there 24 hours a day. You sleep six hours and have 18 hours left. Now, I know there are some of you out there that say well, wait a minute, I sleep eight hours or nine hours. Well, then, just sleep faster, I would recommend.

Because you only need to sleep six hours and then you have 18 hours left, and there are a lot of things you can accomplish. As a matter of fact, Ed Turner used to say always, "Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and advertise."

And, of course, all of you know already those things, because otherwise you wouldn't be sitting here today. Just remember, you can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.

And that takes me to rule number six, which is a very important rule: it's about giving back. Whatever path that you take in your lives, you must always find time to give something back, something back to your community, give something back to your state or to your country.

My father-in-law, Sargent Shriver -- who is a great American, a truly great American who started the Peace Corps, the Job Corps, Legal Aid to the Poor -- he said at Yale University to the students at a commencement speech, "Tear down that mirror. Tear down that mirror that makes you always look at yourself, and you will be able to look beyond that mirror and you will see the millions of people that need your help."

And let me tell you something, reaching out and helping people will bring you more satisfaction than anything else you have ever done. As a matter of fact today, after having worked for Special Olympics and having started After School Programs, I've promoted fitness, and now with my job as governor, I can tell you, playing a game of chess with an eight-year-old kid in an inner city school is far more exciting for me than walking down another red carpet or a movie premiere.

So let me tell you, as you prepare to go off into the world, remember those six rules:

Trust yourself, Break some rules, Don't be afraid to fail, Ignore the naysayers, Work like hell, and Give something back.

And now let me leave you with one final thought, and I will be brief, I promise. This university was conceived in 1880, back when Los Angeles was just a small frontier town. One hundred and twenty-five classes of Trojans have gone before you. They have sat there, exactly where you sit today, in good times and in bad, in times of war and in times of peace, in times of great promise and in times of great uncertainty.

Through it all, this great country, this great state, this great university, have stood tall and persevered. We are in tough times now and there's a lot of uncertainty in the world. But there is one thing certain; we'll be back.

And we will back stronger and more prosperous than ever before, because that is what California and America have always done. The ancient Trojans were known for their fighting spirit, their refusal to give up, their ability to overcome great odds.

So as you graduate today, never lose that optimism and that fighting spirit. Never lose the spirit of Troy. Because remember, this is America and you are USC Trojans, proud, strong and ready to soar. Congratulations and God bless all of you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ASU. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you -- please. Well, thank you, President Crow, for that extremely generous introduction, for your inspired leadership as well here at ASU. And I want to thank the entire ASU community for the honor of attaching my name to a scholarship program that will help open the doors of higher education to students from every background. What a wonderful gift. Thank you. That notion of opening doors of opportunity to everybody, that is the core mission of this school; it's a core mission of my presidency; and I hope this program will serve as a model for universities across this country. So thank you so much.

I want to obviously congratulate the Class of 2009you're your unbelievable achievement. I want to thank the parents, the uncles, the grandpas, the grandmas, cousins -- Calabash cousins -- everybody who was involved in helping these extraordinary young people arrive at this moment. I also want to apologize to the entire state of Arizona for stealing away your wonderful former governor, Janet Napolitano. But you've got a fine governor here and I also know that Janet is applying her extraordinary talents to serve our entire country as the Secretary of Homeland Security, keeping America safe. And she's doing a great job.

Now, before I begin, I'd just like to clear the air about that little controversy everybody was talking about a few weeks back. I have to tell you, I really thought this was much ado about nothing, but I do think we all learned an important lesson. I learned never again to pick another team over the Sun Devils in my NCAA bracket. It won't happen again. President Crow and the Board of Regents will soon learn all about being audited by the IRS.

Now, in all seriousness, I come here not to dispute the suggestion that I haven't yet achieved enough in my life. First of all, Michelle concurs with that assessment. She has a long list of things that I have not yet done waiting for me when I get home. But more than that, I come to embrace the notion that I haven't done enough in my life; I heartily concur; I come to affirm that one's title, even a title like President of the United States, says very little about how well one's life has been led -- that no matter how much you've done, or how successful you've been, there's always more to do, always more to learn, and always more to achieve. 

And I want to say to you today, graduates, Class of 2009, that despite having achieved a remarkable milestone in your life, despite the fact that you and your families are so rightfully proud, you too cannot rest on your laurels. Not even some of those remarkable young people who were introduced earlier -- not even that young lady who's got four degrees yet today. You can't rest. Your own body of work is also yet to come.

Now, some graduating classes have marched into this stadium in easy times -- times of peace and stability when we call on our graduates simply to keep things going, and don't screw it up. Other classes have received their diplomas in times of trial and upheaval, when the very foundations of our lives, the old order has been shaken, the old ideas and institutions have crumbled, and a new generation is called upon to remake the world.

It should be clear to you by now the category into which all of you fall. For we gather here tonight in times of extraordinary difficulty, for the nation and for the world. The economy remains in the midst of a historic recession, the worst we've seen since the Great Depression; the result, in part, of greed and irresponsibility that rippled out from Wall Street and Washington, as we spent beyond our means and failed to make hard choices. We're engaged in two wars and a struggle against terrorism. The threats of climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemic defy national boundaries and easy solutions.

For many of you, these challenges are also felt in more personal terms. Perhaps you're still looking for a job -- or struggling to figure out what career path makes sense in this disrupted economy. Maybe you've got student loans -- no, you definitely have student loans -- or credit card debts, and you're wondering how you'll ever pay them off. Maybe you've got a family to raise, and you're wondering how you'll ensure that your children have the same opportunities you've had to get an education and pursue their dreams.

Now, in the face of these challenges, it may be tempting to fall back on the formulas for success that have been pedaled so frequently in recent years. It goes something like this: You're taught to chase after all the usual brass rings; you try to be on this "who's who" list or that top 100 list; you chase after the big money and you figure out how big your corner office is; you worry about whether you have a fancy enough title or a fancy enough car. That's the message that's sent each and every day, or has been in our culture for far too long -- that through material possessions, through a ruthless competition pursued only on your own behalf -- that's how you will measure success.

Now, you can take that road -- and it may work for some. But at this critical juncture in our nation's history, at this difficult time, let me suggest that such an approach won't get you where you want to go; it displays a poverty of ambition -- that in fact, the elevation of appearance over substance, of celebrity over character, of short-term gain over lasting achievement is precisely what your generation needs to help end.

Now, ASU, I want to highlight -- I want to highlight two main problems with that old, tired, me-first approach. First, it distracts you from what's truly important, and may lead you to compromise your values and your principles and commitments. Think about it. It's in chasing titles and status -- in worrying about the next election rather than the national interest and the interests of those who you're supposed to represent -- that politicians so often lose their ways in Washington. They spend time thinking about polls, but not about principle. It was in pursuit of gaudy short-term profits, and the bonuses that came with them, that so many folks lost their way on Wall Street, engaging in extraordinary risks with other people's money.

In contrast, the leaders we revere, the businesses and institutions that last -- they are not generally the result of a narrow pursuit of popularity or personal advancement, but of devotion to some bigger purpose -- the preservation of the Union or the determination to lift a country out of a depression; the creation of a quality product, a commitment to your customers, your workers, your shareholders and your community. A commitment to make sure that an institution like ASU is inclusive and diverse and giving opportunity to all. That's a hallmark of real success.

That other stuff -- that other stuff, the trappings of success may be a byproduct of this larger mission, but it can't be the central thing. Just ask Bernie Madoff. That's the first problem with the old attitude.

But the second problem with the old approach to success is that a relentless focus on the outward markers of success can lead to complacency. It can make you lazy. We too often let the external, the material things, serve as indicators that we're doing well, even though something inside us tells us that we're not doing our best; that we're avoiding that which is hard, but also necessary; that we're shrinking from, rather than rising to, the challenges of the age. And the thing is, in this new, hyper-competitive age, none of us -- none of us -- can afford to be complacent.

That's true in whatever profession you choose. Professors might earn the distinction of tenure, but that doesn't guarantee that they'll keep putting in the long hours and late nights -- and have the passion and the drive -- to be great educators. The same principle is true in your personal life. Being a parent is not just a matter of paying the bills, doing the bare minimum -- it's not bringing a child into the world that matters, but the acts of love and sacrifice it takes to raise and educate that child and give them opportunity. It can happen to Presidents, as well. If you think about it, Abraham Lincoln and Millard Fillmore had the very same title, they were both Presidents of the United States, but their tenure in office and their legacy could not be more different.

And that's not just true for individuals -- it's also true for this nation. In recent years, in many ways, we've become enamored with our own past success -- lulled into complacency by the glitter of our own achievements.

We've become accustomed to the title of "military super-power," forgetting the qualities that got us there -- not just the power of our weapons, but the discipline and valor and the code of conduct of our men and women in uniform. The Marshall Plan, and the Peace Corps, and all those initiatives that show our commitment to working with other nations to pursue the ideals of opportunity and equality and freedom that have made us who we are. That's what made us a super power.

We've become accustomed to our economic dominance in the world, forgetting that it wasn't reckless deals and get-rich-quick schemes that got us where we are, but hard work and smart ideas -- quality products and wise investments. We started taking shortcuts. We started living on credit, instead of building up savings. We saw businesses focus more on rebranding and repackaging than innovating and developing new ideas that improve our lives.

All the while, the rest of the world has grown hungrier, more restless -- in constant motion to build and to discover -- not content with where they are right now, determined to strive for more. They're coming.

So graduates, it's now abundantly clear that we need to start doing things a little bit different. In your own lives, you'll need to continuously adapt to a continuously changing economy. You'll end up having more than one job and more than one career over the course of your life; to keep gaining new skills -- possibly even new degrees; and you'll have to keep on taking risks as new opportunities arise.

And as a nation, we'll need a fundamental change of perspective and attitude. It's clear that we need to build a new foundation -- a stronger foundation -- for our economy and our prosperity, rethinking how we grow our economy, how we use energy, how we educate our children, how we care for our sick, how we treat our environment.

Many of our current challenges are unprecedented. There are no standard remedies, no go-to fixes this time around. And Class of 2009 that's why we're going to need your help. We need young people like you to step up. We need your daring, we need your enthusiasm and your energy, we need your imagination.

And let me be clear, when I say "young," I'm not just referring to the date of your birth certificate. I'm talking about an approach to life -- a quality of mind and quality of heart; a willingness to follow your passions, regardless of whether they lead to fortune and fame; a willingness to question conventional wisdom and rethink old dogmas; a lack of regard for all the traditional markers of status and prestige -- and a commitment instead to doing what's meaningful to you, what helps others, what makes a difference in this world.

That's the spirit that led a band of patriots not much older than most of you to take on an empire, to start this experiment in democracy we call America. It's what drove young pioneers west, to Arizona and beyond; it's what drove young women to reach for the ballot; what inspired a 30 year-old escaped slave to run an underground railroad to freedom -- what inspired a young man named Cesar to go out and help farm workers; what inspired a 26 year-old preacher to lead a bus boycott for justice. It's what led firefighters and police officers in the prime of their lives up the stairs of those burning towers; and young people across this country to drop what they were doing and come to the aid of a flooded New Orleans. It's what led two guys in a garage -- named Hewlett and Packard -- to form a company that would change the way we live and work; what led scientists in laboratories, and novelists in coffee shops to labor in obscurity until they finally succeeded in changing the way we see the world.

That's the great American story: young people just like you, following their passions, determined to meet the times on their own terms. They weren't doing it for the money. Their titles weren't fancy -- ex-slave, minister, student, citizen. A whole bunch of them didn't get honorary degrees. But they changed the course of history -- and so can you ASU, so can you Class of 2009. So can you.

With a degree from this outstanding institution, you have everything you need to get started. You've got no excuses. You have no excuses not to change the world. Did you study business? Go start a company. Or why not help our struggling non-profits find better, more effective ways to serve folks in need. Did you study nursing? Understaffed clinics and hospitals across this country are desperate for your help. Did you study education? Teach in a high-need school where the kids really need you; give a chance to kids who can't-- who can't get everything they need maybe in their neighborhood, maybe not even in their home we can't afford to give up on -- prepare them to compete for any job anywhere in the world. Did you study engineering? Help us lead a green revolution -- developing new sources of clean energy that will power our economy and preserve our planet.

But you can also make your mark in smaller, more individual ways. That's what so many of you have already done during your time here at ASU -- tutoring children; registering voters; doing your own small part to fight hunger and homelessness, AIDS and cancer. One student said it best when she spoke about her senior engineering project building medical devices for people with disabilities in a village in Africa. Her professor showed a video of the folks they'd been helping, and she said, "When we saw the people on the videos, we began to feel a connection to them. It made us want to be successful for them." Think about that: "It made us want to be successful for them."

That's a great motto for all of us -- find somebody to be successful for. Raise their hopes. Rise to their needs. As you think about life after graduation, as you look into the mirror tonight after the partying is done -- that shouldn't get such a big cheer -- you may look in the mirror tonight and you may see somebody who's not really sure what to do with their lives. That's what you may see, but a troubled child might look at you and see a mentor. A homebound senior citizen might see a lifeline. The folks at your local homeless shelter might see a friend. None of them care how much money is in your bank account, or whether you're important at work, or whether you're famous around town -- they just know that you're somebody who cares, somebody who makes a difference in their lives.

So Class of 2009, that's what building a body of work is all about -- it's about the daily labor, the many individual acts, the choices large and small that add up over time, over a lifetime, to a lasting legacy. That's what you want on your tombstone. It's about not being satisfied with the latest achievement, the latest gold star -- because the one thing I know about a body of work is that it's never finished. It's cumulative; it deepens and expands with each day that you give your best, each day that you give back and contribute to the life of your community and your nation. You may have setbacks, and you may have failures, but you're not done -- you're not even getting started, not by a long shot.

And if you ever forget that, just look to history. Thomas Paine was a failed corset maker, a failed teacher, and a failed tax collector before he made his mark on history with a little book called "Common Sense" that helped ignite a revolution. Julia Child didn't publish her first cookbook until she was almost 50. Colonel Sanders didn't open up his first Kentucky Fried Chicken until he was in his 60s. Winston Churchill was dismissed as little more than a has-been, who enjoyed scotch a little bit too much, before he took over as Prime Minister and saw Great Britain through its finest hour. No one thought a former football player stocking shelves at the local supermarket would return to the game he loved, become a Super Bowl MVP, and then come here to Arizona and lead your Cardinals to their first Super Bowl. Your body of work is never done.

Each of them, at one point in their life, didn't have any title or much status to speak of. But they had passion, a commitment to following that passion wherever it would lead, and to working hard every step along the way.

And that's not just how you'll ensure that your own life is well-lived. It's how you'll make a difference in the life of our nation. I talked earlier about the selfishness and irresponsibility on Wall Street and Washington that rippled out and led to so many of the problems that we face today. I talked about the focus on outward markers of success that can help lead us astray.

But here's the thing, Class of 2009: It works the other way around too. Acts of sacrifice and decency without regard to what's in it for you -- that also creates ripple effects -- ones that lift up families and communities; that spread opportunity and boost our economy; that reach folks in the forgotten corners of the world who, in committed young people like you, see the true face of America: our strength, our goodness, our diversity, our enduring power, our ideals.

I know starting your careers in troubled times is a challenge. But it is also a privilege. Because it's moments like these that force us to try harder, to dig deeper, and to discover gifts we never knew we had -- to find the greatness that lies within each of us. So don't ever shy away from that endeavor. Don't stop adding to your body of work. I can promise that you will be the better for that continued effort, as will this nation that we all love.

Congratulations, Class of 2009, on your graduation. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

Members of the Board of Trustees, President White, Chancellor Herman, distinguished faculty, parents and friends, thank you. I'm truly honored to have been invested with a degree from this extraordinary university. And it is indeed an honor to speak especially to those whom we will know as graduates in a few minutes.

No doubt you are subconsciously settling in to hear yet another speaker admonish you to “think big” and to “make the world better than you found it.” In other times, these pieties might have been in order. These are not normal times; and this will not be a normal graduation speech. Its first characteristic will be its length. When Chancellor Herman called and asked me to do this, I said, "How long do I have to talk?" He said, "Oh, about 35 minutes." But, hey, I've got my degree. And, there's a recession underway, and we're all cutting back; so this speech will be a little shorter than that.

I'm going to start with a story. It's about the man who created our Foundation. Ewing Kauffman came of age in the Depression. His mother was so poor she had to leave the the family farm in Missouri and move to Kansas City to run a boarding house. When Mr. Kauffman graduated from high school, he went right into the Navy in World War II. When he got out, he worked for a drug company 'til he quit because he was too good a salesman. That’s right. Based on his commissions, he was out-earning the president -- two years in a row -- and when his territory was cut back the second time he quit -- claimed to himself he'd never work for anyone else again.

He became an entrepreneur. He started Marion Laboratories, a company that grew to be one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. Its first drug was invented by Mr. Kauffman himself, who had never been to college, after hearing his doctor-customers talk to him about what they thought were calcium deficiencies in pregnant patients. Mr. Kauffman developed a pregnant -- excuse me -- a calcium supplement by collecting oyster shells from Kansas City restaurants, extracting the calcium -- sometimes ruining his family’s washing machine -- and making it into pills. He did all this at night because in the daytime he sold these pills to doctors in their offices. He called his company Marion Laboratories -- it was his mother's name -- because he didn’t want his customers to suspect that his company only had one employee. Within a few years, it would have hundreds, and later thousands, and eventually tens of thousands.

As Mr. Kauffman grew older, he thought about how to give back to America, as a grateful citizen, for all the opportunity that it had provided to him. Like others, he conceived of a foundation as his way to say “thank you” to America. His philanthropic idea was revolutionary: The Kauffman Foundation might teach other people, many poor people, how to become entrepreneurs and to make their own economic destiny. In the bargain, as Mr. Kauffman saw, the American economy would grow stronger. Importantly, he also saw entrepreneurs as more likely to give back to others, just as he was doing, because America was the one place on earth where entrepreneurs could shape their future and then improve the world for others.

Mr. Kauffman’s foundation, which I am privileged to manage, began in 1993 with a gift of 700 million dollars from his estate. In the intervening years, we've given away about 1.5 billion dollars and today we're at least -- we're worth at least that much. When I hear the phrase, "Only in America" I am reminded of Mr. Kauffman and his foundation. You know, only in America do we have private foundations, like ours, that are living examples of the gratitude of successful citizens, and who voluntarily apply their fortunes to improving our nation’s civic life.

At Kauffman, we've learned much from studying how it is at the University of Illinois you seem to have such a high propensity to produce graduates who become entrepreneurs -- and successful entrepreneurs. And as you can see all around this campus by the names on many of the buildings, those who have gone before you have been very, very generous in their giving back to make this university grow stronger, and incidentally, to make your education a little cheaper. We should thank all of those who have given back to Illinois in this way.

Some of you might right now be thinking, making a little promise, forming a little commitment to yourself. It goes like this: “When I become rich, maybe as an entrepreneur, I’d like to give back to Illinois.” Or, “If I get really rich, maybe I’ll start a foundation.” Let’s consider how you might build a fortune that you could develop and give to improve human welfare. It’s going to be a little harder for your class, but it can be done.

As you know, and as the president has said, our nation is in recession. Some of you know its painful consequences; you can hardly find the job market, let alone a job. But as Americans, we tend to be optimistic -- in part because we know our history. We have faced adversity many times before, and we have always overcome. While the economy your -- your class faces is bad, let’s remember how much worse it was in the past, just as president White suggested a few minutes ago.

The classes of 1932 and 1933 faced the Depression with unemployment respectively at 23 and 25 percent. The classes of 1937 and '38 faced the overlooked “Second Depression” -- where unemployment was over 20 percent (incidentally, a recession -- a depression -- a second bounce of the Depression -- that didn't have to happen but did because of misdirected federal policy). And, things could be worse yet, than for those classes. Many in the classes of 1941 to '45 and the classes of 1951 and '52 were commissioned as part of their graduation ceremonies. They were called to both defend our nation and to regain the promise of freedom for all the peoples of the world. Eight hundred and fifty-five of those brave fellow alumni of yours never returned to look upon Alma Mater again.

And, we have had worse times even still. My class of 1968 faced the Vietnam War. In that year alone, 16,528 American were killed in uniform. Vietnam claimed the lives of 63 graduates of this university. And as president White has said, in 1980 and in 1981 and '82, the graduating classes faced what we had to call “stagflation.” The economy was shrinking. GDP was less than -- was negative 2 percent. Unemployment was over 10 percent. And worse, inflation was out of control with prices rising at [1]3.5 percent a year in 1980. Mortgage interest, by the way, ran as high as 15 percent, and the cost of medicine was rising at more than 18 percent a year.

So now that I've given you the basis for optimism -- Things could be a lot worse and yet American recovered -- let's turn to today's work. 

Your immediate task is to figure out what you will do with your career. And I am urging you to consider a vocation of entrepreneurship. You may not realize it, but wanting to become an entrepreneur is a much more common opinion -- option than many people think. More than 50 percent of graduating seniors today, this year, will already decide that someday they want to start their own business, work for themselves, and make the world a better place at their hands with their firm. The same holds true for those getting professional degrees, and for advanced degrees in the sciences as well. And at Illinois this number is higher than on the national average.

You know that this is one way where you can help yourselves and at the same time make an enormous contribution to society. The new companies that you will begin will create jobs, just as Mr. Kauffman's company did for his neighbors and for his communities. By starting a businesses, you will make new wealth and will enhance your communities. In time, like Mr. Kauffman, you will be able to share voluntarily the fortunes you have made to thank America for what it set in place for you today, in the past, and in the future. Are there other worthy things to do? Other worthy causes? Of course. Some of you, like me, will choose to work in the non-profit world. Before business even had a name, before we had invented the modern firm, the human family knew that charitable activity was the complete expression of love.

Many people see becoming an entrepreneur and working in the non-profit sector as life choices that couldn’t be farther apart. This view is not helped by graduation speakers who tell graduates that, to be a good person and to have careers that will provide meaning to their lives, they should do just about anything except work in the private sector in profit-making companies. Graduates are being told that a career in government is where they can do the most good; or that by working for NGOs they can accomplish something that “really matters”; or that working for a non-profit is what the best and the brightest of you should aspire to.

Indeed, there is such a thing, happily, as a non-profit entrepreneur -- someone who uses market forces, or learns from for-profit firms, how to do great things on a big scale without the profit motivation. This year, over 50 of your fellow alumnus, your classmates, have chosen to spend the first two years of their career in Teach for America. This private, non-profit organization will deploy about 3500 young men and women as part of a large-scale attempt to reform America’s public schools from the inside out. We, as citizens, should all be grateful to those folks from Illinois who will go into America's ghettos, and our poor schools, and devote themselve[s] to teaching kids in a way that teachers with your backgrounds are seldom able to do. 

It is the example of just this type of alumni going into non-profit work that prompts many people to smile and observe with approval that these are the graduates who must be "following their hearts.” But this discounts the thoughtful choice reflected in their decision to go forward for two years into America's ghettos and to Teach for America, or to work for similar, high-impact, non-profit organizations. And by the way, it implicitly suggests that if you choose a career in business you don’t have much of a heart. From my perspective, having worked both in business and in the non-profit sector, it seems to me that the call to service, be it in business or the non-profit world, is pretty much the same thing.

Speaking of service of others though -- to others, there are among you 43 young men and women who, tomorrow morning, will be commissioned as young officers in the the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and United States Marine Corps. In putting their very lives at risk to protect this wonderful country, they enter a different level of service altogether. We are grateful to you for your courage and readiness to protect us. And you grace your class and all of us with your example.

Apart from military service and perhaps service in the clergy, to suggest that a career in the non-profit world is intrinsically better or more virtuous or more honorable than working in business is to advance a false dichotomy. The choice that awaits you is not one between head and heart. Most likely the choice you make will be one where you satisfy your heart by using your head. Most of you will make your way into the private sector. You will be nurses, and lawyers, and professors, architects, scientists, designers, salespeople, and builders. You will work with for-profit firms. Your head, if you are like most people, will take you into business. And as millions of people before you have done, you will take your heart along with you.

Think about the people working in companies founded by Illinois graduates that make things that immensely improve our lives everyday: PayPal, Netscape, Safari, Delta Airlines, Black Entertainment Television, Oracle, and, of course, Mortal Combat. These companies help to make the world we enjoy. The people who work in them pour their hearts into their work for our benefit. And the entrepreneurs who thought them up directly contributed, with their initial ideas, to the quality of life we enjoy.

Any successful business reflects the combination of ideas joined with an important expression of love through service to other humans. It’s really how business works. Greedy bankers on Wall Street, abetted by corrupt politicians in Washington, cannot be allowed to operate as the poster boys of Congress [business].

Listen to President -- Listen to President Obama's words a few days ago at Arizona State [University], as he described the work of business leaders whom the President said we should "revere" not just respect. He says that they are the people who are involved in creating quality products and being committed to their customers, and being committed to the welfare of their workers, in seeking increase of wealth for their shareholders, and improving their communities. He is saying that service is the moral grounding of good business.

Consider the story of Chris Michel, someone I know well. He graduated from Illinois and served as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He saw that returning veterans needed help transitioning to civilian life. Among other things that Chris saw, was that the federal government’s bureaucracy was so clunky that good men and women couldn’t even get the benefits they had earned. Chris’s insight turned into a passion, and then it turned into a website, and then it turned into a company. Military.com was a great idea. It's helped millions of returning veterans. But Military.com is also an expression of love. There is no other way to see it. It was formed purely to help others.

Subsequently by the way, Chris has gone on as a serial entrepreneur to create a new company, Affinity Labs, which provides online job markets and peer-support communities for nurses, policemen, firefighters, and many other public service professionals. Chris, like Mr. Kauffman inventing drugs, is doing well by doing good. And Chris is using the power of a profit-making firms to reach and serve many more veterans than any similar non-profit assistance organization could ever hope to do.

I hope I have persuaded you to consider becoming an entrepreneur. For you, coming to this university -- where entrepreneurship seems to be part of the DNA around here -- you inherit this mantle. Becoming an entrepreneur should be a reasonable, perhaps even a self-evident, choice.

But there's another reason you must consider becoming an entrepreneur. America, right now, needs you. We need an army of the smartest, most passionate young people to try their hand at a business -- people who will take their hearts and their heads into the market, founding companies that will bring forth new products and services that will help mankind. The major problems of today -- global warming, better and cheaper health care, our scandalously bad public school system, and the decay of our cities -- all these are problems that to entrepreneurs should look like opportunities.

Why do we need more entrepreneurs right now? The entrepreneurs who create and run our businesses, who play by the rules, are in fact critical to our success as a nation. We need them especially today. First, we need them to solve the current crisis. Business, not government, will end this recession. Government must help by creating fair rules, sound monetary policy, and by protecting our fellow citizens in periods where they are jobless. But government has to stand to the side and let new entrepreneurial firms challenge companies that can no longer compete. We have to make way for the new entrepreneurial firms that will push us to frontiers of innovation. For example, we need new car companies, founded by engineers from the University of Illinois, who will give us safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient automobiles than Washington can design or that Detroit can build. One such company already exists. Many of you want to own a Telsa someday -- a Tesla --  excuse me -- someday. Martin Eberhard, who holds both his bachelor’s degree and his master’s degree from Illinois, is a cofounder of Tesla, which builds, as many of you know, the world's fastest, most beautiful electric cars.

Second, in addition to solving a recession, we need more entrepreneurs to continuously contribute to the expansion of human welfare through innovation. We need new kinds of products, revolutionary technologies such as YouTube, two of whose founders studied right here at Illinois. We need entirely new approaches to customer service, such as the one another Illini graduate, Tom Seibel, invented. Think about the contribution of the late Illinois professor Paul Lauterbur, who, by inventing the MRI, has saved countless lives and reduced morbidity for millions. You see, entrepreneurs, Illinois entrepreneurs, have made the world a much, much better place.

Third, entrepreneurs form the other half of the symbiosis between business and the non-profit sector. Without entrepreneurs and the new firms they create, they news jobs they make -- firms that create nearly all the new jobs in our economy every year -- we would have no new wealth to support either government or the charitable sector. Government can’t create wealth; non-profit organizations cannot create wealth. Only for-profit firms can create wealth, and with their taxes and the charitable donations of their employees secure our economy’s future for those who cannot be competent to operate in the market by themselves. And entrepreneurs are central to this process.

Finally, entrepreneurs play the key role in the drama of economic growth. It is entrepreneurs who are the ground-up force that helps us renew our society’s hope for tomorrow. New businesses are the outlet for a special kind of human creativity. They reflect the striving for human authenticity and commercial ways which benefit all mankind. In addition to bringing forth inventions and innovations that we didn’t even know we needed, entrepreneurs, by creating new jobs, provide expanding dignity to the human family. Entrepreneurs have always been the engine of economic renewal. It is they who renew democratic capitalism every time they choose to take the risk of starting a new company.

In America, economic growth has never been viewed as a happy accident. We have always sought growth and embraced the economic vitality that has made ours the economy that has grown more than any other in history. Growth, in America, has been the great alleviator of poverty, not just in the United States, but in large parts of the world. Growth has been the rationale for remaining open to talented and oppressed peoples from around the world. Growth has been the engine of social mobility. Growth has been the prerequisite for all of our progress in the sciences. Growth is the key ingredient in the glue that holds our society together.

And the only way to grow is to create -- new products, new services, new business models, new companies, new jobs, and new wealth. It is the entrepreneur’s personal and, at the same time, the entrepreneur's social mission. The foundation of our economy is the hundreds of thousands of businesses -- some of which will grow to be large; some of which will remain small -- that are formed every year. They create our new jobs. They bring forth the new and being a part of that story is a special form of community -- in national, and even international service. 

Not so incidentally, many of our most successful entrepreneurs have been first generation immigrants. This should not be surprising. The entrepreneurs of earlier times were all immigrants. To look at their success should be a lesson on why we must keep America an open and receptive land to the talent that the world sends here. I hope that in time our government will see the wisdom of encouraging the world's smartest talent to come here to study, to stay here, to become citizens, and to become part of this wonderful new generation of Americans who renew the promise of that all of us in America inherit; and to start the next generation of the world's most exciting businesses.

Your task is to form your class, your cohort into America’s most entrepreneurial generation in her whole history. I urge you to embrace it. Take all that you have learned here and bring it into business. Apply it to that idea sitting in the back of your mind. If you haven’t had that flash of inspiration yet, be patient. Julie Child didn't write her first book until she was 50. Harlan Sanders started Kentucky Fried Chicken with his first social security check. A big idea could be coming.

But maybe one won’t. You don’t have to be Bill Gates or Thomas Edison or Henry Ford to make a difference. Thousands of less famous entrepreneurs have done more than their part to enrich this country and their fellow citizens. Many have used their entrepreneurial talents inside existing businesses remaking companies like IBM and UPS. And thousands have provided the indispensable help to make entrepreneurial dreams reality in young companies and in established businesses.

Our future and the future of those happy children to come, to whom someday you will send greetings yourselves, depend on your entrepreneurial ambition, your passion, your knowledge, and your skill. The security of America and the job it still must play in the world to make democracy safe for all depends on your contribution to our economic growth. On behalf of all the generations that have gone before, who love this country and who love this university, we wish you nothing but the greatest of success.

Thank you.

Wow … Thank you … First thing I’ve got to tell you, I don’t want to disappoint anybody, but when you get a reception like this, I need to let you all know that Will Smith is not coming. This is as good as it’s going to get, right here.

I will also share with you that … you’re going to get to a point in your life where you have something called “people”. And these people who work for you and work with you, it’s their job to protect you from yourself. And what I mean by that is, on days like today, occasions such as this, they’re going to tell you what to say, and how to say it. And I will submit to you, that when that day comes in your life, and folks tell you what to say, the best thing for you to do after you take it into consideration, is to take it and go like this [rips up prepared speech] … And that felt good. That’s probably how some of your professors felt after reading your work. And you know what I’m talking about, I know you do!

I will share with you that I know perhaps I was not your first choice to give this address today, maybe I wasn’t the second choice, but I was the only one to return your call, OK? And out of all them other folk, I was probably the only one that could get here on public transportation. Some of them other folk, when you say BART, they probably think you’re talking about Bart Simpson.

I returned your call immediately and accepted because – a lot of folks don’t know this – but there was a point in time where being a working single parent with a 14 month old baby tied on my back, that my son and I slept on this campus. So for me to go from where I was to giving this address to you today, I kind of feel like it’s my graduation too. And it’s an honor to be here.

Before I say another word, I want to congratulate all the parents … the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, aunties, uncles, big brothers, big sisters … who helped all of us to to get here today. Because no one is going to walk across this stage today alone. Everybody got here today because somebody helped them. And I want to give a special shout-out to my fellow single parents. To all the fathers who had to be mothers, and all the mothers who had to be fathers. Because the best thing that ever happened to us as parents is you guys. And we are so proud of you.

And I want to tell you something else, I want you to consider it. There was somebody else who’s not here today who helped you get to where you are. I don’t know whether that person was a high school teacher, a counselor, or maybe it was someone who just worked in the school, who saw in you something that maybe at some point you didn’t see in yourself. And I want to ask you today to reach out to that person. Don’t call them. Go see them. Don’t email them, and whatever you do, do not Twitter, Tweet, or whatever that stuff is … Don’t do it. Go see them, shake their hands, hug them, laugh with them, cry with them, and say, “Thank you.”

And to all the folks who said you couldn’t do it, to all the folks who said you wouldn’t make it, you are perfectly justified to say, “How do you like me now?”

As a member of the class of 2009 graduates of UC Berkeley, I asked myself when I was trying to compose my thoughts, what would I want to hear from someone today? Would I want to hear more about the state of the economy, Wall Street bailouts, of the job market? No. I would like to hear from someone that, amidst all this chaos and turbulence, there’s an opportunity to create a new vision of the American Dream. That’s what I would like to hear from somebody today.

A new vision of the American Dream as great as any of the visions and dreams of our forefathers, founding fathers, and ancestors. A new vision of the American Dream that says: achieving balance in your life is more important than the balance in your checking account. A new vision of the American Dream where appreciation is greater than expectation. A new vision that says: for too long, a lot of us have been living in exile in a place called “things”, and it’s time for us to come home to friends, families, and folks. I submit to you today that this new vision of the American Dream means that what you do does not define who you are. A new vision that says: Do not confuse your net worth with your self-worth. A new vision that says: hey, stuff, toys and things exist, but they are not necessary for you to be happy. This vision I submit, [is] firmly rooted in the past, appreciative of today, but clearly focused on the future that we can choose to create.

And my last words to you today will be this: a lot of other folk will tell you that the sky is falling. I will not say that to you. I will not tell you that the sky is falling, I will say that those are pennies from heaven. And you know why I say that? Because I’ve seen this movie before, and I know how it turns out.

The last thing I will say to you today is this: All of my fellow classmates and graduates, you are in a position to go forward. And I encourage you, that whatever you do for the rest of your life, always Pursue Happyness, and you can Start Where You Are.

Thank you so much for having me here, Cal Berkeley. It’s been an absolute blast! Thank you! God bless you; thank you so much Cal Berkeley.

Well thank you so much and hello UT and I want to say congratulations to every single one of you that graduated today. I was listing to your names. I’ve been back there waiting for you to finish so I could start up.

Anyway, I know this is a big big day for you and I never dreamed, never ever ever dreamed, that I No problem, but making speeches I’m a little nervous, seriously. I’m nervous because I know that I am supposed to say something meaningful to you, maybe some good advice for you to always remember. Now I usually try not to give advice, information, yes, but advice, no but, what has worked for me may not work for you.

Well, take for instance what has worked for me. Wigs, tight clothes, push up bras, high heel shoes, five inch high heel shoes.All I got to say take my advices some of you boys out there may find yourself on a little different career path than you might have planned and you girls better be careful, too, seriously.

I wanted to tell you that the way I look is a country girl’s idea of glamour. It came from a very serious place. There was what you call a town trollop in our town, up in Sevierville. Well, I thought she was the prettiest thing I’d ever seen when I was a little girl and every chance I had to go to town, I’d see her and I would say “Oh she’s just so pretty.” and they’d say,“Oh she’s just trash.” I thought that’s what I’m going be when I grow up.

I know that sometimes I look like it but hopefully I’m a little more than that. I’d like to believe that there is a brain beneath all this hair and a heart beneath these, them. This entire moment reminds me of the first time I ever got up to sing on stage. Now I was just a kid and I was nervous then too and I wasn’t sure that I was going to be able to deliver what the audience wanted from me but I did sing and they did applaud. They did want more. Only trouble was they wanted an encore and I had only one song. So I just started up and sang the same song again.

Don’t you worry though because I’m not going to repeat this speech. I don’t care how much you like it.

But, seriously I remember, you know, all of that. It was a start for me. Of course today is a special day. Remember your parents today because at this moment, as you well know, they are as proud of you as they will probably ever be and they love you as much as they probably ever will. They’re all emotional.

Look at them, all teary-eyed.Seems to me like a good time for you to ask them for a loan. We got the smart bank up here. I’m sure they could help you out with that.

You know several years ago I created the Dollywood foundation. Now I know we wanted to do things to inspire kids but like all good organizations we needed the right mission to guide us and in the end what we came up with was pretty simple, straight forward and a wish for all kids. We wanted them to dream more, learn more, care more, and be more.

When I was thinking about what I should say to you today those four simple things just kept coming back to me.So I thought that I would use this as a way to share my thoughts with you. Governor Bredesen said a whole bunch of things that I was going to say but I didn’t know he was going to say them. So I’m going to say what I have to say because he was right on the money with a whole lot of things he said about me. I’m very grateful for my life but if I had but one wish for you it would be for you to dream more.

When I was a kid I use to put a tin can on a broom handle. I use stick it down in the crack out on the porch of our old cabin and of course in my mind’s eye I was standing on a stage with my guitar singing my heart out in this microphone and those were not chickens out there in the yard. It was my audience. That was no ragged dress that I was wearing. It was a dress all a glitter with rhinestones and it was made of the finest silk in my mind.So you have to stay true to your heart and to your dreams.

The night I graduated from Sevier County High School, back in 1964, we were all asked to stand up and talk about what we were going to do with the rest of our lives and everybody had a different story. When it came my time I stood right up there. I said I’m going to Nashville and I’m going to be a star. Well the whole place laughed out loud and I was so embarrassed, because I thought how odd. Why is everybody laughing, because that is what I’m going to do. As bad as I felt at that moment and as embarrassed as I was, it did not shake me from my dreams.So I guess I showed them, huh? You can do the same.

Of course you have to be careful. Do not confuse dreams with wishes. There is a difference. Dreams are where you visualize yourself being successful at what’s important to you to accomplish. Dreams build convictions because you work hard to pay the price to make sure that they come true. Wishes are hoping good things will happen to you but there is no fire in your gut that causes you to put everything forth to overcome all the obstacles.

So you have to dream more and never ever ever blame somebody else if it doesn’t happen. That is in your department. Yeah it’s true.You’ll see more of what I mean as you get out there in the big world. I still have dreams of what I want to do next and of course I hope that I will never retire. I will never go to seed and as they say I would certainly whether wear out than to rust out. I just hope that I drop dead right on stage one of these days, doing exactly what I want to do. I want people to just walk all around me and say oh just look at her. She’s smiling, she looks so happy but I hope it don’t happen today. That would not be good on your big day. If it happens just know I went happy, because this is what I do love to do.

If I had but one request of you, I ask that you learn more. Now when I was in school I only made average grades. Maybe it was because I dreamed too much about music and becoming a star. Or maybe I was paying too much attention to the boys. Or maybe I was just your typical dumb A and I know there are a lot of us out there. Anyway it took me a while to realize that the more you learn about everything, the easier it is to do it.

I thank God that when I was a kid my mother use to read the Bible to me and I learned to love reading when I was just a tiny little thing. I read everything I can get my hands on because it is my belief that if you can read, even if you don’t get a chance to get an education, you can learn about everything. Of course that was one of the reasons I wanted to work with the Imagination Library. So if you learn to read you can learn almost anything.

I also believe that to learn more means to keep working at making your dreams come true.

I know that I have truly been blessed but, I can tell you as the Governor did, that I have worked my country butt off to see those dreams come true. Nobody ever makes it without hard work.

Now working hard is not just effort. It’s learning. It’s trying new things and it’s about taking chances.

I got my first big start in Nashville, working for a man named Porter Wagoner. Now Porter had, yeah you know him. He was good to me. We went around and around. He had the best TV show, the most successful syndicated television show and we were one of the most popular duets ever in country music but I wanted to try new things.I wanted to write more songs, different music, and sing and try different things. Porter didn’t want that and neither did a lot of the so-called conventional wisdom.I knew that even if I fell flat on my face at least that I would know that I tried and that I would learn something from all that. I also knew at the time that given my size that if I did fall on my face it would take forever to get me up. Of course that’s a different story for a different crowd.

Goes back to that to that town trollop don’t it? Anyway the same was true when I started branching out into pop music, and even doing some dance music. People squawked and they complained and they had sworn that I had lost my mind. And I really wish that you all could have seen the look on my lawyer’s face 24 years ago when I told him I wanted to start a theme park and call it Dollywood. He thought I’d already taken the train to Crazywood.

I’m sure bunches of you have seen that dream come true for me and hopefully if you haven’t been to Dollywood you will get up there.Can you believe it, 25 years? Next year we’re going to do a special from up there. Maybe you’ll be back home and come up and see us. You know learning is all about taking chances, and as the Governor said, rolling up your sleeves and working hard. Now sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t but one thing is for sure. If you never try, you’re never going to win.

Now if I have but one favor to ask of you, it’s that you care more.Did you ever notice that there are a whole lot of people that do things just well enough to get by? Caring is about striving for perfection. It’s about how you look. It’s about how you prepare and how you keep your commitments.

The very first movie that I was ever in was called 9 to 5. As the Governor mentioned, that was thirty years ago when they did the movie. I wanted to be prepared. That was new territory for me. I think I over did it because I memorized the entire script. I thought it was like a play. I thought I had to know not only my lines but everybody else’s.

When I got there to do the movie everybody thought that was the funniest thing they ever heard of.

And I was too dumb to be embarrassed. Certainly after they started missing their lines on the set and I had the opportunity to say not it’s this it’s this it’s this. So at least I was prepared and in my business I truly love and respect everybody in my audience. I’ve always been so proud of my relationship with my fans. Of course it would just kill me to disappoint them for any reason because they pay my bills. I always think,“These fans are spending their hard earned money on me.” So it would just embarrass me, and hurt my feelings as well as theirs, for me to do a mediocre job. So I do my best at all times.

I hope that you will always care enough to be on time, to look your best and to always to give every task, and every job everything that you possibly have to give.

If you truly care for people you won’t judge them and then you will learn to appreciate the uniqueness in every single soul.

If I have but one hope for you, it is that you be more. People are always asking me, “What do you want people to say about you a hundred years from now?” I always say,“I want them to say ‘dang, don’t she still look good for her age?’”

All joking aside, I think people will remember us for who we were, not how many records we sell, or how much money we make because I have always said that I have always counted my blessings far more often than I’ve counted my money and my blessings are many. I have a loving family. I have a great hometown and obviously I live in the best state in the USA.Can I get a witness?

I also figured out a long, long time ago, it was not meant for me to have kids, so that everybody’s children could be mine. Now that’s a mighty big family, and a mighty big responsibility. The Imagination Library came from this place, from my desire to inspire the little kids to read and to learn. I just never dreamed that so many other generous souls, like rotaries, United Way, the state of Tennessee foundations, you name it, would invest their hard earned dollars into this effort and their kindness has helped us give away, since we started this whole program, 20 million books.That’s saying a lot.Governor we appreciate you for all that too.

The Governor and I have made a wonderful team. I love working with him. He’s become a buddy of mine, and every time I hear that he is going to be where I am I get so excited I try on about fifteen outfits so I can look good for you. I’m not joking. It’s true. Like Elvis, I comb my hair fifty-two different ways, thinking “the Governor’s coming, the Governor’s coming.”

Anyhow we’re very very proud of all the success of the Imagination Library, and I’m not saying this just to brag, because we’re all very proud. I’m telling this so you won’t make a mistake and kind of wind up like me, going from the cover of Playboy to being called the book lady. That’s a pretty far leap don’t you think?

I’m proud to be here.You know a loving person is a caring person and it’s hard to be bigger than that. Of course I always call that spiritual center that we all have inside us, I call that my God core. In a way it’s where heaven and earth meet. So you should always listen to that God core and care for others. Then you truly will be something special.

Now I know if my husband Carl Dean was here right now he would say “Haven’t you made these people suffer enough?” I would say “No, I have not made them suffer enough and I have not listened to you for 43 years. So why should I start now?”

Anyway I would have to say that Carl is probably right, and it’s time I do wrap this up. Actually my big moment in the sun is just a few minutes from now, because I’ve got to march off the stage, put on my black robe, which they had to tailor make for me because I’m so little. They were afraid I would kill myself on it. I’m not exactly Pat Summit, you know. So anyhow I’m going traipse off here in a minute and get ready for that. Try to get my little hat on if I can do all that and then come back out here and get my honor.

Thank you, President Cowan, Mrs. President Cowen; distinguished guests, undistinguished guests, you know who you are, honored faculty and creepy Spanish teacher. And thank you to all the graduating class of 2009, I realize most of you are hungover and have splitting headaches and haven’t slept since Fat Tuesday, but you can’t graduate ’til I finish, so listen up.

When I was asked to make the commencement speech, I immediately said yes. Then I went to look up what commencement meant which would have been easy if I had a dictionary, but most of the books in our house are Portia’s, and they’re all written in Australian. So I had to break the word down myself, to find out the meaning.

Commencement: common, and cement, common cement. You commonly see cement on sidewalks. Sidewalks have cracks, and if you step on a crack, you break your mother’s back. So there’s that. But I’m honored that you’ve asked me here to speak at your common cement.

I thought that you had to be a famous alumnus, alumini, aluminum, alumis; you had to graduate from this school. And I didn’t go to college here, and I don’t know if President Cowan knows, I didn’t go to any college at all, any college. And I’m not saying you wasted your time, or money, but look at me, I’m a huge celebrity.

Although I did graduate from the school of hard knocks, our mascot was the knockers. I spent a lot of time here growing up. My mom worked at Newcomb and I would go there every time I needed to steal something out of her purse. But why am I here today? Clearly not to steal, you’re too far away and I’d never get away with it.I’m here because of you. Because I can’t think of a more tenacious, more courageous graduating class. I mean, look at you all, wearing your robes. Usually when you’re wearing a robe at 10 in the morning, it means you’ve given up. I’m here because I love New Orleans. I was born and raised here, I spent my formative years here, and like you, while I was living here I only did laundry six times. When I finished school, I was completely lost and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I did everything

from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I’d just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn’t really have a plan, my point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I’m saying is, when you’re older, most of you will be gay. Anyone writing this stuff down? Parents?

Anyway, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and the way I ended up on this path was from a very tragic event. I was maybe nineteen, and my girlfriend at the time was killed in a car accident. And I passed the accident, and I didn’t know it was her and I kept going and I found out shortly after that, it was her. And I was living in a basement apartment; I had no money; I had no heat, no air, I had a mattress on the floor and the apartment was infested with fleas. And I was soul-searching, I was like, why is she suddenly gone, and there are fleas here? I don’t understand, there must be a purpose and wouldn’t it be so convenient if we could pick up the phone and call God and ask these questions.And I started writing and what poured out of me was an imaginary conversation with God, which was one-sided and I finished writing it and I looked at it and I said to myself, and I hadn’t even been doing stand-up, ever, there was no club in town. I said, “I’m going do this on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson” at the time he was the king “and I’m going be the first woman in the history of the show to be called over to sit down.” and several years later, I was the first woman in the history of the show, and only woman in the history of the show to sit down, because of that phone conversation with God that I wrote. And I started this path of stand-up and it was successful and it was great but it was hard because I was trying to please everybody and I had this secret that I was keeping, that I was gay. And I thought if people found out they wouldn’t like me, they wouldn’t laugh at me. Then my career turned into, I got my own sitcom, and that was very successful, another level of success. And I thought, what if they find out I’m gay, then they’ll never watch, and this was a long time ago, this was when we just had white presidents but anyway, this was back many years ago and I finally decided that I was living with so much shame, and so much fear, that I just couldn’t live that way anymore and I decided to come out and make it creative. And my character would come out at the same time, and it wasn’t to make a political statement, it wasn’t to do anything other than to free myself up from this heaviness that I was carrying around, and I just wanted to be honest. And I thought, “What’s the worst that could happen? I can lose my career”. I did. I lost my career. The show was cancelled after six years without even telling me; I read it in the paper. The phone didn’t ring for three years. I had no offers. Nobody wanted to touch me at all. Yet, I was getting letters from kids that almost committed suicide, but didn’t because of what I did. And I realized that I had a purpose. And it wasn’t just about me and it wasn’t about celebrity, but I felt like I was being punished and it was a bad time, I was angry, I was sad, and then I was offered a talk show. And the people that offered me the talk show tried to sell it. And most stations didn’t want to pick it up. Most people didn’t want to buy it because they thought nobody would watch me.Really when I look back on it, I wouldn’t change a thing. I mean, it was so important for me to lose everything because I found out what the most important thing is, is to be true to yourself. Ultimately, that’s what’s gotten me to this place. I don’t live in fear, I’m free; I have no secrets and I know I’ll always be ok, because no matter what, I know who I am. So In conclusion, when I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought when I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars, I want to have groupies. To quote the Pussycat Dolls. How many people thought it was “boobies”, by the way? It’s not, it’s “groupies”.

But my idea of success is different today. And as you grow, you’ll realize the definition of success changes. For many of you, today, success is being able to hold down 20 shots of tequila. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure to try to be something that you’re not, to live your life as an honest and compassionate person, to contribute in some way. So to conclude my conclusion, follow your passion, stay true to yourself. Never follow anyone else’s path, unless you’re in the woods and you’re lost and you see a path and by all means you should follow that. Don’t give advice, it will come back and bite you in the ass. Don’t take anyone’s advice. So my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine.

And I know that a lot of you are concerned about your future, but there’s no need to worry. The economy is booming, the job market is wide open, the planet is just fine. It’s going be great. You’ve already survived a hurricane. What else can happen to you? And as I mentioned before, some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most. And now you know the right questions to ask in your first job interview. Like, “Is it above sea level?” 

So to conclude my conclusion that I’ve previously concluded, in the common cement speech, I guess what I’m trying to say is life is like one big Mardi Gras. But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain, and if they like what they see, you’ll have more beads than you know what to do with and you’ll be drunk, most of the time. So the Katrina class of 2009, I say congratulations and if you don’t remember a thing I said today, remember this, you’re going to be ok, dum de dum dum dum, just dance.

Hello, little dragons. Congratulations! You are now free from your 12 years of Knowledge-Prison. Today you begin the next phase of your life — whether it’s college, a job, or a program abroad — where you build a schoolhouse for underprivileged children, while hooking up with each other.

The main difference for you, between life yesterday and life tomorrow, is you can go to the bathroom whenever you want. It’s a pretty big responsibility, but you’ve earned it. A few more things: you can vote, start a family, go to war, even buy a beer. Just kidding, you’re only mature enough to shoot our enemies in the face.

Your parents are proud of you, but they’re nervous — 2009 is very different from when they grew up — most of them still remember exactly where they were when Lincoln was shot.

But here we are today — amidst several wars, with history’s largest deficit, in the worst recession since families gathered around radios to learn about evolution. On behalf of the generations who came before you, we’re really, really sorry. We made some oopsyies.

I won’t lie to you, there is an asteroid heading for the earth and you only have four days to live. I’m sorry, where was I?

Oh yeah, it will be up to you to lead America into the future. And I don’t mean your generation. I mean the 326 of you. You alone must fix the whole world. Tonight — relax, celebrate — have some Manischewitz. Tomorrow, start fixing.

Good news! This is the point in the graduation speech where I tell you a personal anecdote about perseverance and then quote a song. What’s the worst grade you’ve ever gotten? A D? An F? When I was in eighth grade at Diamond Middle school, on a homework assignment, I once got a -8. I did my assignment worse than not doing it. But did I let getting a grade lower than the lowest possible grade stop me? No. I was put into Recourse Room (Special Education) and turned my F into a D.

So, you see, sometimes you can fail, then barely pass, and then become a comedian. Also, I recommend being on television occasionally, because people treat you nicely.

Lastly, some tips for life  —

Don’t forget to follow your dreams — unless your dreams are stupid — like eating all the cake in Arlington.
Be kind to people.
Don’t get too excited when you read the Fountainhead.
In this time of recession, it is the time for invention. Did you know both the telephone and the automobile were invented during recessions? So was “talking dirty.”
Things can kill you. So just keep that in mind, you fearless-know-it-alls.
Good luck with everything and don’t become addicted to heroin, unless you want to be a great songwriter.

And now, as promised, I’ll quote a song. Garden Party by Rick Nelson. It’s about him getting booed off stage at Madison Square Garden in 1971:

“it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well.
You see, ya can’t please everyone, so ya got to please yourself
lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah”

Thank you so much, Michael. Thank you Madame President. I gather that there is a Bates College tradition of staying up all night before this morning. I can tell why so many of you have dark glasses on even though there is no sun. I must have been a Batesie in a previous life, because the night before my college graduation, I fulfilled this Bates College tradition, but alas did not make it to my commencement ceremony, so I am deeply impressed by all of you being here today.

It’s a little bit tough for me despite those very kind words that Michael Chu said. I’ve never really thought of myself as being at the advice-giving age yet. I find this a little more difficult to do than one would imagine.

There’s this wonderful scene in Woody Allen’s Radio Days. The young Woody Allen is listening to the radio and the mother is horrified to see this. The mother says, “Stop listening to the radio. It’s going to ruin you.” This was in the day that people thought that Cole Porter and Gershwin were bad for your moral health. Woody Allen looks at her and says, “But Ma, you listen to the radio all day. ” And she says, “Ah, that’s different. My life is ruined already.”

My life is not quite ruined yet, so I’m a little reluctant to give you advice. We face a difficult period for those of us out in the world. Art Buchwald once gave a very short graduation speech. He said, “Ladies and gentlemen. We’re leaving behind a perfect world. Don’t screw it up.”

I think it’s difficult for any of us to make that claim to you right now. We are going through a very difficult time. Whether it is geopolitically or economically, clearly these are awkward and difficult moments for you to graduate in to. But let me tell you why I remain very optimistic, and this is the short message I want to leave you with.

I remain extremely optimistic about the world you are going into and your opportunities because of you. This entirely relates to change, something Geena Davis began talking about. Let me give you one example. About a month ago, the World Health Organization declared that there was a global pandemic relating to swine flu and warned that there would be deaths probably in the hundreds of thousands. As of now we have had as many deaths and confirmed infections as from a normal seasonal case of influenza. Why is that?

Is it because we all panicked and got it wrong? No, the swine flu had many characteristics of a virus that led one to be very troubled. But what happened was that the World Health Organization issued its warning and people acted. People acted fast and energetically, particularly fast and energetically in the epicenter of the crisis, in Mexico. The Mexican government basically quarantined everyone who had the disease, inoculated those who it could, provided drugs for most people, which was the most effective treatment. Most importantly, it shut down its areas of common meeting places, shut down its economy for virtually three weeks in order to stop the progress of this flu. It seems that by doing that they largely stopped the virus in its tracks.

The point I’m trying to make is that we can all very easily describe the problems that the world faces — economic, environmental, geopolitical — but what is always very difficult to describe is the human response to the problems. In the 1760s, an English clerk, Thomas Malthus, predicted that England would run out of food and that its population would starve in a famous essay called, “The Essay on Population.” Malthus was entirely right in describing the problem. He did not understand the human response. England invented an agricultural revolution, then an industrial revolution, went on not simply to feed its people but a large part of the world.

If you look at the current economic crisis, we can all describe all the problems we face. But it is very difficult to know what you will do in response to it. What we will do in response to it. What government will do, what industry will do, what nonprofit organizations will do, and how the collective human response will thus change history.

If you look at the last 200 or 300 years, it is a story of challenge and response. And it is much easier to describe the structural challenges we face than to describe the human response to those challenges that will change history.

So if you ask what the future holds, I don’t know because I don’t know what you will do. And it really is up to you to decide what you are going to do. But you will do something because in every small way that you act, you act as productive economic beings, as moral beings, as social beings, and in all those actions, when collected together you change history.

That is my simple message to you. Recognize that you are the change you seek. You are the great agents of change in the world. When you look at all these forces — the rise of China, the rise of India — whatever it is, remember you can adapt to them. You can embrace them. You can respond to them in ways that will better your life, better the life of your society. You cannot ignore them. You cannot fight them. But what you can do is adapt and make the world a better place.

It is an extraordinary moment to be coming into the world because in the first time in human history people around the world are achieving some level of human dignity in terms of their rise out of poverty. If you would have asked me 30 years ago how many countries were growing at 4 percent a year, that number would have been about 30. Today it is about 130. You have an extraordinary new world out there with all kinds of human talent being unleashed.

To have that money people consuming, producing, investing, dreaming, singing, praying — this has to be a good thing. It’s a world that is ultimately going to have many more opportunities than the world I grew up in and that my parents grew up in.

What does this mean in terms of what industry you should go into? I don’t know. I don’t know whether nanotechnology or biotechnology is the wave of the future. I don’t know if you should become investment banks or artists. Investment banking isn’t looking so hot these days though.

But I will tell you something very simple and obvious, which is that it is likely that human beings will find fulfillment and will be rewarded for the same qualities that they have been rewarded for for 5,000 years. And that is intelligence, hard work, honesty, a sense of character, loyalty to family and friends, and above all love and faith.

If you are trying to decide what you should do, those are the things you should do. And you know it. The difficult thing is acting on them. I leave you with that simple advice. If you are trying to figure out what to do in the future, for 5,000 years people have built statues to men and women who have had those characteristics. They are likely to do the same, or they won’t build statues anymore. They’ll build weird modernist pieces of art, mobile sculptures with strange do-dads on them. You get the general point.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Class of 2009, God speed.

Good morning Class of 2009, parents and family, faculty, alumnae, and trustees.

It is an honor to be up here talking to you today, at the college where I learned so much about life, the world, and myself.

This place is very meaningful for me, not just because of my own history, but for what it continues to do for hundreds of women every year — the exceptional class sitting where I sat 16 years ago, and for all of the women who have come before us and for all the women who will follow.

It always seems strange in life to come back to a place where so many things began. I vividly remember my graduation day, a warm spring morning filled with family and friends, flowers, and photos. Parking tickets still to be paid and some last minute hole patching to do in my dorm room (I confess that my toothpaste wasn't exclusively used on my teeth that day).

That afternoon, the next chapter of my life began as I drove off in my Ford pickup truck with a 1946 German motorcycle loaded into the bed. I had received a Fulbright Scholarship to study the Old Colony Mennonites in Chihuahua, Mexico, but a couple of months earlier I had an epiphany that I wanted to become a farmer.

So, I arrived back home in Tucson nine hours later knowing that I would be starting summer school economics at the University of Arizona the next morning. I was convinced this would be just the coursework I would need to solve world hunger.

Seven decades ago, a woman named Ellen Browning Scripps, whom we will never know, had in mind exactly this kind of lunacy when she founded our college, in 1926.

Scripps, you see, is not just a place but an idea: "The paramount obligation of a college is to develop in its students the ability to think clearly and independently, and the ability to live confidently, courageously and hopefully."

Many things have changed for me since I received my Scripps diploma, but what Scripps taught me about my life and how to live it remains today.

On the plane out here this morning, I reflected on my last week in Congress:

As the first woman chair of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, I needed to be at the shuttle launch, where we have sent a crew of highly trained astronauts to perform needed repairs on the Hubble telescope;

Wednesday night was a late one — out at sea at 2 a.m. observing a Navy SEAL hostage rescue exercise to better understand how to combat piracy;

Questioning our Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff in my House Armed Serviced Committee about DOD's plans to deal with the fighter jet shortfall;

And if I look a little sunburned, it's because yesterday I participated in the reburial of Tucson Civil War soldiers by escorting their remains on a two-hour ride along with 200 freedom-loving, leather- and patch-wearing, Harley Davidson-riding Veterans of Foreign Wars motorcyclists. Yes, mom, I did wear sunscreen.

Another highlight from last week was when I finally met Scripps President Fritz Weis and Roxanne Wilson, chair of the Board of Trustees, along with various other Scripps alumnae. We were gathered for a beautiful black-tie evening in Washington, where a Scripps graduate, Ruth Owades, was being awarded the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Award.

How could a woman born in the 1800s have prepared me for all of that?

It is truly remarkable that our Scripps founder, herself an entrepreneur and philanthropist, understood fundamentally the challenges and the splendor that life affords us. She created this wonderful college for exactly that purpose — a place to learn, to think, to explore, and to grow. A foundation we can return to again and again for inspiration.

Graduates, I am going to be honest with you: I don't remember a lot about my graduation speeches, whether my high school, here at Scripps or Cornell University — although if one of my speakers would have mentioned telescopes, pirates, and bikers all in the same speech, I would have remembered that!

So, let me tell you something that is totally obvious: You are now at the termination point of one of the best educations the United States has to offer.

You have spent a few glorious years receiving enormous gifts of knowledge and discipline. In my case, I learned what an Existentialist was and why I didn't want to become one. In astronomy, I learned about black holes (which still freak me out — if anyone has seen the recent Star Trek movie, you will know exactly what I mean) and after not caring much for math in high school, at Scripps I learned to become passionate about calculus.

I learned about war for the first time, staying up late at night listening to the coverage of Operation Desert Storm and witnessing student rallies and peace demonstrations. I learned about natural disasters and community response because of the California earthquakes of the early 1990s.

Some of these lessons were part of the school's curriculum and some were not. But all of these lessons were gifts.

With great gifts come great expectations. We are here today — your professors, your parents, your friends — we all expect you to go out into the world and be restless and creative and inspiring with all that you have been given.

But there is something else among the most important responsibilities for women today, something that Ellen Browning Scripps did not talk about, to the best of my knowledge, probably because she was up to her ears fighting for some of the most basic women's rights here in America, but I just know that she would mention if she were with us today.

She would expect and want that most elusive thing for you: to be happy, to find contentment in this life that we have that is far too fleeting.

It may be that you will spend this gift of life in pursuit of scientific discovery, making great art, growing our nation's economy, or bringing relief to the world's poor.

It may be that you will find the calling of your heart inside the creation of a loving family. Whatever it is that is calling to you, I urge you to ignore the voices that are telling you what you ought to do with your career and your family choices.

You cannot authentically live anyone's life but your own. That is the deal life offers us.

We as women have fought too hard and for too long against the narrowing confines of social expectation to have anything less.

Here at this wonderful point in your lives today, this hatching into your future, it is now time for you to embrace what was denied those who came before — it is now time to follow the passion inside your heart and listen to its voice above all others.

And what it says to you in the years ahead may surprise you and invert the notions of how you thought your life would turn out.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being confounded like this, especially in your early twenties.

That is part of the adventure of growing older — and growing deeper into your own skin as women, or as the wonderful poem goes: WARNING, when I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.

So yes, I am saying being happy is more than just something to hope for. It's something to expect.

When you do this, when you tune out the critical voices in your head and embrace what your heart is saying, you don't just make your own life better. You make the world better.

Let me give you an example: One of the most powerful transformations in my own life happened when I was about to leave graduate school.

I had worked hard for my degree in regional planning from Cornell University and had been offered a high-paying job in New York City with a top eight accounting firm. It seemed like the beginning of a grand and glittering adventure in the big city: posh apartments, pointy-toed shoes, and maybe even my first martini.

But then an unexpected phone call came from my father, who needed me to come home to help him manage my family's tire and automotive business.

This was completely unexpected and not at all in my cosmopolitan plans. Inevitably, there comes a point in all of our lives where our role as the child begins to reverse with our parents. Our protectors now need protection.

For some of us, it comes while we are established in life, and for others it may come while we are young. But whenever that call comes, early or late, we pick up the phone and we respond.

In my case, it meant packing up my heels and putting on my cowboy boots, getting back into that same old Ford pickup truck and heading back West.

Like my microeconomics course years earlier, I started out the first morning back in Tucson, but this time out in the tire shop, learning the business from guys named Chuy and Frank. I learned the tire business from the ground up and also started to manage the company's philanthropic aims, the part that tried to give back to the community that had been so generous to us through the years.

I started to see things about Southern Arizona that were not perfect and needed to change. So I ran for office determined to make that change and put right things that were wrong and represent those who didn't have a voice.

And I realized then and there what my heart was saying: that for me, the highest calling in my own life was service to others. I have not looked back since.

When that moment of realization dawns on you — as it eventually will, with its own unique message — I encourage you also to seize it and not look back.

Do not focus your energies on making a living. That will come, I promise you.

It will come almost as an accident, as a byproduct, without your even having to think about it.

You are blessed to be living in a country that gives its citizens the freedom to bump around the scenery a bit, to try new things and make mistakes and stretch your talents and make adjustments and to find every rich and satisfying thing, and it will still be okay in the end.

Remember what the authors of the Declaration of Independence said about the inalienable rights of each person, which are "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."

Think of that! Those words are one of the deepest expressions of who we are as Americans. This is the mission statement of the United States.

I hope you will choose to make it your own mission statement as well.

Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism.

You should do what you were put here to do — that is the most certain key to success and happiness.

Some of the most miserable people I have ever met — both in and out of politics — have been people who chose their careers based on its level of salary or prestige.

They focused on the externalities, at the expense of what truly made them happy inside. This is exactly the wrong way to make a life for yourself.

It leaves you empty and thirsty at the end of it, and does no good for those who are close to you and those in your community. Material things never satisfy. Find what it is that you love and pursue it with courage and confidence.

All of the great writers and musicians and scientists throughout history had to understand this before they could make their marks.

Nobody ever made a breakthrough creating bland and safe repetitions of what others had done before them.

No, the material that is really revolutionary and path-breaking always comes from what is strange and unconventional within the subconscious.

This is a profoundly individual act, and it takes great courage to take a gamble on what seems counterintuitive and even a little bit odd to those around you.

Let me say a little more about the courage to follow your heart.

You have spent several years here learning how to speak a foreign language, and solve for X, and maybe the right spot to place a penalty kick and the valence number for manganese.

More importantly, you have also been required to take a Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Humanities, where you have been challenged with readings and lectures and discussion about Culture, Knowledge, and Representation.

What Scripps forced you to grapple with was a peeling back of the human onion in order to discover the supreme value of the soul and how crucial it is to maintain personal integrity and honesty.

I can assure you that these aren't just abstract concepts meant to apply only to the rich or the powerful or the fictional. These apply to every single person, and they will surely apply to you before very long in a way that you perhaps will not expect.

There will be many, many times in the course of your professional and personal lives where you will be encouraged — in shockingly plain ways — to take the easy way, to go along with the group in contradiction to your own principles.

You will one day be standing in the shoes of Faust, most likely somewhere on one of the jobs that you take.

But the safety of the world, in some sense, depends on your saying "no" to inhumane ideas.

Standing up for one's own integrity makes you no friends. It is costly. Yet defiance of the mob, in the service of that which is right, is one of the highest expressions of courage I know.

A supreme value of education is the understanding that the group consensus is not always right, in fact, that it can be totally wrong and must be subject to thoughtful challenge and questioning.

It is my hope for this graduating class that you will be among those self-assured enough to make personal sacrifices for what is right.

So, be passionate. Be courageous. Be strong.

If you remember these things, you will make me proud of you, you will make Scripps proud, you will make your parents proud, and you will make the United States proud of you and grateful for the unique treasures you will give to it.

Congratulations.

Man did you pick a great time to go out and get a job. I mean come on, it's the elephant in the room, right? I want to know, honestly, how many of you are a little bit freaked out about trying to go out and get a job right now? I know I would be - actually the group looks a lot more confident then I would have been, so - confident group. I'm impressed. Hopefully some of the things we're going to talk about this morning may be helpful. I'm hoping that they are. I'd like to thank Dean Wilson. I'd like to thank Larry Gross for inviting me here today and I want to congratulate all of you on your great accomplishment - it's fantastic.

I love USC. My oldest daughter Katrina is a grad from SC - class of 2007. I love the Annenberg school and I'm proud to be on the Board of Counselors; you picked a great school to go to. Now Larry Gross ordered me to keep my comments to 10 minutes or under. And the only question anyone asked me here today - and I was asked repeatedly by the other people on the dais, was - 'how long is your speech?' So I get it. I began my career as a disc jockey when I was 15 years old so I understand timing - a little bit. But because of that restriction on time there are a lot of things I'm not going to be able to tell you about. I'm not going to be able to tell you about the time I set myself on fire drinking flaming shooters at MTV. My career playing records at a strip club in Indianapolis. The time I got into a big fight with some very angry lesbians because I hired Howard Stern at E!. And my daughter last night - I was kind of going through this practicing last night - and my daughter said 'Oh! You gotta tell them about the time you got thrown out of the Halcyon Hotel in London with The Cure!' But we don't have time for those! All those stories are better told over cocktails anyway and not at a solemn occasion like this.

I'm gonna try avoiding the cliches one regularly hears at these commencement speeches about following your passion, striving for greatness, making a difference - all those things - they're true. I believe them all. I'm just guessing - just guessing - that you've heard these before and you don't need me repeating them. So what I'm going to do is tell you three very short stories about my life and career, and three themes that were helpful to me. Maybe they'll be relevant - maybe they'll be helpful to you. And some of them are things that we usually don't talk about in polite company. Although some of them were actually referenced by your valedictorian who was terrific this morning - he was great, as was the Governor.

The three themes: dumb luck, crushing failure and delusions and self-deception. I mentioned earlier I began my career as a disc jockey when I was 15 years old. I worked at this rinky-dink little radio station in Doylestown, Pennsylvania - it was in the middle of a cow pasture. We have some Doylestonians! My first job was playing religious tapes on Sunday from the churches and the local preachers. And every half hour I got to do a station identification. I would clear my throat, I'd open the microphone and in my massive 15-year-old voice I'd say "WBWex Doylestown". I made many mouse sound masculine.

Eventually the station grew desperate enough to have me fill in as a disc jockey and play records. I was horrible. I was dreadful. One day the General Manager of the radio station called me into his office - very kindly, very gently told me, I might want to think about pursuing a different career. Of course I thought I was fantastic. I used to listen to the radio stations in New York, I used to listen to the stations in Philadelphia and I knew I was better than - or just as good as the people on the air there. I was totally delusional. Everybody knew it, except me. I told everybody I knew that I was going to be a disc jockey at one of those big New York radio stations by the time I was 25. People could not hide their amusement or their laughter, which only pissed me off and made me try harder. And ultimately I did improve. When I was 25 I was hired for an afternoon show at WNBC in New York - one of the big stations at the time. I was never really that great, but I was good enough and I got there. Had I known how truly terrible I was when I was 15 I would have never tried. And that is what has convinced me of the power of big goals. I believe that if people are not laughing at your ambitions and your goals, then your dreams are not big enough.

My second story is about dumb luck. A couple of years ago I was having dinner with a group of friends of mine that are all very successful CEOs. Someone in our group asked if any of us had had one lucky break - one lucky break that was responsible for the beginning of our various successes. Everyone of us had a story. My story was about offering a friend of mine - this was when I was a disc jockey in Louisville, Kentucky of all places - from a competing radio station, he needed a place to stay until he got his own apartment. And I said 'sure, why not.' One evening he was out, the phone rings, I answered it, it was a long-distance call, it was a friend of his from another city. It turned out to be a young program director from a radio station in Pittsburgh. I struck up a conversation with him. We ended up becoming friends and we would speak regularly on the phone. The guy was Bob Pittman. He went on to great success. Four years after that phone call when we met, he hired me at the station I was telling you about in New York - at WNBC. And nine years after that he hired me to run VH1 and then MTV. We've been friends for 37 years, and it all happened because I let a friend crash at my apartment. (laughs) Everyone in our group of 10 CEOs had a story something like that, and I asked the group 'what would have happened if that specific accident - that specific stroke of luck - had not occurred?' Some of the people felt that if it wasn't that stroke of luck, it might have been another. Others weren't so sure. I'm kind of in that camp. But I will tell you, I've been lucky because I've had a series of great strokes of luck in my life and my career. The moral of the story - if one of your competitors needs a place to stay, let them. And if the phone rings, answer it!

Now I want to talk about crushing failures. A few months ago I was having drinks with an investment banker friend of mine who had just been laid off. She was very upset - she'd never been laid off before. She had said 'I have never failed at anything' - graduated top of her class. So of course, being the empathetic guy I am, I'm starting to chuckle a little bit. This just upset her more. And I said look 'I have never been laid off - I have never been part of a workforce reduction.' And she was stunned - she says, 'why are you telling me this?' And I said, even though I've never been laid off, I have been fired. I've been singled out - they said 'everyone else, you can stay, but you - you go. And don't darken our doorway again.' It's happened to me three times! This instantly made her feel better.

The first time I was fired I was 23, not much older than most of you - I was working at a radio station in Miami - Y100 - I'd only worked there for three months; I didn't fit in, I didn't sound like the rest of the station - they should have never hired me, I should have never taken the job, but there I was. I was fired. I was devastated. I had never failed before. It was soul crushing. I felt horrible.

I ended up moving back to Louisville, Kentucky where I had been working before to take a job at an even smaller radio station just so I could be near my friends and be back in my comfort zone. About three months later, at that station, they offered me a program director's job and that was my entrance into management and I realized then that I was actually better in management than I was on the air. And three years after that, the owners of the station offered me the chance to become business partners with them. We went on over the next seven years to build a group of small radio stations that we owned. It would have never happened had I not been fired in Miami.

My other big failure - one of the three - in 1989 when I was running MTV, I put the raunchy comedian Andrew Dice Clay on the MTV Music Awards. He promised he was going to keep it clean. He didn't. We got the highest ratings the show had had up to that point, and I lost my job. Thanks Andrew.

Again I was devastated. I loved running MTV. It was a hoot. I had a blast. And a huge part of my identity - the way I thought about myself was wrapped up in that job. It crushed me. But about two days later I got a phone call from some of the folks at HBO. They wanted me to run a cable channel that was then called Movietime. They'd been trying to fill the job for nine months - no one would take the job. But I was desperate. I wanted a CEO job and they gave me an ownership stake so I took the job. I moved out to Los Angeles and we launched - eh, we relaunched the channel as E! - Entertainment Television. I ended up staying there for nine years, we grew it into a hugely valuable business and it was a career-maker for me - I had a ball. I would have never done it if I hadn't been pushed out of MTV. So I've learned that as painful as it is, failure has been my friend. And it can be your friend too! Actually, someone is writing it down here - that's good; put it in your wallet.

I promised Dean Wilson and Larry Gross that I would keep it short, so I'm going to wrap it up. I think we can all agree right about now you have the attention span of a spider monkey on meth. I promised you three stories and I promised I'm going to give you three wishes and no the first wish can't be unlimited wishes. The first wish is that you get boundless amounts of dumb luck; though I suspect that the luck you get will be luck that you've earned. You've already made at least one great decision and that was choosing USC and the Annenburg School. The USC network is legendary; your friends, your classmates, alum, faculty - they're all going to be of great help to you if you'll let them. By coming here, you've upped your odds of being lucky. That's true. I hope you recognize that good luck when it's presented to you and that you exploit it to the fullest extent allowed by law. My second wish is that you have no failures. Now this is highly unlikely. Because I told you failure has been my friend, I have a funny feeling it could be yours. But it's never fun - it never is. So when you have your failures I hope that they aren't devastating and that you're able to weather them well. And that you use them as catalysts and springboards to even better opportunities. And finally, I wish for you to be crazy, delusional and wildly outrageous in the way you see yourself. You saw Arnold Schwarznegger - Dr. Schwarzenegger speak this morning about this subject - I don't know if you ever saw the film "Pumping Iron" - it's fabulous - you look and you think this guy is going all the way. He's going all the way. He had a big vision for himself. He conquered body building, he conquered acting. He's now the governor. Will he conquer the budget?!

The great American philosopher, Gene Simmons of Kiss - my personal mentor - said "Life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself." Yes he really said that. So my last wish is that your ideas and your schemes and your plans are so big that everyone laughs, but that you get to have the last laugh. I'm rooting for you.

Thank you, Chancellor Tseng... Aloha! Distinguished guests, faculty, graduates, and the ohana of the graduating class of 2009.

Congratulations to the graduating class! You've reached the end of a long and rigorous journey. You've completed your last final exam, wrapped up your last soil analysis, and finished your dissertation on Hawaiian poetry. And now, following this milestone occasion of your graduation, you get to dream like the rest of us -- you know, the kind of dream where you show up to your English lit class for the first time of the semester and the professor asks everyone to get out their pencils for the final exam.

I'm very honored to be the last person you hear from before you walk across this stage to receive your hard-earned diplomas. I'd imagine that the university invited me to speak here today not only because I'm a part-time Hawaii resident, but because they took pity on me. You see, the idea for Yahoo! was born when I was procrastinating my PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford in 1994... and the company took off before I had a chance to finish my degree. So I never actually earned my Ph.D. And that I will receive Honorary Doctorate today -- without even setting foot in a lab -- is quite amazing. Mahalo!

My job here today is to spend about 10 minutes or so to share some of my personal stories with you, so you can go on to do great things with your new degrees, and in your lives. I'd like to do that with a few bullet points of advice:

Point one: Don't let the news get you down.
Let me read you some headlines: "College Grads Labor Against Shrinking Job Market Openings, Drop 13% This Year." And, "America Broadens its Deployments in the Middle East." And "U.S. Taxpayers To Spend Billions Bailing Out Failing Financial Institutions."
Now, you might think that's today's headlines. In fact, that was in the year 1990, when I sat where you are now for my graduation. The future looked pretty bleak. Some people may say that I took the "easy way out" -- I went to graduate school -- but the reality was I couldn't find a job with an engineering degree from Stanford!

So get out there, go see the world, chart your own footprints on different lands than you are familiar with! ...It's really hard to dream if you can't imagine the possibilities. 
But the point is that great things will come in times of adversity. So it all comes down to your outlook. Mark Twain once defined an optimist as "a person who travels on nothing from nowhere to happiness."
I can promise you that great things are being started in down-times like this. Yahoo! started in an economic downturn in the early 90s. Other great companies, great ideas, products, even social movements have come about as people were throwing away the status quo and doing EVERYTHING in new ways. In some ways, there's not a better time to be a graduate to be part of this renewal.
Point two: You get out of life what you put into it.
Success doesn't come from a high IQ or innate talent. It takes a willingness to work hard. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, he introduced the "10,000 hour rule," which holds that it takes about 10,000 hours of hard work and practice -- or ten years -- to become a world-class expert in anything. The difference between a good violinist and a virtuoso comes down to ambition and having the discipline to put in the requisite time. As someone once said, in golf as in life, it is the follow through that makes the difference.

My mother taught me the rules of perseverance. While I've certainly faced challenges since founding Yahoo!, they were nothing compared to what my mother faced coming to the US as a single parent from Taiwan, with two young boys and a few suitcases. I was ten at the time, and the only English word I knew was the word "shoe." It could have been very easy to feel discouraged. But I worked hard, studied hard, and played hard along the way. Yes, good timing and some luck played a role in my starting Yahoo!, but there is just no substitute for hard work and relentless preparation.
And along the way, I had a great family and friends to support me. Many of you already know -- especially those of you who have ohana is taking up 15 chairs or more in this stadium -- that we get our strength from our families and friends.

Now, when I told my Mom that I was stepping out of my Ph.D. to start a company and basically sell "Internet advertising" for a living, she wasn't too keen on the idea, but she supported me. These days, she doesn't complain very much!

Point three: Do what you love, even if it takes you down strange alleys.

When David Filo and I were in our graduate student trailer at Stanford, we were supposed to be spending our research time on figuring out algorithms to design faster and more efficient computer chips. But then we discovered this cool new thing called the Web and suddenly our dissertation wasn't so interesting anymore (to be honest, I'm not sure it ever really was, and I can say that now that I'm gonna get an honorary degree!).

We eventually spent more hours cataloguing web links than we did working on our thesis. We slept on the floor of our trailer -- one of us would be programming and dealing with our little Yahoo! site, and the other would sleep... We did it out of love and passion. We never thought it would turn into a business, we just figured that if people kept coming to our site, we were doing a great service and we were having fun!

Eventually, others saw the opportunity -- a venture capitalist was even crazy enough to give us a million dollars to turn it into a business. The lesson here is NOT for you to go pursue a career as a professional Guitar Hero player, but rather to be open to serendipity and possibilities.

If you find something that feels right but doesn't seem to fit into your vision of master plan, take a chance, and commit to it by working hard. You shouldn't be afraid to let passion get behind the wheel -- you might really love where you end up. To quote Robert Lewis Stephenson, "Sit loosely in the saddle of life."
Point four: Get to know the world around you. [By the way, how am I doing? Am I losing any of you? Halfway there!]
That might mean taking your first trip to Honolulu or San Francisco or Shanghai -- or simply logging onto the Internet.

One downside to being here in Paradise, 2,500 miles from anywhere, is that there's a great temptation to forget there are other worlds, ideas and experiences beyond these shores. I'm not suggesting that you need to leave Hawaii to succeed. Quite the contrary -- you can succeed anywhere, especially at a time when technology is making geography irrelevant.

But take me, for example. I went to college 20 miles from where I grew up, and my office today is even closer. Yet I've always made it a priority to explore the world. In grad school, I spent six months living in Japan. There, I made friends who helped me start Yahoo! a couple of years later, I met my wife there, and became a serious fan of sumo wrestling. But it also changed my worldview on people, cultures, ideologies... beer.

So get out there, go see the world, chart your own footprints on different lands than you are familiar with! As the philosopher St. Augustine wrote, "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page." It's really hard to dream if you can't imagine the possibilities.

Point five: Use your advantages to your advantage.
When I was in college, there were no cell phones, we had to deal with VHS video tapes, no digital cameras! The Internet didn't exist -- can you imagine life without email, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, or ComedyCentral.com? I can't even remember how we functioned. I have two young daughters now and I know the Web is bailing me out of plenty of "Dad, why is the sky blue?" kinds of questions! My children will soon discover the opportunities that are literally at their fingertips and they will have no excuse for being uninformed.

You are starting (or commencing!) your next phase of life with a great tool chest. Information technology has flattened the world, and your UH Hilo education has prepared you well. You need to appreciate how great your potential is, given the incredible tools you are blessed with. I urge you to be curious. Don't ever lose your enthusiasm and sense of wonder. Never stop learning.
And my last, and perhaps most important, point: Don't take yourself too seriously.

The name Yahoo! - how did we come up with a name like Yahoo!? What were we thinking? If you looked it up in the dictionary, it means someone who is very "uncivilized and rude." David Filo and I figured we were a couple of yahoos, doing something on the Web when we were supposed to be doing our dissertation!

Even today, we have a purple cow in our lobby, foosball tables in every office, we yodel when we're happy, and my official title is Chief Yahoo. I think that probably speaks for itself. If you can't take yourself lightly along the journey, you are probably trying too hard!

This commencement marks the beginning of a new journey. You're stepping out into the real world. You sit here transformed from the person who came here four years ago. You have a future as critical thinkers, entrepreneurs, lifelong learners, and contributing members of the local and global society.

But you're probably filled with anxiety and questions... What do I do next? What am I trading this parchment paper in for? Where can I find my syllabus for this next class called life? The good news is you don't need the answers today. To borrow the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Life is a succession of lessons, which must be lived to be understood."

And don't worry -- it's a long life, you don't need to rush to be or do something. Your job is to walk out into the unknown and see what happens. Take your time, learn and enjoy something from each job, layer it on, and then pass it along so others can benefit from your wisdom.

And all along your journey, remember the people who got you here and where you came from. I can see the pride and confidence in the faces of your ohana. They believe in you and what you can become. Anyone who spends any time on this island comes to understand the power of the ohana and the support network you have here – it's one that so few Western societies enjoy. Cherish it. Appreciate it. Be grateful for it. Honor it.

Graduates of the class of 2009... Ho'omaika'i. Congratulations.And mahalo.

The plane leaves on Saturday. It’s Monday. So why are you already packing?” This would be the question I’d always ask my mom before our annual trip to Los Angeles. She’d respond by telling me that she started packing early in the week so that if she remembered something later on, she could always pack it. Being somebody who usually packed his bags at the airport, I thought this was the most ridiculous idea.

But Mom, I guess I’m just like you because I started writing this speech back in September so that when I remembered something or something happened or something inspired me, I’d be ready to write it down.

I have to say that my greatest inspiration came from a book most of us have read. Our math book. It was late Thursday night, and I was sitting on the ground with my calculus book sprawled out in front of me, checking the answer to an odd-numbered problem. I flipped to the back, and there I saw the answer: it was a fraction — 2/7ths.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized how 2/7ths, how 2 parts of 7, have come to define who we are, especially as teenagers. Let me explain why. As humans, we usually have to have something to look forward to in order to get us through the days, and more often than not, that something we look forward to is the weekend. We push ourselves through the week to get to the weekend. We push ourselves to the point where we have become 2/7ths people, only really living 2 days out of the 7 in a week.

Sure, blood is moving through our veins and yeah, oxygen is flowing through our lungs in those 5 weekdays as it is on those 2 weekend days, but it is not the same. We are not the same. In those five days, are we really living or are we living on auto-pilot?

Things can be different, though. We can look forward to those 5 weekdays just like we do the weekend, and thereby become 7/7ths people. And thereby become whole. Daily life can be a lot more interesting and meaningful if we take risks, shed our fear of failure, chase our dreams, and spend more time with one another. If we just do that, we will find ourselves becoming more invested in the Here and Now instead of looking at the clock and counting down time.

One way we can move closer to becoming 7/7th people is by taking risks in our daily lives, whether big or small, academic or social. (pause) So take a risk. Say hi to that person in the hallway instead of making brief eye contact then choosing to glance away until you pass each other. We’ve all done it. In the moment, you’re thinking: “Will he say hi?” — “Should I initiate?” — “Will it be awkward if I don’t?” Just say it. Human beings are creatures of emotion, attachment, and attention and you hold the power to make someone’s day. And if worse comes to worst, remember that awkward is nothing but a state of mind.

Take a risk. Next time you are sitting in class and something doesn’t make sense, ask a question. Who cares if people think it’s dumb? Who really cares? Because in a few years or even in a few moments, they will forget and you will have learned the material. Take a risk. Go up to that boy from English class and start up a conversation. Who cares if you don’t hang out on the weekends? I guarantee you that he will be more than happy to talk. And take a risk. Call up that girl for help with homework when you really just want to talk to her because you think she’s beautiful. Better yet, find it within yourself to tell her that she’s one of the most beautiful girls you’ve ever met, that you really like talking to her, and that you think her smile is timeless. (long pause ... smile) Okay, maybe that last one only applies to the guys.

Becoming 7/7ths is not only about taking risks, but also about confronting the natural human fear of failure. The world has spoken and has decided to mark failure as something only associated with the lowest of the low in society, the rejects, the losers.

But when we see successful people in life, we see what’s close to a finished product. We don’t see the process, we don’t see the countless shots the stud basketball player missed or the numerous soufflés the chef messed up before getting it just right.

Really, when you think about it, failure in life is inevitable. It is going to happen unless of course you live your life so carefully that you very well may have never lived at all. And if that is the case, then you have already failed.

Failure will teach you things that you can learn no place else. You may find that you have a great work ethic, a strong will, an extra gear, and a network of friends who love you. Really, how else will you know yourself or the strength of your friendships until both have been tested by adversity? That is why we cannot fear failure. We must risk failure in order to live. And it is in these moments of risk that the greatest memories are made, that life takes on a greater meaning. If you take a moment to think about your own defining memories, I bet more than a few of them would be about how you conquered your fears or did something daring and courageous together with your best friends. We hold the power to make more of those memories.

We also hold the power to turn our dreams into reality, which is another part of achieving 7/7ths. But at 18 years young, it’s hard to know what your dream is. Sure, some of us may know what we want to do in life, but even those people may find a new inspiration along the way.

So for the many of us still trying to figure out what we want to do, just give it time, and you’ll find your dream or maybe it’ll find you. And when you find that dream, you gotta get after it, protect it, and dare to be idealistic. Just like with failure, though, society has turned us against that word — idealism. But make no mistake about it; we desperately need more idealistic thinkers in the world today.

In fact, there are dreamers sitting among us right now. And if in his mind, saving Darfur is a reality, and in her mind, so is bringing peace to the Middle East, then that’s all that matters. At the heart of every great goal is idealism, and at the heart of every leader, every risk taker, every go-getter, is the ability to change our definition of what idealistic is.

Moreover, your dreams and goals take on a whole new meaning if you have someone to share them with, which brings me to my next point: being 7/7ths is about being together. My dad’s always said that the purpose of life is to live a fulfilling one and to spend time with loved ones. And besides being an avid suitcase packer, Mom, I’ll always remember you telling me that life is about cherishing each other and that if possible, every meal should be a social activity. You’re right: we should never eat a meal alone if we can help it. (smile ... long pause)

Because in life, what we are about is being in the moment and making the moments count. And we make the moments count by enjoying one another’s company, by sharing our stories, laughs, goals, aspirations, and memories with one another. In the end, life is about the big and small things. The “A” on the exam and the car-ride conversations, the game-winning touchdown and the “Hi” in the hallway, the college acceptance and the songs we sing with our teammates on the bus ride home — they are all important. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that what we view as the “smaller things” are the more important things. Not to say that the “bigger things” like the classes, quizzes, tests, and essays haven’t served their purpose; they definitely have and we’ve absorbed an immense amount of knowledge during our four years here.

But at this very moment in time, I can’t tell you the distance formula for the vertical component of a moving projectile, but I can tell you about the time we went to Boston for Model UN, and my friend only tipped our cab driver 37 cents. An honest mistake, so he says. And I can’t tell you what my thesis was for “The Over-Soul.” I can’t even tell you if “The Over-Soul” was written by Emerson or if it was Thoreau, but I can tell you about how we came together on that silent Monday after homecoming sophomore year. Ask me, and I’ll go on and tell you about how my track brothers were my outlet, my rock in those times of sadness and tears. These are the things I remember, and you are the people I carry with me.

More than anything, high school has been about how we’ve interacted with one another, with our teachers, coaches, parents, siblings, with people in the grades below us and above us, with the counselors, security guards, the janitors, the secretaries, and anybody else who’s called Deerfield home during our four years here.

It’s amazing that after four years of working, studying, laughing, dancing, and singing together that we’re down to the last few minutes in our high school careers. So I want to leave the Class of ’09 with some final words. I wanted to tell you all that I’ll be loving you for the rest of my life. I love each and every 428 of you. Now I know some of you may be thinking, “I’ve never spoken 2 words to that kid.” I hope that’s not the case, but even if it is, know that we are still connected through our memories of this day and of this incredible school that we’ve called home for the past 4 years.

While tomorrow brings a new journey, today marks the end of a chapter in our lives. No longer will we eat together in the cafeteria. No longer will we put on the red and gray together with our teammates. No longer will we sit together in X202 and Q108. No longer will we walk together through e-hall and g-hall.

The world is now our hallway. Hospitals, office buildings, and war battlefields will now be our classrooms. And my hope is that when we meet later on down the road of life, we will have amazing stories to share with one another. My hope is that we become fearless. My hope is that we live with no regrets. My hope is that we, the members of the Deerfield High School Class of 2009, become 7/7th people.

We did it ’09, we did it.

Class of 2009! First I’d like you to get up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! Show your love!

It is a great honor for me to be here today.

Now wait a second. I know: that’s such a cliché. You’re thinking: every graduation speaker says that – It’s a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true – being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I’d like to tell you why.

A long time ago, in the cold September of 1962, there was a Steven’s co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that’s how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I’m a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: "Thanks Mom and Dad!"

Everyone in my family went to school here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad – all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. He earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad’s dissertation by hand. This velvet hood I’m wearing, this was my Dad’s. And this diploma, just like the one you’re are about to get, that was my Dad’s. And my underwear, that was… oh never mind.

My father’s father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you’re going to go to college. Both his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an "Alley Oop" hammer – a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don’t need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I have it here.

My Dad became a professor at uh… Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor’s life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat?

What I’m trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It’s not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I’m thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I’ve been a part of all of my life.

What I’m also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don’t worry. I’ll be brief.

I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it’s a story about finding a path to make those dreams real.

You know what it’s like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don’t have a pencil and pad by the bed to write it down, it will be completely gone the next morning?

Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and… I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web – he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn’t even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking webpages to make a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it!

When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Their slogan is to have a "healthy disregard for the impossible". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation – you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we "have a healthy disregard for the impossible" and actually build new solutions.

I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. There are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn’t start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting!

As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, "why don’t you work on the web for a while". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times a day? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy!

Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don’t give up on your dreams. The world needs you all!

So here’s my final story:

On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you’ve just been shot out of a cannon at the circus – and even invincible. Don’t ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think.

In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. And that was it. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life’s adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place – people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India – one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home – his first flight. My Dad wrote, "Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far this year. Let’s get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that.

My Dad was valedictorian of Flint Mandeville High School 1956 class of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: "…we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline. … We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can not dream of today. … It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today."

If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn’t gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, that to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today – well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He’d be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he’d be young again.

Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming about future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life.

Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy.
And thank you, all, very much.


Congratulations.

To have found your way here today, each of you has had significant achievements at a world-class college.

I'm honored to commemorate this day with you, alongside your teachers, and peers, and family members.

Finding your way to, through, and beyond graduation is a real feat. And of course, finding implies searching. I assume that's why I'm here. Google is all about searching and finding.

So today, I'd like to offer you a few stories and observations in the hopes of helping you find a few things.

First, let's start by recounting what you had to find in order to get here. You, or your parents, had to find as much as $120,000 in tuition, room, and board. You had find 130 units of courses to take and excel in. You had to find a major or discipline to focus in. 

You also, undoubtedly, had to find countless ideas for papers, insights for problems sets, lab partners, stamina for all-nighters, chocolate covered espresso beans for all-nighters, late night pizza for all-nighters, ways to lose pounds from the pizza eaten at those all-nighters, academic advisors, summer internships, friends, roommates,
mentors, and more. I think we should all stop here and have you give yourselves, your family, and your friends, a big round of applause for all of your efforts and achievement.


All in all, it's an amazing accomplishment to have reached this point, and you should be very proud. Given where you are, it's clear that you're very resourceful, and fact, you're experts at finding your way. Yet, as you venture forth, I'd like to offer a few words of advice.

The first piece of advice is that you have to find something that you are really passionate about. This is perhaps the hardest search most people ever embark on. For me, finding my passion started with science camp. 

Yes, that's right, I said science camp. I am that big of a nerd. I can't even tell you how much fun the non-netonian fluid fights with cornstarch and water were.

But I digress.

The summer after my senior year of high school, I got to attend the National Youth Science Camp. It was an amazing place filled with amazing people. But one person was more amazing than all the others. His name was Zoon Nguyen. Zoon was a brilliant guest lecturer. He was a medical doctor and post doctoral student at Yale. He gave all of us campers brain teasers and puzzles that kept us riveted for hours.

One afternoon, while a group of us were going on and on about Zoon's brilliance, one of the counselors jumped in and said, you know, you have it all wrong. It's not what Zoon knows, it's how Zoon thinks. The counselor went on to point out that what made Zoon so amazing wasn't the facts that he knew, but rather how he approached the world, and how he thought about problems. In fact, the most remarkable thing about Zoon was that you could put him in an entirely new environment or present him with an entirely new problem, and within a matter of minutes, he would be asking the right questions and making the right observations.

From that moment on, perhaps more than anything because Zoon's name almost makes the phrase sound like a Chinese proverb, the phrase "It's not what Zoon knows, but how Zoon thinks" stuck with me. And it definitely stuck with me at the end of my freshman
year of college.

I was sure I wanted to be a doctor, and taken tons of chemistry and biology courses, which, of course, amounted to flash cards. Flash cards of chemical equations, flash cards of file of the animal kingdom.

I'm sure many of you out there are glad to be putting behind you what was hopefully your last set of flash cards.

But for me, I was memorizing facts.

I was good at memorizing facts.

But I had this nagging voice in my head saying it's not what Zoon knows, it's how Zoon thinks.

Around that same time, I had taken an introductory computer science course to fill a requirement, and I found it exhilarating.

Every week was a new problem. Every week was a new way of thinking about a new problem. I loved the logic of it, the reasoning. I was hooked.

Then building on that, I found something called symbolic systems, which was a major that blended philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and computer science together. It was a study of how people reason. How better to learn to think like Zoon than to study how people reason?

Symbolic systems led me to artificial intelligence, then to a Masters in computer science, which led me to Google, which interestingly, led me back to some of my work on cognition from school.

But through it all, I was lucky. I found something I was really excited about early. Finding something you are passionate about gives you a sense of purpose and is a big part of happiness. To find it though, you need to be honest with yourself, observant, and make the most of the situation.

Which brings me to my next piece of advice on finding things. Find the smartest people you can and surround yourself with them. 

Working with smart people means that you'll be challenged to do your best. You'll have to strive to keep up with them, and as a result, they will elevate your thinking. When there are better players around you, you get better. 

I first noticed this when I was growing up. I had a friend, Laura Beckman. Laura tried out for the volleyball team her junior year of high school. And at the end of the tryouts was given a hard choice-- bench on varsity or start on JV. Most people in the face of this choice choose to play and will pick JV. Laura did the opposite, she chose varsity, and she benched the whole season.

But then an amazing thing happened. Senior year when she tried out, she made varsity as a starter. All the JV starters from the previous year benched. 

I remember asking Laura, how did you know to choose varsity? And she said, I just knew.
I just knew if I got to practice with the better players every day I would become a better player, even if I didn't get to play in the games.

How does this sporting example relate to smart people? I deeply believe that the same thing happens intellectually. When you surround yourself with smart people, they challenge you to think harder and in entirely different ways.

My quest to find and be surrounded by smart people is what brought me to Google. When I was looking for a job as I graduated, I chose my job based on where the smartest people were.

At Google, the first employee, besides the founders, is a guy named Craig Silverstein. 

To this day, I count Craig as one of the five smartest people I've ever met in person. I'm also privileged now to count him among my closest friends. When Craig interviewed me, we ended up so deeply embroiled in a calculation of CPU and disk space required to take each search click as feedback into the relevant algorithm, that I completely forgot that Craig had given me an additional task of ending the interview promptly at 4:00 p.m. so he could move his car and avoid getting a ticket.

Of course, with all the discussion of CPUs, disks, and the like, I completely lost track of time. It was 4:15 before I knew it.

Luckily, Craig didn't get a ticket, but was willing to hire me anyway.

I went to Google because in the Laura Beckman analogy, Craig was varsity. And I just knew if I got to tote alongside of him and be critiqued by him, I would become so much better. 

In terms of smart people, I also can't overlook Larry and Sergey, Google founders, who even at the start were impressive and intelligent in their vision. They had made the transition from computer science, PhD students, the type who roller bladed, ate pizza for breakfast, didn't shower, and didn't have the manners to say they were sorry when they careened into you on the hallway on said roller blades, to businessmen. Businessmen who roller bladed, ate pizza for breakfast, didn't shower, and careened into you on their roller blades in the hallway without saying they were sorry.

But businessmen who also had a vision for how they wanted to change the world and how search could do it. I was very lucky to find Google and the smart people there, and I encourage each of you to find the smartest people you can and work with them.

My third piece of advice is also on finding people, and it's to encourage you to find allies rather than adorers. At each of life's transition points, and you are at one now, new friendships, new connections, and new social circles emerge.

In those moments, you can choose.

You can choose to surround yourself with adorers or you can choose to surround yourself with allies. Adorers are people who fawn over you, will point out everything you do well, and make you feel great about yourself. And as a result, they're very easy to be around.

The downside of adorers is they don't ever tell you when they think you're screwing up, when you're misprioritizing, or when you're making a mistake.

Instead, I encourage you to seek out allies. Allies will tell you when you've done something well, but they'll also be honest with you when they feel you are making mistakes or not living up to your potential. This is especially important in the job market. Work for someone who believes in you and invests in you. Someone who wants you to be better and will be honest with you all along the way.

I've been blessed with a number of wonderful allies along the way. My parents, various teachers, and at Google-- Eric Schmidt, our CEO, Larry, Sergey, Craig, my boss Jonathan, just to name a few. These allies have all given me a lot of responsibility, and a lot of feedback on how to improve. Find peers, managers, and leaders who challenge you to be the best you can be and then help you achieve it.

OK, the next thing that is important to find is courage. Courage to do things you aren't ready to do. This is probably the scariest piece of advice I'm giving you today. Do something you're not ready to do. My life has been shaped by four major decisions to do things I wasn't ready for.

As a naive 18-year-old from Wisconsin, I moved 2,000 miles away from home to go to college. As a disheartened biology and chemistry major, I changed my major to symbolic systems when I could barely describe to my parents was symbolic systems was, let alone what I could do with such a degree.

I moved to Zurich, Switzerland for a summer to do research, despite the fact that I don't speak any German. And in 1999 when I was graduating with my Masters, I chose to work at an unheard of eight-person start-up with a ridiculous name. 

Each of these four decisions put me in entirely over my head, each in different ways.
The last one, the start-up, particularly so. In 1999, the search engine market was fractured across about 12 different players. Infoseek, Lycos, AltaVista. Most of these search engines were long gone before you all hit puberty. But the basic gist was that in 1999 the world didn't need another search engine.

Yet when I interviewed at Google, Larry and Sergey were determined they could change the world through search and laid out a vision around how. At the end of the interview, Sergey handed me a business card, a business card printed with a dot matrix printer on the card stock equivalent of typing paper, where if you looked closely at the edges, you could see the perforations where he had torn the cards apart himself, and he told me to get back to him.

I went home and contemplated it. I could already imagine being the brunt of all family
reunion jokes when I was 40. Let's face it, the company name itself is
like a punch line. I could hear my parents already-- when Marissa graduated, she went to a company called -- get this -- Google.

In my mind, I gave the company about a 2% chance of succeeding, which was about 100 times what I would give the other start-ups I was talking to at the time. But I still realized we would most likely fail. The turning point for me was when I realized that I would learn more at Google trying to build a company, regardless of whether we failed or succeeded, than I would at any of the other companies I had offers from.

Doing something you aren't ready to isn't comfortable. For me, and I assume for many of you, it gives you that uneasy, upset feeling in your stomach. That sense that this time you may have gotten too close to the edge. But in pushing through that discomfort you'll learn a lot more about yourself. You'll learn to do something you didn't think you could do, or you'll learn where your limits are. Either is valuable.

It's important to push through that uneasiness though, because in that moment of finding your courage, you really grow and you really reach. I'll say it again, do something you're not ready to do.

My next piece of advice is to find places where you're comfortable. This may seem the antithesis of my previous point, but it's not. You can't achieve your potential or change the world if you're shy or self-conscious or inhibited. Believe it or not, I am very shy. I don't like meeting new people, going to parties, or mingling with strangers.
Growing up, I was always the kid in class who knew the answers and never raised my hand. Interestingly, at Google, my colleagues are floored by this observation because there, I'm not shy at all. What's different?

I'm in my element.

I'm surrounded by people who are just as geeky as I am. They're interested in the latest gadgets, the most intriguing snips of JavaScript, where technology is going, and how those trends might shape our future. Passion is an amazing, neutralizing force. By being comfortable in your environment, you're freed of your insecurities and the things that hold you back, but don't need to.

Find places where you're comfortable.

My last piece of advice isn't about helping you find things, but rather how you can help others find things. It's also an observation on how the world and companies are changing in the information age, and how best to facilitate innovation and creativity.

My advice?

Be an information fountain. Information used to be scarce and expensive, and power came through hoarding it and brokering it. Today it's just the opposite. Power comes from sharing information. Tell everyone everything. The more valuable, the better.
Sharing leads to connections, connections lead to collaboration, collaboration leads to creativity and innovation.

Creativity and innovation are what change the world. Lack of sharing can kill innovation in big companies where divisions turned into information fortresses. They compete with each other and end up guarding information from each other, as zealously as they do from
competitors. Everyone loses as a result. Help others find their way by sharing information and ideas you have.


In conclusion, we live in a world with perhaps entirely too much information, opportunity, and choice. And in that world, finding the right piece of the puzzle becomes increasingly hard and increasingly important. 

I wish I could make finding passion, courage, smart allies, or places of comfort as easy as a Google search. I can't.

But that said, I'm very optimistic that all of you will find your courage, your voice, and your role in changing the world we live in for that better. 

Thank you and good luck.

President Higdon, members of the faculty, trustees, alumni, family members and other guests, and above all, graduates. On this joyful day, we are here to celebrate a wonderful group of young people who have achieved so much, graduating from one of the premier liberal arts colleges in the United States, and who face exciting prospects for the future. The type of liberal education you have received, however, is under assault all over the world in our time of economic anxiety, as all nations compete to keep or increase their share in the global market.

We can see that the humanities and the arts, the core of our idea of “liberal arts education,” are being downsized and downgraded. Seen as useless frills, at a time when nations must cut away all useless things in order to stay competitive in the global market, they are rapidly losing their place in curricula, and in the minds and hearts of parents and children.

The U. S. has resisted these changes better than many nations, thanks to our time honored tradition of liberal education at the college level, which sends curricular and pedagogical signals to schools as well. We too, however, are in grave danger of going down the road toward a narrow profit-focused education. Consider, too, the Spellings Report on the state of higher education in the U. S., released in 2006 by the U. S. Department of Education under the leadership of Bush Administration Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. Called A Test of Leadership Charting the Future of U. S. Higher Education, focused entirely on education for national economic gain. It concerned itself with perceived deficiencies in science, technology, and engineering – not even basic scientific research in these areas, but only highly applied learning, learning that can quickly generate profit-making strategies. The humanities, the arts, and critical thinking, so crucial for decent global citizenship, were basically absent. By omitting them, the report strongly suggested that it would be perfectly all right if these abilities were allowed to wither away, in favor of more useful disciplines.

Why should we care? All of you have had a liberal education, and President Higdon often says to you, “A liberal arts education is the best preparation for life and career.” But why? What difference would it really make if Connecticut College scrapped its liberal arts focus in favor of technological and pre-professional studies? We could go in a number of directions from here, since a liberal arts education does many things. As President Higdon says, it is a preparation for life, and I think you will all appreciate more and more, as life goes on, the expansion of your mind and heart that your education here has made possible. We could also talk about business, since leading business educators have recently been placing great emphasis on the need for liberal arts education as a part of what keeps our business culture healthy and dynamic. 

But I want to talk today about the role of liberal education in producing democratic citizens, the sort of citizen who can keep democracy alive and realize its promise. So: what does a liberal education that contains a substantial component from the humanities and the arts contribute to the health of democracy? Three capacities, above all, I think, are essential to the survival and progress of democracy in today’s complicated world. They are all, I think, built into the structure of education you’ve received. First is the capacity for critical  examination of oneself and one's traditions -- for living what, following Socrates, we may call "the examined life."

This means a life that accepts no belief as authoritative simply because it has been handed down by tradition or become familiar through habit. Training this capacity requires developing the capacity to reason logically, to test what one reads or says for consistency of reasoning, correctness of fact, and accuracy of judgment. Now that sort of testing often produces challenges to tradition, as Socrates knew well when he defended himself against the charge of "corrupting the young." But he defended his activity on the grounds that democracy badly needs citizens who can think for themselves rather than simply deferring to authority, who can reason together rather than just trading claims and counter-claims. He said he was like a gadfly on the back of a noble but sluggish horse, waking democracy up so that it could conduct its business in a more reflective way.

Our American democracy, like ancient Athens, is full of hasty and sloppy reasoning, and to the substitution of invective for real deliberation. With the decline in newspapers and the increasing influence of a talk-radio culture of sound bites, we need Socrates in our political culture more urgently than ever. Critical argument gives people a way of being responsible: when politicians bring simplistic rhetoric their way, they won’t just accept it or reject it on the basis of an ideological commitment, they will investigate and argue, thinking for themselves, and learning to understand themselves. And when argument, and not just partisan feeling, takes the lead, people will also be able to interact with one another in a more reasonable way. Instead of seeing political disputes as occasions to score points for their own side, they will probe, investigate; they will learn where the other person’s argument shares common ground with their own; all this conduces to respect and understanding.

Critical thinking can be found in many parts of the education you have had at Connecticut, but perhaps it is especially found in Area 4, Critical Studies in Literature and the Arts, and in Area 6, Philosophical and Religious Studies.

Responsible democratic citizens who cultivate their humanity need, further, an ability to see themselves as not simply citizens of some local region or group but also, and above all, as human beings bound to all other human beings by ties of recognition and concern. All modern democracies are inescapably plural. As citizens within each nation we are often called upon to make decisions that require some understanding of racial and ethnic and religious groups within that nation, and an understanding of the situation of its women and its sexual minorities. As citizens we are also increasingly called upon to understand how issues such as agriculture, climate change, human rights, business and industry, and, of course, violence and terrorism, are generating discussions that must bring people together from many different nations if problems are to be solved. But these connections often take, today, a very thin form: the global market, which sees human lives as instruments for gain. If our institutions of higher education do not build a richer network of human connections it is likely that our dealings with one another will be mediated by the impoverished norms. And these impoverished norms do not help, to put it mildly, if what we want is a world of peace, where people will be able to live fruitful cooperative lives.

Becoming good citizens in a complex interlocking world involves understanding the ways in which common needs and aims are differently realized in different circumstances. This requires a lot of knowledge that American college students in my day really just did not get – knowledge of non-Western cultures, and also of minorities within their own. History and the other social sciences are key disciplines here, and they need to be taught, as they are in an excellent liberal arts college, with an emphasis on the independent thinking of the student, who learns to evaluate evidence, to think about the relationship between history and her own time, and to think critically about different accounts of concepts such as economic well-being and global development. The study of a foreign language is a very valuable part of this group of abilities, since there is no better way to understand cultural difference than to see how another group of people has cut up the world in subtly different ways, how any translation is always an interpretation and approximation. So I applaud your language requirement: even if the language you studied is that of a relatively familiar culture, it has given you an irreplaceable training for navigating in a world of many cultures. But citizens cannot think well on the basis of factual knowledge alone. 

The third ability of the citizen, closely related to the first two, can be called the narrative imagination. We all are born with a basic capacity to see the world from another person’s point of view. That capacity, which we share with a number of other animal species, is a part of our biological heritage. This capacity, however, needs development, and it particularly needs development in areas where our society has created sharp separations between groups. We know that human beings are all too capable of what psychologist Robert Jay Lifton, in his powerful book The Nazi Doctors, calls “splitting”: that is, we can live lives rich in empathy with our own group, recognizing the humanity of its members, while denying humanity to other groups and people. Good citizenship requires that we challenge and extend our imaginative capacity, learning what the world looks like from the point of view of groups we typically try not to see. Ralph Ellison, in a later essay about his great novel Invisible Man, wrote that a novel such as his could be "a raft of perception, hope, and entertainment" on which American culture could "negotiate the snags and whirlpools" that stand between us and our democratic ideal. That novel, of course, takes the "inner eyes" of the white reader as its theme and its target. The hero is invisible to white society, but he tells us that this invisibility is an imaginative and educational failing on their part, not a biological accident on his. Imagination is cultivated, above all, by courses in the arts and humanities. And I think it is in some ways the most essential of all, if we are to work toward a world in which we see distant lives as spacious and deep, rather than simply as occasions for enrichment.

But today, in elementary and high schools all over America, the arts are being slashed away, since they look like things that don’t help us make money. All too few colleges and universities send the strong signal of respect for them that your own does, and many are even downsizing or eliminating the arts themselves. Literature is still hanging in there, because of its core role in many general education curricula, but wait twenty years and this too may be a thing of the past. The Indian poet, philosopher, and educator Rabindranath Tagore, builder of an experimental school and a liberal arts university, observed already in 1917 that the demands of the global economy threatened the eclipse of abilities that were crucial for a world of justice and peace. He wrote:

History has come to a stage when the moral man, the complete man, is more and more giving way, almost without knowing it, to make room for the …commercial man, the man of limited purpose. This process, aided by the wonderful progress in science, is assuming gigantic proportion and power, causing the upset of man's moral balance, obscuring his human side under the shadow of soul-less organization.I agree with that. In twenty years, the world may remember the sort of education you have received as a distant memory. If that is the way the future unfolds, the world will be a scary place to live in. What will we have, if these trends continue? Nations of technically trained people who don't know how to criticize authority, useful profit-makers
with obtuse imaginations. What Tagore called a suicide of the soul.

But the future does not have to unfold this way. It is in our hands, and, especially, in the hands of all of you, who have had this sort of education – you know its value, and you will come to know it more as the years go on. What you can do is to keep institutions like Connecticut College strong; you can lobby your state and national representatives for more attention to the humanities and the arts, which even President Obama seems to be neglecting. Above all, just talk a lot about what matters to you. Spread the word that what happens on this campus is not useless, but crucially relevant to the future of democracy in the nation and the world.

Democracies have great rational and imaginative powers. But they also are prone to some serious flaws in reasoning, to parochialism, haste, sloppiness, selfishness, lack of imagination. Education based mainly on profitability in the global market magnifies these deficiencies, producing a greedy obtuseness and a technically trained docility that threaten the very life of democracy itself, and that certainly impede the creation of a decent world culture. If we do not insist on the crucial importance of the humanities and the arts, they will drop away, because they don't make money. They only do what is much more precious than that, make a world that is worth living in, people who are able to see other human beings as equals, and nations that are able to overcome fear and suspicion in favor of sympathetic and reasoned debate.

Congratulations. May you live happy and productive lives in our complicated world, taking your education with you and fighting to keep it alive for others. 

When I was invited to give this speech, I was asked if I could give a simple short talk that was “direct, naked, taut, honest, passionate, lean, shivering, startling, and graceful.” Boy, no pressure there. 

But let’s begin with the startling part. Hey, Class of 2009: you are going to have to figure out what it means to be a human being on earth at a time when every living system is declining, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Kind of a mind-boggling situation... but not one peer-reviewed paper published in the last thirty years can refute that statement. Basically, the earth needs a new operating system, you are the programmers, and we need it within a few decades.

This planet came with a set of operating instructions, but we seem to have misplaced them. Important rules like don’t poison the water, soil, or air, and don’t let the earth get overcrowded, and don’t touch the thermostat have been broken. Buckminster Fuller said that spaceship earth was so ingeniously designed that no one has a clue that we are on one, flying through the universe at a million miles per hour, with no need for seatbelts, lots of room in coach, and really good food, but all that is changing.

There is invisible writing on the back of the diploma you will receive, and in case you didn’t bring lemon juice to decode it, I can tell you what it says: YOU ARE BRILLIANT, AND THE EARTH IS HIRING. The earth couldn’t afford to send any recruiters or limos to your school. It sent you rain, sunsets, ripe cherries, night blooming jasmine, and that unbelievably cute person you are dating. Take the hint. And here’s the deal: Forget that this task of planet-saving is not possible in the time required. Don’t be put off by people who know what is not possible. Do what needs to be done, and check to see if it was impossible only after you are done.

When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: If you look at the science about what is happening on earth and aren’t pessimistic, you don’t understand data. But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren’t optimistic, you haven’t got a pulse. What I see everywhere in the world are ordinary people willing to confront despair, power, and incalculable odds in order to restore some semblance of grace, justice, and beauty to this world. The poet Adrienne Rich wrote, “So much has been destroyed I have cast my lot with those who, age after age, perversely, with no extraordinary power, reconstitute the world.” There could be no better description. Humanity is coalescing. It is reconstituting the world, and the action is taking place in schoolrooms, farms, jungles, villages, campuses, companies, refuge camps, deserts, fisheries, and slums.

You join a multitude of caring people. No one knows how many groups and organizations are working on the most salient issues of our day: climate change, poverty, deforestation, peace, water, hunger, conservation, human rights, and more. This is the largest movement the world has ever seen. Rather than control, it seeks connection. Rather than dominance, it strives to disperse concentrations of power. Like Mercy Corps, it works behind the scenes and gets the job done. Large as it is, no one knows the true size of this movement. It provides hope, support, and meaning to billions of people in the world. Its clout resides in idea, not in force. It is made up of teachers, children, peasants, businesspeople, rappers, organic farmers, nuns, artists, government workers, fisherfolk, engineers, students, incorrigible writers, weeping Muslims, concerned mothers, poets, doctors without borders, grieving Christians, street musicians, the President of the United States of America, and as the writer David James Duncan would say, the Creator, the One who loves us all in such a huge way.

There is a rabbinical teaching that says if the world is ending and the Messiah arrives, first plant a tree, and then see if the story is true. Inspiration is not garnered from the litanies of what may befall us; it resides in humanity’s willingness to restore, redress, reform, rebuild, recover, reimagine, and reconsider. “One day you finally knew what you had to do, and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice,” is Mary Oliver’s description of moving away from the profane toward a deep sense of connectedness to the living world.

Millions of people are working on behalf of strangers, even if the evening news is usually about the death of strangers. This kindness of strangers has religious, even mythic origins, and very specific eighteenth-century roots. Abolitionists were the first people to create a national and global movement to defend the rights of those they did not know. Until that time, no group had filed a grievance except on behalf of itself. The founders of this movement were largely unknown Granville Clark, Thomas Clarkson, Josiah Wedgwood and their goal was ridiculous on the face of it: at that time three out of four people in the world were enslaved. Enslaving each other was what human beings had done for ages. And the abolitionist movement was greeted with incredulity. Conservative spokesmen ridiculed the abolitionists as liberals, progressives, do-gooders, meddlers, and activists. They were told they would ruin the economy and drive England into poverty. But for the first time in history a group of people organized themselves to help people they would never know, from whom they would never receive direct or indirect benefit.. And today tens of millions of people do this every day. It is called the world of non-profits, civil society, schools, social entrepreneurship, and non-governmental organizations, of companies who place social and environmental justice at the top of their strategic goals. The scope and scale of this effort is unparalleled in history.

The living world is not “out there” somewhere, but in your heart. What do we know about life? In the words of biologist Janine Benyus, life creates the conditions that are conducive to life. I can think of no better motto for a future economy. We have tens of thousands of abandoned homes without people and tens of thousands of abandoned people without homes. We have failed bankers advising failed regulators on how to save failed assets. Think about this: we are the only species on this planet without full employment. Brilliant. We have an economy that tells us that it is cheaper to destroy earth in real time than to renew, restore, and sustain it. You can print money to bail out a bank but you can’t print life to bail out a planet. At present we are stealing the future, selling it in the present, and calling it gross domestic product. We can just as easily have an economy that is based on healing the future instead of stealing it. We can either create assets for the future or take the assets of the future. One is called restoration and the other exploitation. And whenever we exploit the earth we exploit people and cause untold suffering. Working for the earth is not a way to get rich, it is a way to be rich.

The first living cell came into being nearly 40 million centuries ago, and its direct descendants are in all of our bloodstreams. Literally you are breathing molecules this very second that were inhaled by Moses, Mother Teresa, and Bono. We are vastly interconnected. Our fates are inseparable. We are here because the dream of every cell is to become two cells. In each of you are one quadrillion cells, 90 percent of which are not human cells. Your body is a community, and without those other microorganisms you would perish in hours. Each human cell has 400 billion molecules conducting millions of processes between trillions of atoms. The total cellular activity in one human body is staggering: one septillion actions at any one moment, a one with twenty-four zeros after it. In a millisecond, our body has undergone ten times more processes than there are stars in the universe exactly what Charles Darwin foretold when he said science would discover that each living creature was a “little universe, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute and as numerous as the stars of heaven.”

So I have two questions for you all: First, can you feel your body? Stop for a moment. Feel your body. One septillion activities going on simultaneously, and your body does this so well you are free to ignore it, and wonder instead when this speech will end. Second question: who is in charge of your body? Who is managing those molecules? Hopefully not a political party. Life is creating the conditions that are conducive to life inside you, just as in all of nature. What I want you to imagine is that collectively humanity is evincing a deep innate wisdom in coming together to heal the wounds and insults of the past.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once asked what we would do if the stars only came out once every thousand years. No one would sleep that night, of course. The world would become religious overnight. We would be ecstatic, delirious, made rapturous by the glory of God. Instead the stars come out every night, and we watch television.

This extraordinary time when we are globally aware of each other and the multiple dangers that threaten civilization has never happened, not in a thousand years, not in ten thousand years. Each of us is as complex and beautiful as all the stars in the universe. We have done great things and we have gone way off course in terms of honoring creation. You are graduating to the most amazing and stupefying challenge ever bequested to any generation. The generations before you failed. They didn’t stay up all night. They got distracted and lost sight of the fact that life is a miracle every moment of your existence. Nature beckons you to be on her side. You couldn’t ask for a better boss. The most unrealistic person in the world is the cynic, not the dreamer. Hopefulness only makes sense when it doesn’t make sense to be hopeful. This is your century. Take it and run as if your life depends on it.



“Doctor.” I just want you to know that you’ve made one Jewish mother happy in Chicago — who spent many a sleepless night wondering what would happen to her middle son.

I listened to that introduction. I actually wish my parents were here, because I know my mother would be proud and my father would be amazed.

President, Mr. Chairman, and the Board of Trustees, members of the faculty, proud parents, family, friends, and above all the graduating class of 2009: Congratulations.

I also want to thank George Washington University for bestowing this honorary degree. This is actually the second honorary degree I’ve received this year. Just last week I was awarded an honorary degree for my contribution in the field of linguistics, particularly my work in four-letter words.

This is a wonderful day for all of you, as you mark the end of one great effort and the beginning of another. You’ve taken on difficult assignments, passed tough exams. You’ve pored over course packets late into the night and into the early morning. You’ve worked hard. You’ve also played hard. You’ve stumbled and gotten back up, occasionally as a consequence of playing hard. You also did your fair share of growing up over the past four years.

As for your families, this is their day, too, because they’ve been on this journey with you. They’ve listened to you, worried for you, placed their hopes in you, and wished you’d call more. On behalf of all the parents here, allow me to say to these fine graduates: Text messages do not suffice. Just because you’re holding a phone in your hand, that does not count as a phone call. In all seriousness, as I’m standing here I can’t help but be excited for you. This is an incredibly challenging moment for our country. As the President’s Chief of Staff, I am humbled, a quality that does not come naturally, and amazed by the incredible array of problems that President Obama confronts on a daily basis, a day that will be filled with hard choices about our policies with regard to struggling automakers and unstable financial markets, rising health care costs, growing dependence on foreign oil, dangerous regions in the world, and a difficult job market here at home.

Our President has a tough job, and the reality is — and this is the truth — he needs your help. I can think of no other time in our history in which an educated and engaged citizenry was needed more than it is now.

So yes, you’re leaving this campus and all the opportunities to learn and grow that it offers, at a time when our economy is struggling, our nation is facing tough problems, and a time when jobs are harder to come by than perhaps many of you had hoped for or expected just four years ago.

But I’m also excited for you, because it is at moments like these when we need a new generation to offer new ideas and new energy to meet the challenges we face as a country, because it is moments like these when we prove what we are really worth. I am excited for you because I know that you are ready. Well, you look like you’re ready after a good night’s sleep, that is.

So on this beautiful day, before these eager, wild-eyed graduates, I want to share a few stories and the lessons they have taught me when I faced tough times, when I stumbled, and when there has been an extreme rare occasion that I’ve made a mistake.

I want to start with a lesson that I learned the hard way. When I was in high school I was a pretty reckless guy. Let’s just say I wasn’t the staid and somber figure that stands before you now. I had lost — I was working as a meat-cutter and sliced my finger deeply and not being — being 17, went swimming in Lake Michigan, ended up — it was prom night; that’s a legitimate thing to do — ended up with five blood infections, two bone infections, gangrene, and a 105 fever, and in a hospital for two months, and for the first 96 hours I battled between life and death.

But what started as a minor mishap turned into a life-threatening infection. There were several weeks in the hospital, sleepless nights in the intensive care unit, five roommates who died. It was a terrible time for me and worse for my parents. But to be honest, I’m glad I went through it, because a funny thing happened along the way back from the precipice: Nearly losing my life made me want to live my life.

So the first lesson I’d impart is this: Don’t be reckless with what you’ve been given. Take what you do and how you live your life seriously. It is that seriousness of purpose that I learned in that hospital bed for eight weeks, and I’m grateful for that lesson every day of my life, the things that didn’t matter so much any more, the little things. And I knew I wanted to make something of myself and make a difference in this world.

The second lesson I want to share with you is about learning from your failures. I’ve been fortunate to have found success in my life and I know most of you will be successful as well, because you have the love of your parents and a college education from a great university. But that success will depend on what you do when you fail, because you will fail along the way. We all do.

1992 was a good year, as the President noted. I joined Bill Clinton’s long-shot presidential race as finance director. He was talking about hope, he wasn’t from Washington, and no one thought he could win. It sounded so familiar. We raised a lot of money that helped us spread our message and win a great victory. Soon afterward, I was named political director in the White House. I was on top of the world, and in a pretty good job for someone just several years out of college.

But the truth is, it may have gone to my head a little bit, and I think you can strike the word “may.” I probably shot off my mouth a few too many times and I problem picked up a few too many fights, and before I knew it my dream job was hanging by a threat. I was demoted. It felt terrible, and here I was, thinking that I had messed up the biggest opportunity of my life.

But I didn’t give up. I didn’t quit. I dug in and I dug deep. I refused to leave. But I did try to act with a little less bravado and a lot more humility. I threw myself into the efforts to pass the assault weapon ban, NAFTA, welfare reform, the crime bill, and while doing my best to prove that I could work well with others. And by the way, that’s a work in progress sometimes.But that’s the second lesson in life: Learn humility and wisdom when you stumble, because it will help you when you succeed. Being forced to come back from that failure is why I’m standing here today. You will have failures in your life, but it is what you do during those valleys that will determine the heights of your peaks.

At the other end of this mall is a memorial to Abraham Lincoln, a man who knew something about failure. Abraham Lincoln rose from humble origins, endured a string of disappointments and defeats on his way to becoming the 16th President. As President, he presided over a series of Union Army losses that completely shook his confidence in his generals. But Lincoln drew the right lessons from those setbacks and he kept improving and coming back stronger, until finally he had the team and the strategy to save our Union. The greatest President of our nation, in my view, has known a lifetime of setbacks. His greatness came from how he came back from his failures.

The final lesson I want to leave you with today is the importance of serving a cause bigger than yourself. This is a school in the heart of our nation’s capital, where students and the university itself make public service a big priority. Anyone would acknowledge that America has had a tough couple of years, but in the long run America will be known, not for what we’ve done over these last years, but for what we’re about to do to come back. But that will only be true — that will only be true if all of us do our part.

I can’t sugar-coat the fact that this job market is going to be tough or that the economy is struggling or that we face great challenges in the area of energy, climate change, education, and health care. It’s an all-hands-on-deck moment for America. It’s going to take all of us.

I myself know that all too well. Just a few months ago, I was working in that beautiful building behind me and I loved being a member of Congress. I was working on behalf of the people of the Fifth District of Chicago, fighting for causes I believed in, and I had big plans for myself and the House of Representatives. My family, meanwhile, was happy we were living in Chicago, the Windy City, which I think we brought a little of.

Then the President-elect called with what he felt was a pretty good idea. My kids are too young to understand why I’m uprooting their lives to answer that call, but I tried to explain to them: Sometimes you have to give up something you cherish to be part of achieving something even bigger.There is a greater good beyond the walls of your own ambition, and I think your generation understands this better than mine did and better than most have. In spite of what you’ve seen, or perhaps because of it, you know that apathy is simply not an option, and you’re choosing citizenship over cynicism. Last year 35,000 young people applied for 4,000 slots in Teach for America. The Peace Corps had three applicants for every one position. Americorps has had a 400 percent increase in the applications in just the past four months.

A few weeks ago, President Obama signed into law an historic bipartisan national service bill that will make it possible for young Americans to serve across America and make this a greater country.

It will create opportunities for hundreds of thousands of committed citizens to give back and make a difference by helping veterans, working in schools and hospitals, cleaning up the environment, and doing their part to build a clean energy economy. Whether it is through these new national service corps or by teaching in a school, serving in the military, working in the government, volunteering in any of a number of ways in your community, I hope you will enlist in your country’s service. You’ll be a better citizen for it, you’ll be a happier person for it, and this country will be stronger because of it.

The Class of 2009, I know those lessons may sound pretty straightforward, but trust me, they were gained through a lot of pain and anguish and soul-searching. I hope you can learn from my mistakes as you start this new chapter in your life, because if you have the seriousness of purpose, if you find wisdom in your failures, if you give yourself to a cause greater than yourself, then I know you will do great things, because for all of the challenges of the moment we’re in, there is a silver lining to graduating at this moment in time, because you not only have the great responsibility to serve your country, you have an extraordinary opportunity to change it. You have a rare chance to do big things in this world, and I hope with all my heart that you seize it. You have prepared yourselves well here at George Washington to do just that.

I thank you, I congratulate you, and you wish you good luck and godspeed. God bless America.

President Adams, thank you for that very kind introduction, although I must tell you that when I was president of A&M I always arranged that I spoke before the student speaker. President Adams, members of the faculty, Board of Regents -- I thank you all for being here, and thank you for the invitation to speak today.

I must say, looking around at the flowing gowns reminds me of a former European foreign minister who was a notorious drunk. And he was on a South American tour, and was attending a reception. Music was playing, he was drunk -- saw a person in a flowing gown going by, and asked that person to dance. The person stopped, glared at him, and said, “First, sir, you are drunk. Second, this is not a waltz, this is the Peruvian national anthem. And third, I am not a woman, I am the Cardinal Archbishop of Lima.” An argument for sobriety -- which many of you are probably celebrating today.

As a former university president, I know the selection of the graduation speaker can be fraught with topics and questions that invite many opinions. As I understand it, one of your seniors advised, “I definitely think they should pick someone famous -- not Paris Hilton famous, but someone who has done something important.” I guess it’s all a matter of the definition of “important.”

To friends and family members -- a special thanks for the love and support you have given to these young people over many years. Parents, I know that you are swelling with pride at the achievements of your children. Having put a son and a daughter through college, my wife and I know you are also breathing a sigh of relief -- and maybe already planning on how to spend your newly re-acquired disposable income. A word of advice: Forget about it. Trust me on this -- if you think you’ve written your last check to your child, dream on. The “National Bank of Mom and Dad” is still open.

Presiding over 39 commencements at Texas A&M taught me the importance of brevity at these ceremonies. I am reminded of the time George Bernard Shaw told a speaker he had 15 minutes to speak. The speaker replied, “15 minutes? How can I tell them all I know in 15 minutes?”  Shaw responded, “I advise you to speak very slowly.” I also know that I am an obstacle between you and a great party. Or perhaps, a plane ride, since, as previously suggested, the Georgia Bulldogs are playing the Aggies later on this month in the Independence Bowl. Just be gentle.

To the Class of 2009: Congratulations on a great achievement!

I guess today, as you finish one chapter in your life and move on to the next, I am supposed to give you some advice on how to succeed.  I could quote the billionaire J. Paul Getty, who offered sage wisdom on how to get rich.  He said, “Rise early, work late, strike oil.”  Or, Alfred Hitchcock, who explained, “There’s nothing to winning really.  That is if you happen to be blessed with a keen eye, an agile mind, and no scruples whatsoever.”

But this morning, I’d like to spend a few minutes on a matter I’ve thought and cared about for a long time – the obligation of service and citizenship in our great country. We hear a lot in the United States country about our rights as citizens, and woe be to the politician who dares to tinker with what we have come to regard as our entitlements. What we don’t hear enough about from our political leaders, commentators, or editorial writers are our responsibilities as citizens.

Later today, I will have the distinct honor of commissioning eight of your classmates, eight of your fellow citizens, as second lieutenants in the United States military. They will take an oath to serve -- to serve, protect, and defend our republic and the Constitution that this institution’s founders signed more than two centuries ago. This is no light commitment, and certainly no segue into a life of ease and comfort. They join an American military that has been actively waging our nation’s wars for almost a decade now.  This time next year, some of these men and women could be leading troops in Iraq or Afghanistan. And commitments to allies and partners will keep our forces deployed abroad for the foreseeable future. This is the true patriotism of the deed.

Consider Ashley Henderson-Huff, class of 2004, here.  She became an Army MP officer and deployed to Iraq, where she would make the ultimate sacrifice for her country. I know that she and her family would be grateful for the dedication of the cadet lounge to her memory this Fall -- and for the support this community has shown to the Bulldogs who have fought and fallen wearing America’s uniform since September 11th. These men and women are living what Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he wrote:

The man who loves his country on its own account...not merely for its trappings of interest or power, can never be divorced from it, can never refuse to come forward when he finds that she is engaged in dangers which he has the means of warding off. 

The contribution of your recent military graduates is in keeping with a well-documented tradition of service here at the University of Georgia. Colonel “Chargin’” Charlie Beckwith, class of 1952, chose a commission in the United States Army even though he had been drafted by the Green Bay Packers. Beckwith would go on to multiple combat tours in Vietnam.  But his enduring legacy is the organization he found and led, Delta Force, the world’s premier counter-terrorism unit. 

As graduates of this esteemed university you have many career options in front of you. But these uncertain and difficult times also present singular opportunities to do the most good for our fellow Americans -- to choose a life of service to your community and your country. Nearly 80 years ago, D.W. Brooks was a UGA alumnus with a comfortable perch here as a professor of agronomy. In 1933, he left the teaching position he had held since age 19 and went to work with rural Georgia farmers who, as a result of the Great Depression, had seen their income drop, to average $72 a year. As Brooks said, it was too late for “talk-teaching” -- “do-teaching [would] be a lot faster.” By the end of the Second World War, he had transformed cooperative farming in this state, improved the lives of a generation of southern farmers, and eventually became an agricultural advisor to seven presidents.

The tradition of “do-teaching” is still alive and well here at Georgia. Over the past five years, faculty from the College of Veterinary Medicine have lent their expertise to local veterinarians and farmers in Afghanistan -- this kind of work makes an enormous difference in this rural, agrarian nation struggling to overcome decades of war and deprivation.

Serving others can take many forms. Working in the public sector at some level offers a chance to learn the inner workings of our government and build skills that will stand you in good stead with other challenges. And it doesn’t necessarily require moving to Washington, D.C. -- the only place in the world you can see a prominent person walking down lover’s lane holding his own hand. To serve our country you don’t need to deploy to a war zone or a Third World country or be buried in a windowless cube in a gothic structure by the Potomac River. One mundane factoid: Nearly 85 percent of all federal jobs are outside the D.C. area and there are roughly 44,000 positions overseas – in fields ranging from astronomy to zoology. 

Whatever the job, serving in government requires a singular commitment to missions and themes larger than yourself, and at times can provide some rather pointed feedback. Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman elected to both the House and the Senate, said, “Public service must be more than doing a job efficiently and honestly.  It must be a complete dedication to the people and to the nation with full recognition that every human being is entitled to courtesy and consideration, that constructive criticism is not only to be expected but sought, that smears are not only to be expected but fought, that honor is to be earned, not bought.”

Too often those who choose public service are dismissed as bureaucrats or worse, and in many cases politicians run for office running down the very government they hope to lead. In the eyes of many successful private citizens, the burdens of public service have grown too onerous, and public life has become too mean, too ugly, too risky, too dangerous, and too frustrating. I have seen it all and experienced it all since entering government 43 years ago. I have now served eight presidents. But I still believe that public service remains a necessary and honorable calling and, contrary to the perceptions of many, a fulfilling and satisfying opportunity. 

I would not trade my experiences at CIA, the National Security Council, and now Defense, for anything.  And not all of it was somber and serious.  I remember:

As a 23-year-old second lieutenant briefing a profane, cigar-chomping Air Force general on an Air Force missile base – a character  who acted like he had walked right out of the movie “Doctor Strangelove”;

Over 20 years later I recall being called, along with the deputy secretary of state,  “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee” by Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher.  I always claimed to be Tweedledee. And then there was the time when both the leader of the Soviet Union and the American secretary of state were trying to get me fired.  That episode took some time and distance before entering the “funny” column.  I also survived both of them.

Let me leave you today with what one of the great women of American history, Abigail Adams, wrote her son, John Quincy Adams, during the war of the American Revolution. She wrote:

These are the times in which a genius would wish to live. It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station that great characters are formed...Great necessities call out great virtues.

We live in a time of “great necessities” -- a time when we cannot avoid the burdens of global leadership. The stakes are too high. It is now that America needs its best and brightest, from all walks of life, to come to the fore. If, in the 21st century, America is to continue to be a force for good in the world -- for freedom, justice, and the rule of law, and the inherent value of each person -- then the most able and idealistic of our young people -- of you -- must step forward and accept the burden and the duty of public service.

I just quoted what Abigail Adams told her son, John Quincy. I will close with a quote from a letter that her husband, John Adams, sent to one of their other sons, Thomas Boylston Adams. He wrote: “Public business, my son, must always be done by somebody. It will be done by somebody or another. If wise men decline it, others will not; if honest men refuse it, others will not.”

And so I ask you, the University of Georgia Class of 2009, will the wise and honest among you come help us serve the American people?

Thank you.



Thank you President Powers for that wonderful introduction and for giving me this opportunity and honor to give the commencement speech.

Good evening ladies and gentlemen, distinguished faculty, family, friends, and of course, you my fellow UT graduates of 2009!

They had actually given me an honorary degree about nine years ago and it just didn't sit well with me. I wanted the real thing like you people have and I wanted to be here and get a real degree because, let's just face it, it's not real until it's real. And what you did is real.

Of course I took the 20-year scenic route. I saw a lot of weird things but it's good to be back.

Take lots of pictures. This'll be the last time you see me in a cowboy hat and an evening gown.

I grew up in San Antonio, from a family of 10 kids. Education meant everything to my parents. That's all they ever talked about—not contraception, education.

But seriously, of any accomplishment I've gotten or ever will have gotten, my parents are most proud that I'm graduating. And my parents are here tonight. So are my children, my friends, my family, along with your families and everyone here is proud of you.

Let's all thank our families and supporters for encouraging us to seek out excellence. Give them a big hand!

I know you are all tired and restless and getting rained on and you're ready to get the hell out of here, so I'll keep this brief. I also promise to make this worth your while.

You are about to enter the worst job market in 25 years. And you're probably wondering how you're going to do that.

I'm going to tell you. I'll give you the answer.

I don't know.

I really don't!

And neither does anybody. But that's a good thing. That actually could be the very best thing. Of course, I'll have to explain that.

You've heard that knowing is half the battle. So then what's the other half?

Not knowing!

In my personal experience, I can tell you, without a doubt, that not knowing is just as important, if not more important because you do not know yet what can't be done. You don't know what can't be done.

When you get out there's going to be a lot of people who will tell you, "Oh, you're doing that all wrong or you don't know what you're doing." They're wrong. There's something about not knowing that gives you an advantage when you're young enough and you're smart enough and you've got gut instincts and it hasn't been beaten into you yet.

I'm going to give you an example from my first movie of how that worked for me.

I made that while I was still here a student at UT. I didn't know that it was impossible to go make a movie for such a low budget with no film crew. It just wasn't being done at that time. This was 1991. It was just completely unheard of. It didn't mean it was impossible, it just meant no one had ever bothered to try it before.

And that's how things were done. How did I figure it out? I'm from a big family. I can't waste money. It's against my genetic makeup. So, I had to substitute money with creativity and that's what made all the difference. So, I had to make a movie in a way that broke the traditional mold and learn not to be a slave to tradition. Traditional thinking will hold you back.

And after that movie won Sundance, people then realized it could be done and they were able to follow and do the same.

It seems very common now. People do that. But back then it wasn't.

But I had to be willing to ignore the rulebook.

You can't make a mistake if there's no rules. And if there are pre-imposed rules, break them. Those rules were made yesterday and the tide has already shifted today.

So, be ready and willing to break rules, make your own rules and break those, too.

Be ready and willing to fail. Failure is good. It means that you're seeking new ideas.

Winston Churchill said that "success is the ability to move from one failure to the next failure. With enthusiasm." So, yeah, get happy about falling on your face. Then turn that perceived failure into success.

Now you may have heard several rumors, stories, about how I ultimately financed "El Mariachi," all of which are not completely true. It was much worse than that. Since you're old enough now and graduating, I'll go ahead and fill you in on some of the details of the horrors. Maybe that will shock you into not wanting to take such jobs, that you'll go on to do something else and not become a human lab rat like I did. Pursue your dreams.

They wanted to test a new speed healer drug on me in exchange for $2,000. That's money that in my mind I'd already spent on lights, cameras and film stock.

So how do they test an experimental speed healer drug on you? They wound you. Punch biopsies on the back of my arms—speed healer on one side, placebo on the other. Then after several days they gouge out the rest of that section, sew you back up (bad stitching job by the way), send you off with your cash. You learn a lot from that.

What I learned was that I never wanted to do anything like that ever again.

But it was a creative solution at the time on how to make my movie. But you see there are no mistakes. You learn from everything. Was it a risk to put my arms in the meat grinder?

OK, it was. But it happened to pay off, big time. And that money allowed me to realize a dream.

So you have to take risks. That will be your advantage. You're young, you're risky, innovative, you can think on your feet.

I'm going to give you a tip: How much did you get away with while you were here in the university, simply by saying, "Well, I'm a student. I am free to make mistakes, take the risk, try new things." How many times did you use that as an excuse? Keep using it.

Because if there's one thing I can tell you with all certainty it's that you will never know it all. You'll always be learning. We have to continue to be students of life and students for life.

I didn't avoid getting my degree for 20 years just out of laziness. OK, that was partly it.

But I did it because I knew it was important to keep this mindset that my education would never be done, that I was in this to be a student for life.

Technically I'm a writer/director. People wonder why I also do other jobs such as why am I the editor, the cinematographer, the composer, the producer, the caterer. Well, it's job security, isn't it? In today's world you really do have to know how to do more than one thing.

So a key thought I want to pass on to you is to continue learning. Continue learning new skills.

It's a crazy world out there right now. There really is no surety. There's going to be no comfort zone.

And something that has helped me tremendously is to surround myself with mentors. This is something you've already learned. You've got to take it out there in the world with you. These are friends who are masters at what they do, who challenge me and push me toward excellence, masters in photography, painting, music, filmmaking, Texas barbeque, you name it. I just have them teach me things all the time. And that's what you need to do. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. That's going to define who you become.

You've always heard, "be careful who you choose as your peer group." Now, that meant one thing up until now, but it's going to mean something else as you go into the future.

I didn't know what a peer group was until I inherited one when I became a filmmaker, where I got to become friends with and work with people like Quentin Tarantino, J.J. Abrams, Jim Cameron, George Lucas.

I can tell you it absolutely gets your game up really fast to be surrounded by people who are a lot better than you because they'll eventually turn to you and ask, "And what are you up to down there in Texas? What ground-breaking innovations can we expect from you in the near future?" To which I'd have to come up with something really quick, say like, "Um . . . I'm working on this brand new style of digital filmmaking to bring a comic book called 'Sin City' to life," or "I'm using hi def cameras and strapping them together to kind of do a 3-D movie and re-introduce that to cinema, that hasn't been done in 25 years."

And they'll say, "Ahhh, good show."

So it kind of forces you to be better. And you learned this already when you were here in school. When you wanted to get better grades, who did you hang out with? You found people who were more motivated than you, who were smarter than you and you tried to keep up with them and learn from them and find those study groups. What you do out there in real life is you go out there and you find better study groups.

So, this university has been great preparation for what's to come. Don't forget what you've learned here. It all applies. I'm telling you, it's the exact same thing out there. It's just like college, only louder and more obnoxious. The skills and techniques you learned here will apply the rest of your life. You've already learned how to be a student. That's the main thing. Don't ever stop being a student.

You are inheriting a less than ideal world. And that's OK because, in a perverse kind of way, you are going to have to come up with all these new ideas, take many more risks. It could be the best thing that could happen to you as a person that this challenge is up to you. You can't see them as problems. There are no problems, there's only challenges. If you look at it that way, if you look at a problem as a challenge, you will come up with a solution.

There's a story about going to a class of young children and asking these young kids, "Who can write an opera? A symphony? Be a high ranking leader, a politician, an astronaut, a doctor, a president?"

And what happens? The whole class, they put their hands up because they don't know what can't be done. They haven't learned that yet. It's all possible. Ask the same questions of that same class five years later, 10 years later, 20 years later and what happens? The hands start going down. Why is that? Because they've been poisoned by this thing called "I can't." They think they already know what's not possible and that's the killer.

I've always tried to be that little kid with his hand in the air. It really works to be that naïve, to really think you can do anything.

I've risked signing myself up for jobs I've had no qualifications for whatsoever, but just had passion for them. And you figure out a way to do it and before I knew it, for example, I was writing my own movie scores for a 100-piece orchestra and I can't even read or write music. It's like there's always a way. You just have to keep your hand up. It's really that simple. You can do anything.

There's so much ahead of you and your future, your ideal future, is absolutely something you can create for yourself.

Fellow UT graduates of 2009. Since we are graduating together you can now consider me part of your peer group. Because I'm going to be watching you. The eyes of Rodriguez are upon you because I do want you to do your best. It's what you need and it's what this world needs.

So, since we're classmates, I'm going to give you my Twitter address (@RobertRdz). That way we can keep tabs on each other. I'll be updating it regularly. I hope to hear from you, too. . .

This degree means more to me than any award because an award is something that's given to you and a degree is something you went out and earned. So, you earned it my fellow graduates.

But, do not leave here full. Leave here hungry, hungry for knowledge, hungry to continue learning and to be a student for life.

Today is really the end of one form of education, but the beginning of another.

There's a reason it's called commencement.

Let's not wait to begin though. Let's start now.

Please stand up.

Who can make anything happen? Raise your hand. Keep it up. Now make a fist.

Index finger out! Pinky finger out!

Repeat after me!

Hook 'em, Horns! Hook 'em, Horns! Hook 'em, Horns!

Thank you. Good night.

Thank you, does anyone else feel like you are at a harry potter convention? Either that or a renaissance fair?

Members of the class of 2010, parents, President Cowen or Professor Dumbeldore, I had to get him back for the modeling comment., trustees, honored guests, faculty, friends, Who Dats, thank you very much for inviting me here to speak on this very special day.

I must admit.. I was nervous about what I would say here today, and then I began to think back to my own graduation from college, 21 years ago.  And I realized… I have absolutely no memory of actually graduating college.  I mean, I know I did, because I’m constantly hounded by the alumni association, which starting tomorrow, you will be as well… but if you gave me free catfish poboys at Domelise's for the rest of my life, I couldn’t tell you what happened at my commencement.  And it’s not just that I don’t remember what the speaker said, I don’t even remember who the speaker was.  So I’m not nervous anymore.. cause you’re not going to remember a damn thing I say.  you’re going to wake up tomorrow.. in your own bed, or someone else’s…if you’re lucky. Hey you’re not going to see most of these people ever again, so why not go for it? Your parents have to go to sleep at some point. Anyway, you’re going to wake up tomorrow, and today will be a blur. You’re parents will remember because lets face it, they’ve paid a lot of money to finally see this day, so they want to enjoy every second.

I do hope at some point this weekend, if you haven’t already, you’ll look your parents in the eyes, hold them close, and thank them for their sacrifices.  As hard as you’ve worked to get here, they have worked even harder.   So parents if your kids haven’t said it, let me just say it for them, thank you.

I must admit I always find it odd to hear myself introduced as a TV anchor.. I never set out to be one and am always suspicious when of anyone who tells me that’s what they want to be.. its like a kid who tells me they want to be a politician. I think you should be real person before you become a fake one.

How many liberal arts majors are here?  I feel your pain.  All the engineers here are smiling.  I too was a liberal arts major.. so like you I have no actual skill.  I majored in political science, I graduated in 1989, and I’d focused almost entirely on the Soviet Union and communism.. so when the Berlin wall fell I was, well, I was screwed.   I mean I know it wasn’t about me, and I was happy.. for them.. but personally it was a blow.

I know many of you graduating today are worried about the economy, about your job prospects.  I wish I could tell you not too, but of course you should be concerned.  The one thing I can tell you however, is that this has happened before, and we have recovered.  The currents of history only move in one direction- and that’s forward.   

When I graduated there were hiring freezes at most TV news networks. I tried for months to get an entry-level job at ABC news, answering phones, xeroxing, whatever,  but I couldn’t get hired.  At the time it was crushing.  But in retrospect, not getting that entry-level job, was the best thing that could have happened to me. 

After months of waiting, I decided if no one would give me a chance as a reporter, I should take a chance.  If no one would give me an opportunity, I would have to make my own opportunity.  

I wanted to be a war correspondent, so I decided to just start going to wars.  As you can imagine, my mom was thrilled about the plan.  I had a friend make a fake press pass for me on a mac, and I borrowed a home video camera… and I snuck into Burma and hooked up with some students fighting the Burmese government… then I moved onto Somalia in the early days of the famine and fighting there.

I figured if I went places that were dangerous, I wouldn’t have as much competition, and because I was willing to sleep on the roofs of buildings, and live on just a few dollars a day, I was able to charge very little for my stories.  As ridiculous as it sounds, my plan worked, and after two years on my own shooting stories in war zones, I was hired by ABC news as a correspondent.  I was the youngest correspondent they had hired in many years. Had I gotten the entry-level job I’d wanted, I would have never become a network correspondent so quickly, I probably would never have even become one at all.  The things which seem like heartbreaking setbacks, sometimes turn out to be lucky breaks.  

While I don’t remember commencement, I do remember my senior year of college feeling paralyzed, because I thought I had to figure out my future all at once.  Pick a career, start down a path I’d be on for the rest of my life.  I now know it doesn’t work that way. Everyone I know who is successful, and by successful I mean happy in their professional or personal life, every successful person I know could never have predicted when they graduated from college where they’d actually end up. 

I’m not saying you should take it easy and just see what happens.   You need to outwork everyone around you.  You need to arrive early, stay late, you need to make yourself indispensable - you should also probably get rid of those facebook photos of you passed out on bourbon street.

But as you consider what to do now, you shouldn’t necessarily feel that your next step is the most important one you’ll ever take.  It’s not.  You will go down many paths that go nowhere.  Especially you English majors. You will try things on and realize they don’t fit. And that’s how it should be.  Learning what you don’t want to do, is the next best thing to figuring out what you do want to do. 

In commencement speeches it’s common to give advice.   I know this because for days now I’ve been online reading other people’s speeches, basically looking to steal ideas. Back when I was in college by the way, we didn’t have the internets..with the googles and the yahoos.. we had to steal ideas the old fashioned way, at the library. 

Anyway, im not much for giving advice. Especially after reading some other people’s speeches. I’ve quoted this before, but I think it’s one worth repeating. This is what Goldie Hawn told graduates several years ago. “while you are continuing to walk down that sometimes-bumpy road of life, develop the art of laughter and joy. Keep in your backpack of treasures the whole you, the best you. The "you" that won't fear failure, because lessons learned are the only way to grow.” I know, I just threw up in my mouth a little bit too.

Yoko Ono reportedly screamed for ten seconds at the start of her address.. and then went on to declare.  “I say you can't stand if you've got too much muck in your head. Let it go and dance through life.”  She is so on the money about the muck problem.

Last night I ran into some undergraduates, and some medical students who are getting diplomas today, and after talking with them, and listening to them, I realized that I don’t need to give you advice, I don’t need to try to teach you a lesson… the truth is your class has taught me a lesson. 

You are the class that came after Katrina, and I’m sure you’ve heard this often, but that doesn’t make it any less true. You saw this city on its knees in those weeks and months after the storm, and yet you still applied to Tulane. You could have gone elsewhere.  A lot of folks probably said you were nuts to commit to New Orleans -  some of your parents probably said the same thing.

But you came anyway.  You took a chance.  You made a tough choice, but look at you now, look at what you’ve accomplished, not just for yourselves, but for New Orleans.  Your choice helped this city rebuild.. re-new…re-start.  

It’s extraordinary when you think about what’s happened here.. in this city… in this very  building…nearly five years ago in these seats and these hallways sat thousands of people.. scared.. confused… their homes destroyed.. their lives forever changed. Nearly five years ago, just blocks from here at the convention center thousands more waited for days in the hot sun…lied to, let down. 

Anyone recognize the name Ethel Freeman?  She was at the convention center..brought there by her son Herbert. She was 91 years old.  She survived the storm, but she didn’t survive the convention center.   She died quietly, sitting in her wheelchair, waiting. Waiting for help. Waiting for medical attention. Waiting for buses that finally came days too late. When she died, her son was told to put a blanket over her head and wheel her to the side of the building. And that’s what he did… that’s all he could do.

When you applied here, you knew this, you had seen this, you’d heard these stories…and yet you came.

In your time at Tulane in addition to studying, and working, and (all the other things you’ve done that I don’t need to mention in front of your parents), you’ve also built homes, you’ve worked in schools, manned clinics.. volunteered with church groups and charities…you’ve reached out to strangers, and you’ve helped change people’s lives. 

Nearly five years after Katrina and New Orleans is back…yes, there is still much work to be done, wrongs to right, families that need healing, neighborhoods that need revival, but this city has risen, and its done so because you, and many others like you, did not give up.  Local, state, federal governments, politicians, often failed in the wake of Katrina, but you and the people of this city did not.

In thinking about what I would say today, i wasn’t sure I was going to mention those dark days after Katrina.  I didn’t want to do anything to dampen this extraordinary celebration, but then I realized this day is made all the more glorious, because all of us know what it took not just for you to get here, but for this city to get here.   This day is made all the more beautiful… because we remember.  

My father died when I was ten, but he loved New Orleans.  His family moved here from Mississippi during world war two because there were jobs here. He used to bring me here all the time, and I remember him saying to me that New Orleans is a city of memory. I didn’t understand it at the time, but I do now.

In New York, where I live, they tear down the old, and build gleaming, gaudy monuments to the new.  But New Orleans doesn’t try to erase its past. The Ritz Carlton hotel, used to be a department store, and the old name is still carved in the building’s façade.  My grandmother used to sell ladies hats there.  If you drive down Rampart you’ll pass a school, the Frederick Douglas academy.. but if you look closely you’ll see carved above the front door, the old name of the school: Frances T. Nicholls.  That’s where my dad went to high school.  It was segregated in those days, and Francis T. Nicholls was a confederate soldier, a governor of the state, a staunch defender of the old order. Any other city, would have chiseled his name off the building, but New Orleans does not rewrite history. Even that which is painful is not erased.  A new layer is simply added upon the old.  Walking the streets it’s like reading the rings on a tree. 

New Orleans remembers and so should you members of the class of 2010.  As you leave this school.. this city….as you face new choices... new challenges…new successes and setbacks you don’t need to remember my speech, but remember what you have learned in the streets of this city. The triumph … and the tragedy.. the richness.. and the poverty…and remember how you have made it better.. you chose to do that.. you chose to be here.   I cannot wait to see what you choose to do next.   Thank you, and  congratulations class of 2010. 

It is great to be here in the Big House, and may I say 'Go Blue!' I thought I'd go for the cheap applause line to start things off.

Good afternoon President Coleman, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the class of 2010. Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it. And let me acknowledge your wonderful governor, Jennifer Granholm, your mayor, John Hieftje, and all the Members of Congress who are here with us today.

I am happy to join you all today, and even happier to spend a little time away from Washington. Don't get me wrong - it's a beautiful city. And it sure is nice living above the store; can't beat the commute. It's just that sometimes, all you hear in Washington is the clamor of politics - a noise that can drown out the voices of the people who sent you there. So when I took office, I decided that each night, I would read ten letters out of the thousands sent to us every day by ordinary Americans - a modest effort to remind myself of why I ran in the first place.

Some of these letters tell stories of heartache and struggle. Some express gratitude, and some express anger. Some call me an idiot, which is how you know I'm getting a good sample. And some of the letters make you think, like the one I received last month from a kindergarten class in Virginia.

The teacher of this class instructed the students to ask me any question they wanted. One asked, 'How do you do your job?' Another asked, 'Do you work a lot?' Somebody wanted to know if I wear a black jacket or if I have a beard - clearly getting me mixed up with that other guy from Illinois. And then there was my favorite: 'Do you live next to a volcano?'

But it was the last question in the letter that gave me pause. The student asked, 'Are people being nice?'

Well, if you turn on the news today - particularly one of the cable channels - you can see why even a kindergartener would ask this question. We've got politicians calling each other all sorts of unflattering names. Pundits and talking heads shout at each other. The media tends to play up every hint of conflict, because it makes for a sexier story - which means anyone interested in getting coverage feels compelled to make the most outrageous comments.

Now, some of this can be attributed to the incredibly difficult moment in which we find ourselves as a nation. When you leave here today, you will search for work in an economy that is still emerging from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. You live in a century where the speed with which jobs and industries move across the globe is forcing America to compete like never before. You will raise your children at a time when threats like terrorism and climate change aren't confined within the borders of any one country. And as our world grows smaller and more connected, you will live and work with more people who don't look like you or think like you or come from where you do.

These kinds of changes and challenges cause tension. They make people worry about the future and sometimes they get folks riled up.

In fact, this isn't a new phenomenon. Since the days of our founding, American politics has never been a particularly nice business - and it's always been a little less gentle during times of great change. A newspaper of the opposing party once editorialized that if Thomas Jefferson were elected, 'Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced.' Not subtle. Opponents of Andrew Jackson often referred to his mother as a 'common prostitute,' which seems a bit over the top. Presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson have been accused of promoting socialism, or worse. And we've had arguments between politicians that have been settled with actual duels. There was even a caning once on the floor of the United States Senate - which I'm happy to say didn't happen while I was there.

The point is, politics has never been for the thin-skinned or the faint-of-heart, and if you enter the arena, you should expect to get roughed up.

Moreover, democracy in a nation of more than three hundred million people is inherently difficult. It has always been noisy and messy; contentious and complicated. We have been fighting about the proper size and role of government since the day the Framers gathered in Philadelphia. We have battled over the meaning of individual freedom and equality since the Bill of Rights was drafted. As our economy has shifted emphasis from agriculture to industry to information and technology, we have argued and struggled at each and every juncture over the best way to ensure that all of our citizens have a shot at opportunity.

So before we get too down on the current state of our politics, we need to remember our history. The great debates of the past all stirred great passion. They all made some angry. What is amazing is that despite all the conflict; despite all its flaws and frustrations, our experiment in democracy has worked better than any other form of government on Earth.

On the last day of the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was famously asked, 'Well, Doctor, what have we got - a Republic or a Monarchy?' And Franklin gave an answer that's been quoted for ages: 'A Republic, if you can keep it.'

Well, for more than two hundred years, we have kept it. Through revolution and civil war, our democracy has survived. Through depression and world war, it has prevailed. Through periods of great social and economic unrest, from civil rights to women's rights, it has allowed us slowly, and sometimes painfully, to move towards a more perfect union.

And now the question for your generation is this: how will you keep our democracy going? At a moment when our challenges seem so big and our politics seem so small, how will you keep our democracy alive and well in this century?

I'm not here to offer some grand theory or detailed policy prescription. But let me offer a few brief reflections based on my own experiences and the experiences of our country over the last two centuries.

First, American democracy has thrived because we have recognized the need for a government that, while limited, can still help us adapt to a changing world. On the fourth panel of the Jefferson Memorial is a quote I remember reading to Sasha during our first visit there. It says, 'I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but...with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.'

The democracy designed by Jefferson and the other founders was never intended to solve every problem with a new law or a new program. Having thrown off the tyranny of the British Empire, the first Americans were understandably skeptical of government. Ever since, we have held fast to the belief that government doesn't have all the answers, and we have cherished and fiercely defended our individual freedom. That is a strand of our nation's DNA.

But the other strand is the belief that there are some things we can only do together, as one nation - and that our government must keep pace with the times. When America expanded from a few colonies to an entire continent, and we needed a way to reach the Pacific, our government helped build the railroads. When we transitioned from an economy based on farms to one based in factories, and workers needed new skills and training, our nation set up a system of public high schools. When the markets crashed during the Depression and people lost their life savings, our government put in place a set of rules and safeguards to make sure that such a crisis never happened again. And because our markets and financial system have evolved since then, we're now putting in place new rules and safeguards to protect the American people.

This notion hasn't always been partisan. It was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, who said that the role of government is to do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves. He would go on to begin that first intercontinental railroad and set up the first land-grant colleges. It was another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, who said that 'the object of government is the welfare of the people.' He is remembered for using the power of government to break up monopolies, and establishing our National Park system. Democrat Lyndon Johnson announced the Great Society during a commencement here at Michigan, but it was the Republican president before him, Dwight Eisenhower, who launched the massive government undertaking known as the Interstate Highway System.

Of course, there have always been those who've opposed such efforts. They argue that government intervention is usually inefficient; that it restricts individual freedom and dampens individual initiative. And in certain instances, that's been true. For many years, we had a welfare system that too often discouraged people from taking responsibility for their own upward mobility. At times, we've neglected the role that parents, rather than government, can play in cultivating a child's education. Sometimes regulation fails, and sometimes its benefits do not justify its costs.

But what troubles me is when I hear people say that all of government is inherently bad. One of my favorite signs from the health care debate was one that read 'Keep Government Out Of My Medicare,' which is essentially like saying 'Keep Government Out Of My Government-Run Health Care.' For when our government is spoken of as some menacing, threatening foreign entity, it conveniently ignores the fact in our democracy, government is us. We, the people, hold in our hands the power to choose our leaders, change our laws, and shape our own destiny.

Government is the police officers who are here protecting us and the service men and women who are defending us abroad. Government is the roads you drove in on and the speed limits that kept you safe. Government is what ensures that mines adhere to safety standards and that oil spills are cleaned up by the companies that caused them. Government is this extraordinary public university - a place that is doing life-saving research, catalyzing economic growth, and graduating students who will change the world around them in ways big and small.

The truth is, the debate we've had for decades between more government and less government doesn't really fit the times in which we live. We know that too much government can stifle competition, deprive us of choice, and burden us with debt. But we've also seen clearly the dangers of too little government - like when a lack of accountability on Wall Street nearly led to the collapse of our entire economy.

So what we should be asking is not whether we need a 'big government' or a 'small government,' but how we can create a smarter, better government. In an era of iPods and Tivo, where we have more choices than ever before, government shouldn't try to dictate your lives. But it should give you the tools you need to succeed. Our government shouldn't try to guarantee results, but it should guarantee a shot at opportunity for every American who's willing to work hard.

The point is, we can and should debate the role of government in our lives, but remember, as you are asked to meet the challenges of our time, that the ability for us to adapt our government to the needs of the age has helped make our democracy work since its inception.

The second way to keep our democracy healthy is to maintain a basic level of civility in our public debate. These arguments we're having over government and health care and war and taxes are serious arguments. They should arouse people's passions, and it's important for everyone to join in the debate, with all the rigor that a free people require.

But we cannot expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down. You can disagree with a certain policy without demonizing the person who espouses it. You can question someone's views and their judgment without questioning their motives or their patriotism. Throwing around phrases like 'socialist' and 'Soviet-style takeover;' 'fascist' and 'right-wing nut' may grab headlines, but it also has the effect of comparing our government, or our political opponents, to authoritarian, and even murderous regimes.

Again, we have seen this kind of politics in the past. It's been practiced by both fringes of the ideological spectrum, by the left and the right, since our nation's birth.

The problem with it is not the hurt feelings or the bruised egos of the public officials who are criticized.

The problem is that this kind of vilification and over-the-top rhetoric closes the door to the possibility of compromise. It undermines democratic deliberation. It prevents learning - since after all, why should we listen to a 'fascist' or 'socialist' or 'right wing nut?' It makes it nearly impossible for people who have legitimate but bridgeable differences to sit down at the same table and hash things out. It robs us of a rational and serious debate that we need to have about the very real and very big challenges facing this nation. It coarsens our culture, and at its worst, it can send signals to the most extreme elements of our society that perhaps violence is a justifiable response.

So what can we do about this?

As I've found out after a year in the White House, changing this type of slash and burn politics isn't easy. And part of what civility requires is that we recall the simple lesson most of us learned from our parents: treat others as you would like to be treated, with courtesy and respect.

But civility in this age also requires something more.

Today's twenty-four seven echo chamber amplifies the most inflammatory soundbites louder and faster than ever before. It has also, however, given us unprecedented choice. Whereas most of America used to get their news from the same three networks over dinner or a few influential papers on Sunday morning, we now have the option to get our information from any number of blogs or websites or cable news shows.

This development can be both good and bad for democracy. For if we choose only to expose ourselves to opinions and viewpoints that are in line with our own, studies suggest that we will become more polarized and set in our ways. And that will only reinforce and even deepen the political divides in this country. But if we choose to actively seek out information that challenges our assumptions and our beliefs, perhaps we can begin to understand where the people who disagree with us are coming from.

This of course requires that we all agree on a certain set of facts to debate from, and that is why we need a vibrant and thriving news business that is separate from opinion makers and talking heads. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said, 'Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.'

Still, if you're someone who only reads the editorial page of The New York Times, try glancing at the page of The Wall Street Journal once in awhile. If you're a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, try reading a few columns on the Huffington Post website. It may make your blood boil; your mind may not often be changed. But the practice of listening to opposing views is essential for effective citizenship.

So too is the practice of engaging in different experiences with different kinds of people. For four years at Michigan, you have been exposed to diverse thinkers and scholars; professors and students. Do not narrow that broad intellectual exposure just because you're leaving here. Instead, seek to expand it. If you grew up in a big city, spend some time with some who grew up in a rural town. If you find yourself only hanging around with people of your race or your ethnicity or your religion, broaden your circle to include people who've had different backgrounds and life experiences. You'll learn what it's like to walk in someone else's shoes, and in the process, you'll help make this democracy work.

The last ingredient in a functioning democracy is perhaps the most basic: participation.

I understand that one effect of today's poisonous political climate is to push people away from participation in public life. If all you see when you turn on the television is name-calling; if all you hear about is how special interest lobbying and partisanship prevented Washington from getting something done, you might think to yourself, 'What's the point of getting involved?'

The point is, when we don't pay close attention to the decisions made by our leaders; when we fail to educate ourselves about the major issues of the day; when we choose not to make our voices and opinions heard, that's when democracy breaks down. That's when power is abused. That's when the most extreme voices in our society fill the void that we leave. That's when powerful interests and their lobbyists are most able to buy access and influence in the corridors of Washington - because none of us are there to speak up and stop them.

Participation in public life doesn't mean that you all have to run for public office - though we could certainly use some fresh faces in Washington. But it does mean that you should pay attention and contribute in any way that you can. Stay informed. Write letters, or make phone calls on behalf of an issue you care about. If electoral politics isn't your thing, continue the tradition so many of you started here at Michigan and find a way to serve your community and your country - an act that will help you stay connected to your fellow citizens and improve the lives of those around you.

It was fifty years ago that a young candidate for president came here to Michigan and delivered a speech that inspired one of the most successful service projects in American history. And as John F. Kennedy described the ideals behind what would become the Peace Corps, he issued a challenge to the students who had assembled in Ann Arbor on that October night:

On your willingness to contribute part of your life to this country...will depend the answer whether a free society can compete. I think it can.

This democracy we have is a precious thing. For all the arguments and all the doubts and all the cynicism that's out there today, we should never forget that as Americans, we enjoy more freedoms and opportunities than citizens in any other nation on Earth. We are free to speak our mind and worship as we please; to choose our leaders and criticize them if they let us down. We have the chance to get an education, work hard, and give our children a better life.

None of this came easy. None of it was preordained. The men and women who sat in your chairs ten years ago and fifty years ago and one hundred years ago - they made America possible. And there is no guarantee that the graduates who will sit here in ten or fifty or one hundred years from now will enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities that we do. America's success has never been a given. Our nation's destiny has never been certain.

What is certain - what has always been certain - is our ability to shape that destiny. That is what makes us different. That is what makes us American - our ability at the end of the day to look past all of our differences and all of our disagreements and still forge a common future. That task is now in your hands, as is the answer to the question posed at this university half a century ago about whether a free society can still compete.

If you are as willing, as past generations were willing, to contribute part of your life to the life of this country, then I, like President Kennedy, still believe we can. Congratulations on your graduation. May God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of America.

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.I just went over and said a word to Dean Brenzel, because you may have seen he had an article in the Huffington Post. It said, now if they’d asked me to give this speech, this is what I would have said. It’s really good but if you had done that then I’d have missed all your hats. How could anybody possibly be worried about the future of the world when it’s in your hand? I mean anybody with this kind of judgment and head gear will have no problem solving all the other challenges.

Let me say, in all seriousness, I’m honored to be here. I congratulate the graduates, and I want to thank you and your families, your friends, the faculty and staff for letting me share this day. I am profoundly grateful to Yale because of the things I learned, the professors I had, the friends of a lifetime, the fact that I still work with a lot of people from Yale in public health and endeavors we have together in Ethiopia and in Liberia.

The President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is here and I thank her. But most of all, I’m grateful because if I hadn’t come here I never would have met Hilary. So, she’s been

in Shanghai for two days at this big world expo they’re having over there, and she called me last night and told me she had given this speech and how much it meant to her, how much she loved it. She didn’t prepare me for your sartorial splendor quite as much as she should have, but I’m very proud of the work she’s doing and I’m very grateful to Yale because I would have missed it if I hadn’t come here and we’ve had a remarkable life together.

I say that because we’ve been gone from Yale since 1973 — that’s 37 years, if my math still works. And yet it seems to me as if we were here yesterday. So I thought and thought and thought. I said how can I be brief, which I owe you — you know, when you have as good a sense of humor as you’ve displayed today, you’re at least entitled to a short speech, and still say something that might be helpful. Here’s the best I can do.

The world you are going into that you will shape, should be the most interesting, exciting, fulfilling, and stunning time in human history. I mean after all, we’ve torn down all these barriers of time and space and people are no longer confined to where they were born, and so America has become explosively diverse.

You might be interested to know that at our pavilion in Shanghai, one of the things that is most emphasized is how there’s somebody here from everywhere. I’m trying to get the World Cup of soccer to come to America in 2018 or 2022, and my main pitch is this is the only place you can go where everybody will have a home team cheering squad. It’s an amazing thing and it makes life a lot more interesting.

The internet is amazing. When I became President, believe it or not — I know for a lot of you this is the dark ages, but it was really just yesterday — on January of 1993, January 20th, you know how many sites there were on the entire worldwide web? 50. 5-0. More than that have been added since I started talking.

The average cell phone on the day I took the Oath ofOffice weighed five pounds.Now you know somebody like me with big hands has to have one wide enough so that you only had to redial about one in every four times. It’s a fascinating time.

Look at all these scientific discoveries that have been coming out — the genome was sequenced first in 2000, probably the major scientific advance of the eight years I served, and I spent a lot of your family’s tax money trying to get that done. But certainly the most amusing, off-shoot of genome research appeared the last couple of weeks when we learned that every one of us in our genomic make up are between 1% and 4% descended from neanderthals.And I’m glad all of us made it because if only the men had made it, we’d never hear the end of it. And now we all have an excuse for every dumb thing we’ve ever done going back to age five. It’s great.

I say that but it is interesting. It is interesting furthermore that the genome sequencing’s first profoundly significant finding was that, from a genetic point of view, all human beings are 99.9% the same. Then Craig Ventor’s independent project said, no that’s all wrong, we’re only 99.5% the same. Now with three billion units, 4/10 of 1% is significant, but from a social, political, philosophical point of view, it doesn’t matter. You just look around this vast crowd of your classmates, every single physical difference you can see is the product of somewhere between 1/10 and 5/10 of a percent of your genetic makeup.

And what I want to say is most of us spend 99% of our time thinking about that 1/10, the 5/10 of 1%. You’re going to have a lot of people tell you, and it’ll all be true, how smart you are, how gifted you are, how fortunate you’ve been, how, as our committee said, if we just give one of you a lever, you can move the world. It’s all true.

What I want you to take a few minutes thinking about is the 99.5% of you, because my basic belief is the only way that you can make the most of the world that lies before you, is to believe that it’s interesting and fascinating and profoundly important as all of our diversities are, our common humanity matters more. And that leads us to certain fundamental conclusion, as does the fact that our fate has caught up with the fate of the planet which we occupy.

I think about this a lot now. I think about what young people who have more tomorrows than yesterdays are to make of the world they have inherited. It’s really quite extraordinary.

I read just this week, we had this amazing breakthrough in physics attempting to determine how life on earth began, and the results seem to suggest that subatomic elements of matter, which normally under the laws of physics would be expected to cancel each other out over and over and over again so life could never have formed in the first place, didn’t because there were slightly more positive than negative elements of the most basic building block of matter. If that’s true, it is a metaphor for how you have to live. Thank God and the primordial slime that positive outweighed the negative.

That’s about it, and about what you have to do. And I say that because the world you live in for all of its joys has three problems not very much in evident here today. It is too unstable, it is too unequal, and it is completely unsustainable. So that if you want your children and grandchildren to be sitting on this lawn with their own inevitable choices of funky hats, you got to deal with those three things, and you’vegot to deal with them as an integral part of your life, not something that’s over here that you think about sometimes, because these three challenges, that’s where your 99.5% to 99.9% comes in.

It doesn’t matter how smart you are, it doesn’t matter howwealthy you grow, you’re going to have

to share that with everyone. The world is too unequal. Half the world’s people live on less than $2.00 a day, a billion on less than $1.00 a day, a billion people have no access to clean water, a billion people go to bed hungry every night, two and a half billion people have no access to sanitation, one in four of all the people who die on planet earth this year will die of AIDS, tuberculosis, Malaria and infections related to dirty water. 80% of them will be children under five. Those are the killers of the poor. And there are no health networks out there for many of them.

I work with wonderful people from Yale, who just took a picture with me before I came in, and our Health Access Initiative in Ethiopia and Liberia, and Ethiopia, when we started, the country has 80 million people, 58 million live in villages of fewer than 1,000, 60,000 villages, there were 700 clinics in the whole country. It’s now moving toward 17,000. If we get 17,000 built; everybody will be within a day’s walk of a health care.

These are things that we don’t think about all the time, but the world is unequal. You’re sitting here getting a degree from one of the greatest universities in history, founded in 1701. There are more than 100 million children today that still never darkened a schoolhouse door, and another 100 million who go to school but not really, because they don’t have trained teachers or adequate learning material when even one year of schooling in a poor country adds 10% a year to learning capacity for life.

It’s an unequal world within wealthy countries — most but not all, the world has grown more unequal. The day before the financial meltdown, 2/3 of American families after inflation had lower incomes than they did the day I left office seven and a half years earlier. Median family income dropped $2,000 while the cost of health care doubled, the cost of college after inflation went up75%, and America fell from first to tenth in the world for the first time since World War II in the percentage of our young people 25 to 35 that had four year degrees.

Now I think the Bill just passed by Congress to cut the cost of student loans, the cost of repayment, and let all of you pay it back as a share of your income is a very good start, because that means people can graduate from college with a degree and still join Teach For America, still join the Peace Corps, still join Americorps, still go out into rural areas and serve people, or go halfway around the world.

This is a very good thing, but we have to face the fact that our own country grew more unequal. The world is more unstable. It’s entirely too unstable. We deal with the threat of terror in every country – in America, all the way from the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 to this poor tragic Pakistani man who got two degrees in America, got his citizenship, used it to fly home to Waziristan and learnedhow to make a bomb and tried to set it off in Times Square. Thank God he didn’t learn his lesson very well, and people escaped unharmed.

But it shows you that when you tear down all the walls and youmcan break through all the barriers of information, that the same things that empower you to get access to more information more quickly than ever before, could empower you to build bombs. It’s an unstable world.

The financial crisis started in America, pretty soon it’s all over Europe, then it hurts Latin America and Asia. Now you’ve got Greece, a very small part of the European union imperiling the whole enterprise of the common currency and spooking investors around the world in every place that has significant debt.

We have to reduce the instability.And the third thing we have to recognize is that because ofthe way we produce and consume energy, the world you live in is totally unsustainable. Oh, I know the climate change deniers got a little juice out of some stolen emails at the University of East Anglia, but an independent scientific panel just reviewed them and said they confirm what everybody knows — the world is warming at an unsustainable rate that’s going to lead to radical variations in temperature.

When we had this huge snowfall in February, all on the East coast, all the way down to Florida, they opened the Olympics in Canada and it was so hot up there they were afraid they wouldn’t be able to start some of the outdoor winter sports.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration just released this week its finding that April was the hottest April ever recorded. Clearly, we have to do something, and a lot of people are discouraged because there was no agreement made in Copenhagen. I’ll come back to this, but the reason there was no agreement in Copenhagen is simple — unlike when Al Gore and I tried to take this issue on, now nearly everybody accepts the fact that climate change is real and caused by human activity and we’vegot to do something about it. But many people still don’t believe we can do what we need to do and still grow the economy.

When I was your age, a little younger, Martin Luther King used to say, used to quote the great French writer Victor Hugo, saying there’s nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come. Today with regard to this climate change issue, we ought to say there’s nothing more destructive than an idea whose time has come and gone and people just won’t give it up. The truth is that if we change the way we produced and consumed energy in an intelligent way, it would do more than anything else we could do to reduce inequality, start an economic boom, stabilize our future, as well as deal with the sustainability issue.

It is the greatest opportunity this country has faced since we mobilized for World War II, and this time it can be entirely constructive. And I’m going to make this point a little more explicitly in a moment, but one problem we have in the modern world is we got access to more information than ever before, but we don’t all listen to the same information.

America’s a much more tolerant country today in most conventional ways. It’s not as racist as it used to be, there’s not the religious prejudices as used to be, it’s not as sexist as it used to be, it’s not as homophobic as it used to be– we’re getting there.

The only place where we’re bigoted now is we only want to be around people who agree with us. You think about it. And in our media habits, we go to the television stuff, we go to the radio talk shows, we go to the blog sites that agree with us. And it can have very bizarre consequences. Hawaii, the State where President Obama was born, has done everything they can to debunk this myth that he wasn’t born in America. They’ve done everything but blow up his birth certificate, put it in neon lights and hang it on the dome of the Capital. But 45% of registered Republicans still believe that he is serving unconstitutionally. Why? Because they’ve been told that by the only place they go to get information.

I force myself to listen to people who disagree with me, and to try to get into a fact-based mode. So I will say again, I think that this is an enormous opportunity for you, but you have to understand just about anything you think is wrong with the world can be categorized as a result of too much inequality, too much instability, or too much unsustainability.

So the mission of every citizen, not just in the United States, but every empowered person in the world in this time has to be to build up the positive and reduce those negative forces of our interdependence. Whenever anybody asks me, what’s your position on x, y or z, I have this little filter that automatically runs the question through and I ask myself will it build up the positive and reduce the negative forces of our interdependence? If it will, I’m for it. If it won’t, I’m against it. And I think it’s really important to think about that.

Now let’s talk about what that means. It means that we have to be relentlessly committed to change, and change is hard. We once had a member of Congress when I served as president who used to say, you know what they say about change, let’s do it, you go first. It’s hard.

First you have to have a vision of the future. We’ve got to put America, and increasingly the world, more determinedly in the future business. Secondly, we have to ask the right questions and answer them. Most the time I was in politics, we debated two things. If you looked at the news or read the press, usually people talk about two things.

One reason I combed the blogs is that they go beyond that. But most discussion is what are you going to do and how much money are you going to spend on it. You agree? We’re going to do something in health care, how much will it cost — no, no, you should cut taxes, how much will you spend, right.

There’s almost no discussion about the third question, which I predict to you will be the most important question, public question, of your next 20 years, which is whatever you’re going to do and however much money you have or don’t have, how do you propose to do it, so you can turn your good intentions into real changes in other people’s lives. The how question will determine how well we move into the future.

And the last point I want to make about that is that when you’re determining how to do something, your goal should be what in game theory is called a non-zero sum game. One of the most influential books I’ve read since I left the White House is Robert Right’s Nonzero. A zero-sum game, as all of you know, is the Yale-Harvard football game, right. I mean there’s got to be a winner and a loser. We now in college football make people play 50-11 overtimes until somebody drops, if necessary, until there is a winner and a loser. We’re in the pro basketball championships – fascinating time — they’ll play as many overtimes as they have to until somebody wins, and you know somebody won because somebody lost.

A non-zero sum game is where both parties can win. Zero-sum games are more fun on the playing fields – they don’t work in the 21st century. If the world is interdependent and too unequal, too unstable, too unsustainable, obviously, if you wanted to change, you, have to find a way for everybody to win. And that means politics is important, that means what you do for a living is important, and how you do it is important. Think of this.

Throughout most of human history the vast mass of humanity didn’t have a thousandths of the choices you have before you today. People didn’t have any choice about what they did for a living — they worked to eat and support their families and have shelter and keep people alive, and all over the world today most people still do it that way. You have choices. And as you make those choices, you should do what makes you happy — most people are happiest doing what they’re best at.

But you should relentlessly, relentlessly, every single day check yourself and say, am I building up the positive andreducing the negative forces?Am I helping to create a world in which we can all win?Am I reducing the inequality, instability, unsustainability? Am I building all these wonderful positive things that I have loved so much in my life? And, as I said, that requires you to be good at work, be responsible when you have your own kids, cast intelligent and informed votes.

And it also, in this new century, requires all of us to be part of some non-governmental movement. The NGO movement — which many of you are already actively participating in, in community service here, around the world — is older than the Republic. Benjamin Franklin organized the first volunteer fire department in the United States before the Constitution was ratified. We’ve been doing this a long time.

But the whole movement has been in overdrive for the last 12 years. We have about a million foundations and 355,000 religious institutions doing this work in America — half of the foundations have been established in the last dozen years, and there are parallels all over the world

– private citizens doing public good. The work we do in our foundation with Yale is an example of what we try to do all over the world, in energy and climate change and health care and education.

We try to figure out how to do things faster, better, at less cost, and then get it adopted either by government or in a new business model, so we can go on and do something else. You need to do that, because you got a good deal out of that 1/10 to 5/10 of a percent of your genetic makeup that was different.

No matter how hard you work, no matter what you had to overcome, you’re still very fortunate to be here today. You got a good deal, and you have lots of choices going forward. Some of those choices should be to do public good as private citizens.

The problems with poor and rich countries are fundamentally different, and you’re needed here and around the world. The problem with poor people is they’re just is smart as we are and they work harder just to keep body and soul together, but they don’t have systems and organized structures that give predictable consequences when they exert good efforts.

Just think of just the little thing you’re taking for granted here today. You’d be shocked if this microphone went off and you couldn’t hear a word I’m saying, or if those lights failed. You know when you leave here, if you’re hot and dry you can get a drink of water and you’ll be fine.

I spent a lot of my life in places where none of that is taken for granted. We take things for granted that other people don’t have. So, for Haiti, for example, the work I’m doing now with the UN, and we have to build them systems so that the gifts of their people can be manifest at home and they don’t have to come to the United States or Canada or France or someone else for people to say boy, those people are smart and gifted and wonderful.

Less than 2% of the African American population is Haitian. 11% of our African American physicians are Haitians. The head of one of the largest foundations in America’s a Haitian American. Some of the most important people in the health care community in New York City are Haitians.

The Haitians are rather like the Palestinians — they’re only poor in their own backyard, and they deserve a better deal and a chance to build a better future for their children and I think you can give it to them.

But it’s important to realize that the reason that can happen is there is an enlightened self-interest in the cachetransfers that all these wealthier countries andmultilateral organizations are going to send to Haiti. They’re our neighbors — we realize our interdependence and we want it to be positive. But that means we have to keep getting better, too.

And the problems of wealthy countries are just the reverse. We have systems, otherwise you wouldn’t be here today, but the problem with all systems is that at some point, going back to the Sumerian civilization 8,000 years ago, the people who are a part of those systems acquire a greater interest in holding on to their position then continually advance the purpose for which the system was set up in the first place.

So you tell me how we get off spending 17.2% of our income on health care. No one else spends more than 10 and one-half, and we now have 40 countries with lower infant mortality rates than we have, and we are ranked 35th in overall health outcomes. And the people who fought the attempt to reform health care and finally provide coverage to everybody said we were going to mess up the health care system.

We spend 30% of our health care dollars on paperwork, no one else spends more than 19 from all sources — that’s $215 billion a year, that’s twice what it would take to giveeverybody insurance.

So we have to be in the reform business, and we have to do it with education, we have to do it with government, we have to do with finance, we have to do with the financial regulations, we have to do with energy. And every place we do it we should ask ourselves a simple question. What will give us more positive interdependence and reduce the negative interdependence?

A lot of this fight over the recent financial transactions has, to me, missed the point — not so much whether it’s legal or not but whether it’s legal or not, does it make us more unstable without doing anything to create more businesses, more jobs, more investment, a broader future?

If the answer is yes, we should stop doing it whether it’s illegal or not. You need to put the right filter on your glasses when you look into the future and ask these questions. You need to ask yourself what you can do about it. And let me just like one final thing.

I talked about all these problems, but nobody could stand where I’m standing and look at you and be pessimistic about the future. And I have always believed, the one thing I have never changed my opinion on from when I was your age, I’ve always believed that cynicism and pessimism were cop-outs — they’re an excuse to take a dive. They’re self-fulfilling prophecies.

And, for example, people have been betting against the United States since George Washington took on King George – you should go back and read some of the things. Oh, Washington is nothing more than a mediocre surveyor who lost every battle he was ever involved in before this. He doesn’t even have a good set of false teeth. Abraham Lincoln’s a baboon — be better if somebody killed him before he could take the Oath of Office — an editorial in an Illinois newspaper. I could go on and on and on.

Nobody remembers the naysayers. In the end, all that endures are the builders, and in the end even the builders are forgotten and all that endures are the ripples of what they built, and that’s good — that’s a good thing.

So, go out there with a happy heart. Learn to live with confidence in the face of all these changes, and give other people the courage to live with confidence in the face of change. A lot of these whacko things that are happening in American politics today are not really what they seem, they’re just people screaming — stop the world, I want to get off.The problem is you can’t stop it and you can’t get off.And since we’re all stuck, we better make it better together.

Thank you. Good luck, and God bless you all.

You’re all going to have to be a little quiet because I’m a little mad at all of you. You invite me all the way out here to California and I have the same feeling that I hope many mayors have, that when you get invited to cut a ribbon in front of an amazing edifice, a building, a new school, a bridge, and they ask you to say a few words and cut a ribbon, but the whole time you’re thinking to yourself, “What the heck did I have to do with it? So many people came together and sacrificed and served and gave of their very essence to do something truly remarkable.” You all are that edifice of accomplishment you all have created something extraordinary. You all have so much to be proud of.

Now, this is the challenge for me. I’ve had a few minutes to talk to some of the faculty and to learn more about you, I’ve been reading everything I can and I’m beginning to stand here and think, what do I have to offer you all that you haven’t already evidenced in your extraordinary accomplishments and commitment.

I’ve thought about some of the most valuable advice that I’ve gotten over the last four years, or at least eight years, as Mayor Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, gave me the best advice ever which was, first goal should be to become a billionaire, then become mayor of a city; advice I learned the hard way in my first campaign where I lost tremendously, a spectacular failure and I advise you all, if you are going to fail spectacularly, have a documentary team there to capture it.

But last night, after arguing with the most aggressive atheist in all of the United States of America, Bill Maher, I decided maybe I should offer you all a prayer. And, the simple prayer is this: I would like for you all, that my prayer and hope is that you all be you.

My grandfather said that to me on graduation. He had this weird way, at every graduation, of saying this kind of same things over and over and over again, like, “Boy, the tassel is worth the hassle.” As I went on in college and got another degree and another degree, he said, “Boy, you’ve got more degrees than the month of July, and you’re definitely not hot.” But he would always tell me, “I want you to have the courage to be you.”

As life went on I began to think about that more and more and I began to realize that something that Abraham Lincoln said is so true; he said “Everyone is born an original, but sadly, most die copies.”

You see, this nation is yearning for you, starved for your authenticity, hungry for your originality. But the mistake we so often make is that we surrender our very being, by copying that which is right or left. Alice Walker said that the greatest way, the most common way that people give up their power is by not recognizing that they have it in the first place.

Let me give you an example I learned as a teenager. I played high school football and this guy came in to give us a lesson, a motivational speech and he said, “Everybody raise your hand as high as you can.” We all did it and then said, “OK, raise it three inches higher,” and everybody stood on their tiptoes and he gave us this wonderful speech about you can always do a little bit more.

A couple years later I was a freshman at Stanford University and I was working with a bunch of kids in an after school program in East Palo Alto and it was the last day and I wanted to leave them with a message so I relied on the words of this speaker. I got all of these kids together and said, “I want you to raise your hands as high as you can.” These young people were extraordinary but it was hot, they were tired, and they were like, man, I don’t wanna do that, and one kid said, “What’s up with that, Cory?”

So, some of you, I see, already know what you’re going on to do, teaching and educating, might have better ways of persuading young people. I resorted to a form of persuasion often seen in politics called bribery, I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a $5 bill and I said, “Five bucks to the kid who can raise his hand the highest.”

These kids didn’t need a graduate degree in political science or social economy to understand what this was about. They shot their hands up and now were comparing themselves to each other looking to see whose was the highest. I looked over to the side and saw the shortest of all the kids who was also the youngest, incredibly cute and had a fiery personality, but now he just looked dejected. His arms were crossed, his face was all in a pout, and it looked like he had disappeared inside of himself as he was thinking hard about something.

And then just as I was ready to walk over to him and say, “There, there, don’t worry about it, you’re not as tall as them, don’t worry,” he turned around and sprinted out of the auditorium. I chased after him, caught up to his little legs in about three bounds, and picked him up, and he was wiggling and squirming around, and I’m holding him and he says, “Let me go, let me go!” And I said, “No! No!” and I turned him around and I said, “Where are you going? What’s wrong?” And he looked and me hard and said, “You said you’d give five bucks to whoever could raise their hand the highest, right?” And I said, “Yeah.” He looked over at the kids, then looked back and me, and with a wisdom that betrayed his age, he said, “Well, I know a way to get to the roof.” I gave him the five bucks!

Do not give into this world and let the world set your measure of what is great; let the world set your standards. You have genius, you have greatness, you have glory, you have power inside of you that must be unleashed into the community. Do not settle. Do not yield. You have a truth that must be told. These to me are the compromises that are too often made when people simply resign themselves to a world as it is. People just look at what’s happening outside and realize they’re just spectators in a crazy complex world they have no power in. The greatest teachers of my life were truths told to me on my graduation by people like my granddad you said, “Boy, never forget that you can learn more from a woman on the fifth floor of the projects than you ever can from one of these fancy professors.”

And indeed, when I answered the calling of a great American philosopher named Chris Rock, who once said in one of his comic routines, why is the most violent street in every city named for the man who stood for nonviolence? When I was a young law student I decided to move onto Martin King Luther Jr. Boulevard in Newark, New Jersey, I found a street that had actually great glory, great accomplishment, but I moved onto a section that was indeed violent. I lived there for months, and in the first days, I wanted to make a difference, but I was overcome by a virulent narcotics trade punctuated by violence, I saw decaying buildings, I saw a house used for drug addicts, I saw these challenges as I stood before these high rise housing complexes.

And somebody said to me, “Cory, if you’re going to organize here, if you’re going to get involved you need to meet the tenant president because she is the anchor of the community,” and I was went to go to her door I heard my grandfather’s words because lo and behold, she lived on the fifth floor. I knocked on her door, pulled up my pants like John Wayne ready to have a conversation. She opened the door and said, “Who are you?” and I said, “Ma’am, I’m Cory Booker from Yale Law School, and I’m here to help you.” And she looked at me and she said, “You want to help me?” and I said, “Yes, I do.” And she said, “Well, ok.” She closed the door and she said, “Follow me.” She walks down five flights of stairs, I follow after her, she walks through the courtyard through some drug dealers, I walked very close to her at that point, and got right into the middle of the street, traffic going both ways. And she wheels around and she says, “Tell me, if you really want to help me, tell me what you see around you.” And I look around and go, “What do you mean?” And she said, “Describe what you see.” And I said, “Ok, I see decaying buildings, I see an abandoned home, I see guys involved in the narcotic trade,” which I said in a very respectful tone, and I described the neighborhood.

And this powerful, dignified, African American elder looked at me with such disappointment bordering on disgust. She just shook her head and said, “You can’t help me.” She turns around and starts walking to the side of the road. I stand there bewildered and confused, weave through traffic, get to the side of the road, and said, “Ma’am, what are you talking about?” She wheels around, she’s was about five feet and a smidgeon, and she looks up at me at 6’3” and at that point I felt like I was looking up to her and she said to me, “Boy, you need to understand something. The world you see outside of you is a reflection of what you have inside of you. And if you’re one of those people who only sees problems and darkness and despair that’s all it’s ever going to be. But if you’re one of those people who no matter what, when you open your eyes you see hope, you see opportunity, you see love, you see the face of God, then you can be someone who helps me.”

She walks away, I look down and think to myself, “OK, Grasshopper, that’s the end of the lesson.” I went back to her apartment the next day. I sat there for days watching this woman join with other women in those buildings, create light and transformation and be there for others. They would hold events for kids whatever the holiday was, in a dank basement; that’s what I saw but they transformed it every opportunity they had into a celebration. You name it; Flag Day, St. Patrick’s Day even though there wasn’t an Irish person within blocks of there. They changed the world. And out of those buildings came community activists, nonprofits, out of those buildings that building turned by, and drove by with disgust and disdain and disregard or fear, they created an oasis. This is the power that you have if you choose not to surrender it. You can transform reality with your very thoughts. You have a choice in every moment of your life. This is the story of humanity, it is the great moment. Every second you can choose accept conditions as they are or take responsibility for changing them.

Viktor Frankl, who wrote in “Man’s Search for Meaning,” to paraphrase him, in that book he writes, “We who were in the concentration camps remember people who comforted others, who gave away their only piece of bread, theirs was a great testimony. The greatest of all human freedoms is to choose your attitude in any given set of circumstances.”

Let me give you a less serious but smaller example and I’m telling you there’s nothing small about this word. I had to travel from Newark Airport to San Francisco Airport for the five years I was going to college out here. And I would get on that plane and I’m telling you right now that when you’re 6’3” and back then I’m as large as I am now but I was chiseled then (imagine that if you will), getting space next to you was a truly glorious find. And here I was one day on an airplane with a packed plane, loud, screaming, carry on bags, people wrestling with each other but I had this whole spaces next to me, two empty spaces, and the airplane door just closed and I got more religious than a Baptist minister looking up and good and saying, “Thank you dear Lord, I am your favorite son today!” And then just when I was getting going, in my prayer and praise the door of the plane opened. And almost as if somebody hooked up a nuclear powered generator the whole plane emanated with the screams of a child, and a woman walks on that plane with a toddler and a woofer and tweeter in her arms brilliantly disguised as a baby. And suddenly the loud plane got silent and every passenger turned and looked at me. And now my conversations with God were dramatically different. “Dear Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?”

This woman comes over and she says, “I’m sitting there” and she sits, down, three bodies, two seats, next to me. Chiseled or not, I was not happy. And I realized at that point that this was a test. Every moment of your life will you manifest your originality, your truth, your love. I said, you know what, this could either be the worst plane trip of my life or I could try to make it the best. And I turned to her and tried to make her smile because she actually did look really uncomfortable and embarrassed. I started talking with her and soon I was playing games with the kid, the plane was taking off, we were playing tic tac toe, and I unleashed every joke that I had on that poor kid. “Why do Tigger and Eyore put their head in the toilet? Because they’re looking for Pooh!” I tried. I gave it all I had.

We were having a blast on this flight, laughing. I remember the movie that came on, it was “Glory,” and she, like many young mothers said, “I haven’t been to the movies in weeks.” And I said, “You’ve got to see this movie, I’ll hold your baby.” We had this amazing trip. We landed in San Francisco and it was the shortest flight I’d ever taken coast to coast. Time flew. We exchanged addresses, you know how you intend to keep in touch but we didn’t. I was in college; I was so busy! I graduated from college.

Five years passed, ten years passed, fifteen years passed. I’m in the middle of a street fight; I’m running for mayor; thank God that documentary team was there to capture it. That documentary was nominated for an Academy Award, and lost to “March of the Penguins.” I hate the flightless rodents but that’s a whole different speech (Morgan Freeman can kiss my derriere). And on the worst day, the lowest moment when we were getting definitely beaten and I was feeling why are we in this, I get a letter in the mail that says, “You may not remember me by fifteen years ago I met you on an airplane from Newark to San Francisco. The kindness you expressed to me still is with me today.” She went on talking about how that flight affected her, the first time flying with her children, how that kindness impacted her. She told me that she owned a factory with her family in the city of Newark. She offered something that every politician in America loves; a campaign contribution. That young toddler that I tortured with some of the best jokes ever told ended up being an amazing volunteer on my campaign.

What you put out in this universe does not die. You may be taken from this earth, people may forget your name, but your love will live forever. I now know more than ever that this is the power we cannot give up; these are the abilities that make real changes. I see it in the heroes I get to serve with every single day in Newark. People that manifest who they are, not through what they say but by what they do.

There’s a man in a high rise in Newark, New Jersey; I was with him last week. I didn’t get to know him until he did something that was just odd. He got a stimulus check in the mail and thought about it. Outside of his window in the high rises there was this lot overgrown with weeds and debris that was being used for a virulent drug trade. He looked at his stimulus check and instead of buying a flat screen tv or going out to dinner with friends, he went out and bought a lawnmower, goes right into that lot and didn’t talk to the drug dealers but starts mowing the lawn. The first day he messed up and actually bagged their stash so the guys were trying to get it, but he got up day after day and manicured that lot. He took his spirit and mixed it with the soil of that space. It looked beautiful, weed wacking it, and soon the drug dealers left. He became a hero in his neighborhood. We found out about him because he was mowing the lawn along a median of a street. We stopped him and said “What are you doing?” And he said, “Look, this street is mine as much as it is anybody else’s. I am responsible.

I’m telling you right now, life will deliver you joy and happiness and moments of exaltation like this but I also promise you, you will face darkness and pain and even, God forbid, tragedy. There will be days that taking a breath will feel like a momentous effort, and getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. I’m telling you, those more than the joy or the pleasure, those will be the moments that are the most valuable in your journey. Those are the moments that you will discover the truth of who you are. In the depths of darkness you will find that you have an inextinguishable light in your heart. In the most cold winter you will discover that within you there in an invincible spring. This is who you are. And when you meet those moments, what you do there will not be just defining you but it will give liberation and light to all those who bear witness to your being.

A friend of mine was coming out of a diner. He and his friend meant an assailant. He watched as his friend was shot and murdered before his eyes. The gunman turned the gun on him and he was shot three times; in the side of his face, in his shoulder and in the side of the stomach. And he put his head down and charged the assailant, tackling him and holding him on the pavement until the police arrived, and he bled that sidewalk red. I visited him in the hospital like I’ve done at least a dozen times as mayor. I’ve seen bodies broken; a fireman, a policeman, auto accidents. He looks up at me, body broken but his spirit was on fire. He made me walk out of the hospital without me giving him comfort; he told me, Mayor, it’s going to be ok.

But we’re not defined in individual moments. As great as that moment showed the truth of who he was, I walked out of that hospital; months later I get a call that this man recovered from his injuries; had decided to join the Newark Police Academy because he was going to make sure that no one else faced what he faced. Day after day he would get up and do what is necessary. Because life is not about the big moments, the great speech, life is about every single day, getting up to manifest your truth and in actions that are not required of you or demanded of you, showing small consistent acts of kindness and decency and love that in the aggregate add up to tremendous change.

This is, to me, what power is about, when you’re unyielding in your love.

I told you about graduations and let me end with this vignette. Some of you consider yourselves lucky because my family on graduation days was unbelievable. When they had only a certain amount of tickets to give out to families, I got caught up in the great counterfeit graduation ticket scandal because my parents and family and cousins were going to be there no matter what. We may be in the only family in America that has been sanctioned by the FAA because there was one night graduation and my gaggle of family created one sustained flash burst with all their multiple cameras that blinded incoming planes to Newark Airport. And my grandfather, who met me on those graduations, who imparted his jokes, who imparted his wisdom, who challenged me to live my truth to be me, he was my greatest hero.

You see, my grandfather we born to a single mother, African American woman deep in Louisiana. He was born of a white father that he never met except for once, and he wasn’t even told about it until after the fact. He faced real challenges of vicious, vicious Jim Crow and divisions that went to the core of our county’s ideals; he faced terrible health problems at an early age. He worked in Ford motor plants on assembly lines where the union organizer was a teacher, here on California on airplanes, he worked three and four jobs, raising his family. He was an entrepreneur and started businesses where he would collect quarters and buy yet another machine to wash clothes and collect quarters and buy yet another. Eventually he was investing in real estate and made some money. Eventually he moved out to Las Vegas and in his interesting humor, when he did he said, “Son, always bet on black,” and I said, “Ok, granddad, ok.” And he was living large out there in Vegas. He faced cancer a number of times and at one of his battles when he was beating that beast back it looks like he is struggling. I remember helping him in bed and he looks up at me just before I said goodbye before flying back to New Jersey and he said, “Son, I love you. I love you and I love your children and I love your grandchildren. And I thought he was delirious and confused because I don’t have any children and therefore they don’t have any children and I thought he may have been thinking he was looking at one of his children, but I left with love in my heart. I got home and got caught up in that 2002 political campaign and I’ll never forget the day when I got the call as I was rushing to a campaign stop, that a relative called to tell me to call my grandmother because my grandfather was dead. And I remember pulling off to the side of the road and just weeping and weeping, feeling such a depth of sorrow, much of which, honestly, I still feel today.

But as I looked for something to grasp upon, I found those words of my grandfather. He said he loved me. And he loved my children and my children’s children. You see, this is how so many of our family member live. They live with a courageous love. They don’t just love you, they love children yet unborn. They love people whose names they don’t even know yet. It’s this love that has sustained this young nation, people who fought against slavery and subjugation, who love so much that they gave life to us who stand here. People that love so hard that they their farms and their cities to join Washington’s army and so many other military campaigns, who stood on beaches at Normandy showing their courage and their love, people who love in ways that rarely get in the papers, who love themselves and their families through drug addiction, who love themselves and their families through two and three jobs, they love so much that they’re going to continue to infuse jobs, no matter how humble, with their very essence so that their community can continue.

This is the love that calls to our consciousness. This is the love that has provided us our existence. We as a people drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig, we eat lavishly from banquet tables prepared by the loving hands of our ancestors who could scarcely imagine our existence but we owe it to them. This is that love. People who live their truth, people who show their authenticity.

So now, I end with these words. Be you. But never forget you’re part of a collective. Never forget you are part of a community. Never forget you are part of a nation. Never forget that you’re part of a human family. Don’t be one of those people who stands on top of a mast, like a flag, beating in the wind, making noise, showing your colors, but not helping us move anywhere. Be that piece of fabric a little below that flag. Clinging to the mast, you are a sail, that very fabric of your being, you’re manifesting not by dancing in the wind, whichever way it blows, but you’re facing it. Because of your courage you’re helping the whole ship move forward. There are ideals that got us here that were lived.

I end with a poem that my parents read to me as a boy, challenging me to live this way, daring me to stand up, by Langston Hughes who simply said, “Oh, let America be America again, the land that never has been yet, but yet must be, the land where everyone is free, the poor man, the Indian, the Negro, me. Who made America? Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand on the foundry, whose plow in the rain, must make our mighty dream live again. Oh yes, I see it plain. America never was America to me, but I swear this oath America will be.”

Class of 2010, you must swear, swear not to die a copy, swear not to live a lie, swear that you will declare your truth every day in ways big and most importantly, in ways small, swear that you will make conscious choices and infuse your being in those ordinary moments so they might resound with your love. And if we do this, class of 2010, we will transform our world, we will advance the human family. We’ll make real on the promise of our country and we in the collective will have shown that we found a way to the roof.

Thank you.

Alumni, President Stewart, Members of the DeVry Faculty, honored guests, and proud parents:

It is an honor and most humbling to be here today. My degrees came by post. I think my alma mater was celebrating my absence more than awarding me with diplomas.

Many of my years at university were confusing to me. I tended to rebel when instructors insisted on irrelevant things like grammar, punctuation, geometry, and music appreciation. Many students seemed to have similar frustrations. My nucleus of friends tended to be renegades and outcasts from the cloistered academic norm of those days.

Nothing would deviate us from our goals...except the fact that we didn't have a clue how to achieve them.

My freshman angst had no bounds. It was based upon the youthful paradox of thinking I knew it all but deep down knowing that I didn’t.

My education nearly ended before it started. One Physics professor seemed determined to inhibit my progress. "You can't take Physics until you pass trigonometry". He insisted.

What did he know, I thought? I wanted to be a globe trotting environmentalist, bust polluters, teach and maybe write books.

I made the mild suggestion that he suffered from a mental deficiency he may have inherited from his maternal canine parent.

I'd like to state emphatically, such gems of wit are not to be encouraged.

You see, the next quarter I applied for an advanced zoology class and learned that same professor was the Dean of the Science Department.

College lesson #1: “Put mind in gear before putting my mouth in motion.”

College lesson #2: Never give up your dream.

My good buddy in High School was Nick Gier. Nick was brilliant — he wasn't interested in how things should be done, but why things should be done. He didn't want to know why the chicken crossed the road. He wanted to know what compelled people to ask the question in the first place.

Ralph, another college chum, was only interested in birds. He nearly failed his morning classes because he would be in the field expanding his "life list" of new bird species. Ralph could not only tell the species, but often the gender of a bird, just by its song.

Today our world is more complicated than ever. The earth is not in better shape. Doom seems to be around every corner, and leaking oil wells under every rock. Some of you may think that these troubled times are beyond help. Some may think it’s everyone for themselves. Our goals and dreams are just fantasies, drifting on the wind. Well you would be wrong.

My father is a reservoir of memorable sayings. One is: “Don’t expect your ship to come in unless you sent one out.”

Remember lesson #2: Never give up your dreams.

So what did happened to Nick and Ralph? Well, my buddy Nick has lectured around the world, became a noted author, and just retired after more than 30 years as Professor of Philosophy at the University of Idaho.

And our "bird man", what became of him? Marvin Ralph Browning recently retired as the Curator of Birds at the Smithsonian in Washington DC.

None of this would have been possible without the embrace of academia. Looking back I realize that without stifling our dreams our instructors molded, and honed our skills; not to their purposes, but to ours. In each instance college professors overlooked our hubris. Teachers saw beyond the bravado, and gave us tools we never dreamed we would need. Like grammar, punctuation…and, trigonometry. They gave us the sturdy foundation that allowed us to construct our own futures and achieve our goals.

College gave us exactly what we paid for...an education. The rest was up to us.

Education is not the whole solution. It isn’t enough to just want something but to move ahead relentlessly regardless of the obstacles. Let me give you another example.

Gramma never stood over 5' in her life, but she was a giant with true grit in her veins. Mable Mae was born in 1895. When 11 years old she bawled out Teddy Roosevelt for “speechifying” while her family was trying to sell vegetables at the farmer’s market. She had a friend whose grandmother was over 100 years old. That old pioneer woman told her of watching Lewis and Clark return from their trek across the continent. Mable Mae and Gramps moved to Alberta with three daughters and my dad still in diapers. Before they finished the cabin Gramps was called away on a government geology contract. Gramma and the kids were left alone, to finish their one room cabin, and survive that first Canadian winter. She talked about cutting 14 cords of wood, and splitting the shingles for the roof. Of course, then, she had to shingle the roof.

I recall one day she casually mentioned shooting a grizzly that burst into her kitchen. "We kept our thuddy thuddy close at hand in those days.” She said offhandedly.

When she died, just shy of 106, I felt even that, was on her terms.

Why do I relate this little story? Because, in two very long lifetimes, most of the history of this country drifted by. In Gramma's lifetime America went from sail to steam to the moon — from candle light, to electric lights — from radio to IPods and the blockbuster movie Avatar in...3D.

I hear people who say. “What’s the use?” Some don’t vote because, “What’s the use?” The problems are too great. The obstacles are too difficult. The mountain is too high.

Thomas Edison once said. “I have not failed 1,000 times. I have successfully discovered 1,000 ways to NOT make a light bulb.”

Well standing before you is a dyslexic, dreamer who occasionally shoots off his big mouth and makes loads of mistakes. What of my dreams?

I started and ran a successful travel adventure company in the Himalayas, and began the concept of eco-tours. For more than 30 years I worked for the U.S. EPA as their Senior Compliance Investigator... busting polluters. Later I worked with the UN and World Bank helping other nations to develop their own environmental policies, and regulations. I even wrote an environmental compliance training manual used by EPA and other nations around the world.

When you fail at something, think about what you have accomplished here and the reason for this ceremony. Here is proof that YOU CAN!

Never give up your dreams.

Whatever blocks you encounter, you have learned that there is a way over, around or through them. It is not those obstacles that inhibit your progress but your confidence, and will to break the inertia of fear and doubt.

My father told me. "Whether or not you think you can, you are right." Think about that. It is not thinking that you can’t, but that you CAN that counts.

"Whether of not you think you can you are right."

We live in a time of enormous challenges. There are so many issues that face our globe, our nation, our family, and us as individuals. But imagine a world where there were few options. Imagine a world where the nearest town was a week away on foot. Few of us have to worry about Grizzlies breaking into the kitchen. Where there are so many challenges there are many, many more options to deal with them.

What you have learned here at DeVry is that YOU CAN. Remember that.

You live in a world not filled with unsolvable obstacles but in a world where the possibilities are greater than ever in history.

Whether or not you think you can, you are right.

We know you can, and you have earned a certificate to prove our confidence in you.

A young president Kennedy once said. “If not us who? If not now when?”

Now is your when. Congratulations.

Thank you.

What an honor it is to be here. Thank you to Father Wilds, distinguished faculty, esteemed trustees, guests and of course the 2010 graduating class here at Loyola University. I’ll be honest, I was a little nervous about using distinguished and esteemed in the same sentence because I thought it would come out extinguished and that is not the description I wanted to use.

Certainly you are all distinguished and esteemed and it is an honor to be here. We have a lot in common. Most of us came to New Orleans around the same time, the spring or summer of 2006 when that was not the most popular thing to do. For me, I felt like coming to New Orleans was a calling and for you, there must have been something drawing you here as well. A much stronger force that we can’t necessarily describe other than we know that we belonged here.

Now, four years later, we can reflect back and say that we were a part of something special and certainly the work is not done yet but we were part of something special. We’ve all watched the city not just come back but comeback stronger than ever. We’ve seen the people come back with more passion and determination than before and we’ve all been part of the super bowl championship. No matter where you’re from or where you go from here keep New Orleans close to your heart and remember what you were a part of and know that now we are all linked together forever.

As I look out at the young men and women graduates of Loyola University class of 2010, I’m so excited for you all. What you’re about to experience will be eye opening, certainly rewarding, and challenging at times. They say experience is what you gain when you don’t get what you want. I can promise you that over the next few years you will gain experience. You will not always get what you want. You will face adversity, but know that the sky is the limit as to what you can all accomplish.

There are some of you that will be doctors, lawyers, politicians, writers, artists, teachers, coaches, entrepreneurs, inventors and maybe one of you will even own anNFL franchise someday. I can tell you this, your best years are yet to come but that does not mean it’s going to be easy.

In fact I can guarantee that you will face adversity along the way and for most of you it’ll be the toughest thing you’ve ever had to face in your life. I will also tell you that every successful person you meet or talk to will say that it was because of that adversity that they were given the opportunity to reach new heights that they never thought possible.

For me it was my shoulder injury back in 2005. December 31, 2005. I was playing for the San Diego chargers. I dislocated my right shoulder going into an off season in which I did not have a contract, did not have a job. When you have that kind of injury at the quarter back position there’s not a lot of people that come calling or knocking.

So at the time I thought this is probably the worst thing that could have ever happened to me but now I look back at it four years later and I say it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me because it brought me to New Orleans.

There are many others that have faced that adversity and have been in those similar circumstances or situations.I’ll give you a few examples, Steve Jobs, you might know him. He’s theC.E.O. of apple. He was adopted as young baby. He went to college and dropped out after his first year. He ended up starting Apple when he was 20 years old in his basement but by age 30 he was fired from his position as C.E.O. when he had a falling out with his partner and with the board at Apple.

For the next few years there was some soul searching for him but in the end he started another company. You might have heard of it, PixarAnimation which ended up getting bought out by Disney for almost eight billion dollars and then by another company that Apple ended up buying a few years later for five hundred million. He was right back where he was 20 years before as the C.E.O. of Apple and there he is today doing some absolutely remarkable things.

What he would say, what I’ve heard him say is that it was that adversity that he faced when he was kicked to the curb, so to speak, from the company that he founded where he really gained strength and more motivation to go forth and do remarkable things, things that he would not have been able to accomplish had he not gone through what he went through at age 30.

Another example is Ellen DeGeneres. We all know Ellen; she grew up right down the road. She used to go to Saints games at halftime at the old stadium. I’ve heard Ellen talk about the moment when she came out and announced that she was gay. At that point she was having a pretty successful career but after coming out she was out of work for three years. People would not give her the opportunities that they had before. To her that was the toughest thing she ever had to go through but in the end she was being true to herself.

She then received a small opportunity to perhaps host her own TV show, her own talk show and I think we all know how that has gone. She is perhaps one of the most, if not the most, successful talk show host in history. Certainly by being a New Orleanian we love her to death. We know what she has meant to this community, not only to our community but to the country and to the world. She is a source of inspiration and somebody who would sit here and tell you that had she not gone through what she went through during those three years, she would not be where she is today.

So once again the lesson being that adversity is an opportunity.Adversity will make you stronger. Adversity will mold you into the person that you are meant to be. You all probably remember the kick in the super bowl right? How could we forget that?

I’ll tell you the story behind that. We had two weeks to prepare for the super bowl and I remember Shawn Peyton came into the meeting at the beginning of that two week preparation for the SuperBowl and said we have a kick that we’re putting in the plan. It’s not a matter of if we’re going to run it; it’s when we are going to run it. It’s going to happen and sure enough it worked, thank god.

The lesson is, it’s not a matter of if you will face adversity in your life but when. So when adversity knocks on your door cease it as an opportunity. For that adversity is being put in your life for a reason. It is God’s way of providing you with the strength and the tools to face future challenges and to mold you into the person that he meant for you to be. In the end it is this adversity that will allow you to accomplish things in life that you originally thought were reserved only for your dreams.

My second piece advice to you is this, find what you love to do and then figure out a way to get paid for it. Sounds pretty simple doesn’t it? Some of you out there think you know exactly what you want to do and then there are others that probably have no idea. That’s okay, because in a year from now those that think they know exactly what they want to do, they might not have any idea at that point. Those that don’t know what to do you might have found your passion by then. My point is, be patient and don’t settle. The only way to do great work is to love what you do and as with every matter of the heart you will know when you find it.

My third piece advice is to approach every opportunity with an attitude of gratitude and a mindset that whatever you encounter you will leave it better than when you arrived. We have all been part of that here in New Orleans but why stop here? In everything you do in life, leave your mark. Be a great steward of the community and to society and to whatever business you’re involved and understand that part of your purpose in life is to leave whatever you touch better than when you found it. So leave your mark and leave it better than you found it.

Number four, life goes fast. I was sitting in your seats ten years ago. Now it’s hard to think that that was ten years ago because it feels like it was yesterday. I guess my point there is, don’t forget to enjoy the moment and reflect back on the journey from time to time.

For me, standing on that podium after we won the super bowl was a moment, one of the defining moments of my life. What made it even more special is the fact that I was holding my son and the reflection on every thing that we had been through as a city and as a team to get to that point.

As we watched the confetti come down and the world champions come across the jumbotron and looking out at the people going crazy, beads flying everywhere, we recognized what a journey that had been and how special that was. There’s no city, no organization, no group of people who deserve it more. I promise you that. The journey is not over. We want another one.

Also, don’t forget to enjoy the little things life. Sometimes you get going so fast, I feel like the last three months have been like that for me. Don’t forget to enjoy the little things in life, watching the sunset with the one that you love, taking a walk in the park, sitting in rocking chairs on the front porch watching the street cars go by, or throwing the ball with your child out in the front yard. You work too hard not to enjoy those little things.

My last piece of advice is, don’t forget why you were put on this earth. We were all put on this earth to serve others. Sometimes the more successful that you get, people tend to forget that. It becomes more about how they can serve you as opposed to how you can serve others. So don’t forget, no matter how successful you become, which you all will, to serve others.

As you all sit here on graduation day,I believe everyone can agree that we’ve all been blessed with some great opportunities in our lives. Be appreciative and respectful of those opportunities and never take them for granted.With that mindset just think about being able to give back what has been given to you. Take the time to make a difference in the life of somebody less fortunate. It’s amazing that the more generous you are and the more you choose to serve others the happier you will be.

Now for the words you’ve been waiting for, in closing I’d like to leave you with a quote. I could have chosen many profound quotes from presidents, C.E.O.’s, or philosophers but I’m choosing one from my grandfather. He is 85 years old; he still lives on a ranch, herding cows in East Texas.

A quote I heard all the time from him when I was growing up was this, according to my grandpa, “There are three types of people in this world. There are those that make it happen. There are those who watch it happen and then there are those that wake up one day and say ‘What the heck happened?’ So which one are you?” is what he would tell me.

SoI leave you today by first saying congratulations the 2010 graduating class of Loyola University and now let’s go make it happen!

I didn’t know that honor was coming and it kind of wrecks my opening because I was going to tell you that it is such an honor to be here. As a man who was never able to college. I was the first in my family to go to college; I attended one semester but I couldn’t afford any more than that. I am humbled and honored.

I love you too, if only you were single and you were a woman. We’d be set.

I want to thank the chancellor and the University also, for inviting me to speak. I understand the courage that it took to invite me to speak for a myriad of reasons, my faith just being one of them. I want you to know that I understand that the invitation to speak today is not meant as an endorsement of my faith, but I also want you to understand that my agreeing to speak here today is an endorsement of your faith.

This is a time where we all need to come together. We may have differences but we need to find those things that unite us. We need to find the courage within inside of ourself. As I was thinking what I could possibly say to you, what encouragement I could possibly give to you, I look at the things that are facing you today, the worst economy in generations, the Euro on the road to collapse, our spending ourselves into oblivion, no one in Washington seems to care about debt anymore. Unemployment is at ten percent.

We live at a time where you must have great courage; you must have great faith. We live at a time where it seems truth is on the run. Last week, I heard the President speak at a ceremony much like this. He said that there is now too much information available, that it is sometimes too confusing. This is a course that has been charted before in the past and it always ends with those who are willing to burn books. There is no such thing as too much information. There is no such thing as a question that should not be asked. There is no such thing as a book that shouldn’t be read.

In the one semester and the one class that I took at Yale University, I sat feeling so out of place, I took it when I was thirty; I was just looking for answers. I had been educating myself and reading as much as I could myself and I raised my hand, and I asked the professor a question and he said “Who are you reading, Mr. Beck?” I told him. He said “Don’t read that guy, here is what you need to read, you need to read this guy.” I said “All right.” and I wrote it down. The next week, I raised my hand again, I said, “Excuse me professor I just have another question.” I asked him the question and he looked at me, he paused and he said, “Are you still reading the book I told you not to read?” I stayed silent. He said, “Did I not tell you to read this man instead?” I said, “Yes you did sir, and I read that, now back to my original question.” I had read what he wanted me to read but no one should stop you from searching for information. It’s not enough to know that you think that this man of authority thinks that the other one is wrong. You must understand and decide yourself. It is your God-given right and your God-given responsibility. Use your own brain.

Anyone who doesn’t understand, anyone who says that you are not capable of sifting through all the information and finding truth is someone who does not understand God and the power of the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you. The Spirit is an amazing tool. Rely on God; do your own work, and ask Him is this right. He will reveal the truth. We’re living at a time right now where if you’re paying attention at all there’s something inside of you that says there’s something wrong. Something’s not right. That’s the alarm bell going off. The Lord gave us these rights. He asked us to protect them, to guard them. He installed an alarm bell-as your rights are being taken that’s what your gut is telling you now. It is a gift and don’t dismiss it.

I’ve been reading a lot about the first evangelist in America, George Whitefield. George Whitefield was an amazing man. George Whitefield went out in the fields and ploughed them, planted seeds and out of those seeds came the American Revolution. He was an amazing man. He spoke his mind while people threw rocks at him. Have no fear; Courage; Speak the truth. He reminds me a lot of the stories of Moses. Moses was one of his favorite stories to tell, examples to give. As I went back in my Scriptures and I was reading the Moses story last week, I couldn’t help but think how I wouldn’t have said those things to the Lord, especially when he gave me the staff. At one point I said in an interview, I believe I am the Lord’s most impertinent child. It was actually related in the press by this reporter as Glenn Beck says he believes he’s one of God’s most important children. There is a difference but usually the media doesn’t notice those small things. I have a different relationship with the Lord, sometimes he just tolerates me. I think if I would have been standing there, I would have said exactly what Moses said: Who am I? Who am I to say these things? Why would they ever believe me? That’s when the Lord said, Take this. I would have responded, A stick? You give me stick? It wasn’t just a stick-it was a symbol of faith. First it changed into a snake, great, but as Moses understood, as Moses grew, that stick parted the waters. The Lord gives us all our own stick. He gives us every tool we need, and while we as humans may look at it and say, what am I going to do with a stick? He knows-trust in Him. The easy stuff is the answer.

Right now you have the greatest minds all over the world trying to figure out what to do, what to do, what to do. Turn to God and live. I think of the advice that I could possibly give to you and first among is that-turn to God and live. You have all that you need; you are powerful. There is a reason for you being here-find it. Life is only what you make of it, nothing more, nothing less. You will be a slave or you will pick up your stick and chart a new course. It is only for you to find the truth of who you are. Moses saw God as a bush and a fire that burned that did not consume. That’s important to understand: God is the truth and it will set fires. It’s not anger but the truth will consume everything that is not true. It will turn things upside down. But His promise to each of us is to stand in that fire, to stand in that truth, and it will not consume us. The world is full of lies: You can have it all. Character doesn’t matter. Money, fame will make you happy. All of those things in your lifetime, all of those things in the short days ahead will be consumed, but stand in the blaze and recognize what time it is and who you are.

A Scripture that changed my life was Ezekiel 33: I don’t want to be the man who brings the news. There are many things that I say that I do not want to say, but each of us as we come to the understanding of what time it is, we have a responsibility for the blood of everyone who could have heard our voice, will be on our hands. You are a watchman on the tower-we all are. We must stand and use the Lord as our shield. Root ourselves in the Gospel, put our feet in the Gospel of peace, but be unmovable. Stand for Liberty.

I have no idea what God’s will is for this great country of ours. I have no idea what comes next. I have no idea why His finger has been on the back of Columbus. It was His breath that opened up those sails and pushed those ships here. It’s is God’s finger that pushed Columbus back when he became arrogant. It was God that spoke to the pilgrims. They didn’t want to come here-they were going to New Guinea. The last place they wanted to come was here. They got on their knees. If you read their diaries, you see that God spoke to them and said be a good and righteous people. Stand with me and I will protect you for this land will be special. It is God’s finger that wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. This is God’s country. These are God’s rights. I have no idea what He wants us to do with them other than protect them and stand with Him.

You will find in your life that you can do it the hard way or you can do it the easy way. That’s I think, what God said to me most of my life. We can do this the hard way, we can take you downtown, or we can do it the easy way. Most of my life, I did it the hard way. I testify to you, do not do it the hard way. Also, don’t ever pray for humility because that one he’ll pass out in spades. That one he can be in the middle of a conversation with someone else, and say hang on just a second, someone’s asking for humility-zap. He will humble you; remain humble. And please, don’t underestimate the power of the atonement. As a man who needed the atonement, as a man who could walk not another step, as a man who about followed in my mother’s footsteps-when I was 13, she took her life; when I was 30, I was ready to take mine. And I read the promise: He will carry your burdens. I made Him a promise: You keep your word and I will keep mine. You know, I was probably a little stupid or desperate when I made that promise because I now know He will never break His promise, so it’s all up to me. That stinks. Don’t underestimate the power of the atonement. It is the most powerful thing you will ever encounter. It will truly change your life, but it will also handcuff you for the rest of your life if you understand it. You will then be in a position of having to stand where he asks you to stand, and I don’t know about you but sometimes the Lord just says: Go stand over there for a while. Yeah, but I don’t understand why. Just go stand over there for a while. Yeah, but it doesn’t make any sense. Just stand over there for a while. You will find much of your life standing places you don’t understand, but then all of a sudden, you’ll find your place in a place like this and it will all make sense.

You are the best of us. I believe you have been held back for this time. You are the strength, you are the future. So many will be lost in the days ahead. So many will be looking for answers. The answers are not that hard, they just sometimes appear like a stick. When Moses was still wandering around in the desert, and the Israelites kept saying come on, are we there yet? Come on, I’m hot, I’m cold, I’m hungry, my feet hurt, I got to go potty, Moses finally just looked up and said Lord, I can’t take anymore, just take me now will you? That’s when the Lord sent the fiery serpents, and what did he tell Moses to do? He said pick up the stick, fashion a serpent on top and tell everybody, look and live. Tell everyone you know as they are looking and seeking answers and they become more and more desperate, as ridiculous as it sounds, look to God and live.

My daughter just started her first year in college. As I was flying here today, I didn’t feel like I had anything really to share with you that you haven’t already learned here. I took out my journal and I looked up the things that I wrote my daughter as she was sitting there, listening, for her first day as she was coming in as a freshman. The things I wrote that I want to tell my daughter. May I share them with you.

You are never alone, and there is never trouble that is beyond help. Your father loves you and so does your heavenly Father. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow may never come, but as long as we have today, we can change the world. Question with boldness. Read what they tell you not to read. Challenge everything. The educated of this time are growing arrogant, and arrogance leads to darkness. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, however, sanitizer is a must especially in New York City. In New York City, honey, it’s best most times just not to touch. Look for the exits, it may save your life. Respect others-know they are most likely afraid just like you; in fact, the more arrogant and the more forceful they become, I have found the more afraid they really are.

The worst thing that you could do in life is to dishonor yourself or your family and then living life without setting it right. Marry for love, marry for laughs, but most importantly as my wife Tanya taught me, marry for God. Without God, life’s storms are too strong to withstand. Wealth and fame are an illusion. We’ve been rich, we’ve been poor, we’ve been happy at both times. The only times I’ve been truly miserable is when I was lying to myself or to others. Alcohol and drugs make life easier for a very short time and then they destroy. There is no experience that is bad-experience just is. It is what you do with that experience-will you use it to shape your life for the better, to become a stronger person, or will you allow those experiences to smother and destroy? Call 911 first, then call your dad. Always have a picture on your desk of someone you admire. Don’t let life pound over you wave after wave. You’re not a rock. Learn from the waves, learn from the tides and the currents. Create power with what you learn. Choose to sail-refresh, and do not drift. I am that I am is the most powerful phrase in any language as it is the name of God and never take it in vain. Use it to create who you want-I ams

I understand there were bets as to whether they would allow me to keep my beret on ...

I'm probably better known for my destructive tendencies on the Discovery Channel's MythBusters than anything else. You've seen us blow up cement trucks, create an earthquake machine and even seen us try to get old Chevys to fly, but behind all of that havoc is a lot of discipline and drive — brainstorming, creativity, research, planning, budgeting, project management, design, construction, testing, and, throughout the show — analyzing what we are doing and trying to explain it clearly to the viewers.

While all the explosions, destruction and dangerous experiments seem to be my signature, what I really take joy and pride in — what means the most to me about my career — is not the wanton destruction and television fame, it's the passion for exploration, the curiosity, the hunger for knowledge that we demonstrate on the show. Our aim is to encourage new scientists, new engineers, and the new problem solvers in every discipline.

When I was a child I lived on an apple orchard right near here in King of Prussia. It's nice to be back.

Later my family moved to Indiana, and we lived on an apple orchard there as well. So, I come from farm stock. My relatives have names like Uncle Ezrah and Aunt Murdy. I often get asked if I blew up a lot of things when I was a child, but I acquired that "talent" later in life. I did manage to destroy a fair amount of farm equipment as I discovered it got me out of a lot of chores.

Now here we are today. A few miles from my own beginnings. And you, the class of 2010, are ready to take on the challenges of the world.

You are graduates in business, in arts and sciences, in engineering, in nursing, and law. You are Wildcats.

I have collaborated for some years now with the Villanova engineering staff on numerous projects, from designing and building the Wavecam system that covers your sporting events, to working with your professors on the "disasters at sea" project for the Office of Naval Research. We've designed a flying car. We even have a robot design that may get sent to Mars. Right now we are in the middle of developing new types of armor to protect our soldiers from roadside bombs.

And so the Villanova engineering staff has embraced me as one of their own.I am both honored and humbled to accept my Doctorate of Engineering from this university. I sincerely thank Father President, the board of trustees and the faculty for granting me this honor. I too, am now a proud Wildcat.As your finals are over, and you look toward the future, you should reflect and ask yourselves: How am I different today? How am I different from when I first walked on campus?

That is, after all, an underlying point of getting an education: to change yourselves for the better. I am sure you've all improved in many ways. And yet, no matter how great the books, how clever the professors, and how hard you studied, you can't possibly have learned everything you'll ever need to know, so where exactly does that leave you?

While I wouldn't encourage people to be exactly like me — there's a scary thought — I am nothing if not adventurous, and I have observed some things that I think may be helpful to you, things that have come from my own peculiar path. The first is something that seems to escape a lot of people.

People are often so goal oriented, so focused on the finish line, that it's all too easy to lose track of how we are getting there, and what we are actually doing at any given point.

I'm not just talking about just stopping now and then to smell the roses.

My thought is that the best way to move ahead is to focus on asking the right questions along the way. It sometimes amounts to placing more importance on the question than the answer. Something as simple as asking yourself what you are really looking for is often missed, but it becomes evident how important it is when you realize that once you have a very clear idea about what question is, the answer is often just sitting there waiting for you.

This is where I really get excited; this is where the curiosity, the joy of exploration comes in. This IS the big adventure! Regardless of your academic discipline, you should ask yourselves: What's over there, around that corner? What will happen if I do this? What do I really want? Why did that happen?

Just because you are an adult does not mean you should stop playing with things like a child or even like a puppy does. Poke something with a stick, TRY things, experiment. Run around and wave your arms. (Just not right now.)

A lot of people just aren't so persistent about asking such questions — and find themselves someplace they never wanted to be. Others can't wait to see what is around the next corner, on the top of the next hill. Those are the people that are curious, people who are asking questions and who are actually GOING someplace.

And of course there is the word — should — as in should I be doing this? Ethical behavior, taking self responsibility — admirable traits that you can only maintain by constantly questioning yourself and your world.On the other end of the spectrum, you can't just go around asking unanswerable questions and waving your arms — you have to go after those answers, make decisions, roll up those sleeves and DO something. Realize you may be making the wrong decision, but take your best shot and go full speed ahead.

At this point things change. Now you need to focus. Your odds of success in things you attempt go up radically if you are methodical and diligent. If you want to have a say in how your lives turn out, you need to be practical about it.

Your classes here at Villanova have all pointed this out, at least indirectly, in that they all had a beginning, middle, and end, and your professors went about delivering their material to you in an orderly way that would make sense to you. Your life should be no different.

I want to emphasize this because I've tried all sorts of things, and I've learned that I can pretty much do anything I've wanted to as long as I was methodical and diligent about it. It may not sound very exciting really, but it works! I've hired scores of people over the years for various businesses, and I can tell you that just being methodical and diligent will get you any job you want and keep you in it if you want it to.

I would not let it stop there either; apply it to your personal lives as well. Most of your lives will be spent outside of work and careers, and so the quality of your lives will be the better for the same reasons. After all, all the greatness you may achieve in your careers doesn't amount to a whole lot if your personal life is a mess.

Lastly, an important point. Since I hopefully have convinced all you graduates to run around playfully asking questions, while being diligent and methodical, there still is more to leading a successful life and more to being a worthy graduate of Villanova.

Of all the things you do in life or all the questions you ponder, I would like you to keep kindness at the top of the list. Are you being kind in all you do? In your professional life? In your family life? In your dealings with others? Are you kind? Shouldn't you be? We owe it to our children, to our children's children, and to all the other things in our world to be kind to them and each other.

There is no question you can ask that will show that this isn't so. So ask those questions, be diligent and be methodical — these traits will all help you progress in the grand adventures you will all face. But to make the adventures all worthwhile, to make your successes truly rewarding ... I ask you to be kind in everything you do, without fail and above all.

Thank you.

As a kid, I spent my summers with my grandparents on their ranch in Texas. I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially “Days of our Lives.” My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we’d join the caravan. We’d hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather’s car, and off we’d go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips. On one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was driving. And my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.

At that age, I’d take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I’d calculate our gas mileage -- figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending. I’d been hearing an ad campaign about smoking. I can’t remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life: I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I’d come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, “At two minutes per puff, you’ve taken nine years off your life!”

I have a vivid memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected. I expected to be applauded for my cleverness and arithmetic skills. “Jeff, you’re so smart. You had to have made some tricky estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some division.” That’s not what happened. Instead, my grandmother burst into tears. I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man. He had never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this realm with my grandparents and no way to gauge what the consequences might be. We stopped beside the trailer. My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, “Jeff, one day you’ll understand that it’s harder to be kind than clever.”

What I want to talk to you about today is the difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they’re given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you’re not careful, and if you do, it’ll probably be to the detriment of your choices.

This is a group with many gifts. I’m sure one of your gifts is the gift of a smart and capable brain. I’m confident that’s the case because admission is competitive and if there weren’t some signs that you’re clever, the dean of admission wouldn’t have let you in.

Your smarts will come in handy because you will travel in a land of marvels. We humans -- plodding as we are -- will astonish ourselves. We’ll invent ways to generate clean energy and a lot of it. Atom by atom, we’ll assemble tiny machines that will enter cell walls and make repairs. This month comes the extraordinary but also inevitable news that we’ve synthesized life. In the coming years, we’ll not only synthesize it, but we’ll engineer it to specifications. I believe you’ll even see us understand the human brain. Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Galileo, Newton -- all the curious from the ages would have wanted to be alive most of all right now. As a civilization, we will have so many gifts, just as you as individuals have so many individual gifts as you sit before me.

How will you use these gifts? And will you take pride in your gifts or pride in your choices?

I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I’d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles -- something that simply couldn’t exist in the physical world -- was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I’d been married for a year. I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn’t work since most startups don’t, and I wasn’t sure what would happen after that. MacKenzie (also a Princeton grad and sitting here in the second row) told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I’d been a garage inventor. I’d invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn’t work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings. I’d always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.

I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, “That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn’t already have a good job.” That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I’m proud of that choice.

Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life -- the life you author from scratch on your own -- begins.

How will you use your gifts? What choices will you make?

Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?

Will you follow dogma, or will you be original?

Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?

Will you wilt under criticism, or will you follow your convictions?

Will you bluff it out when you’re wrong, or will you apologize?

Will you guard your heart against rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?

Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?

When it’s tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?

Will you be a cynic, or will you be a builder?

Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story. Thank you and good luck!

I am deeply gratified to be among you today, extremely honored to join you as a newly minted alumnus of this college with the honorary degree that I gratefully and humbly receive today.

You are embarking on a new phase of life after four years that will always be among the most remarkable of your lives. At the same time, Connecticut College is embarking on its second hundred years, preparing for a centennial next year, just as 100 years ago a board of trustees was preparing to launch a new college in this place. And I believe that our nation is preparing to embark on a new journey as well.

We have felt the earth move beneath our feet in recent years. I-banks are down; I phones are up. Artificial Life has become a reality this week in the lab dishes of scientist Craig Venter. He has created a new genome to guide the destiny of a bacterial cell. We will need to do something perhaps harder, to shape a new social genome to guide the destiny of a crowded planet.

What operating principles, what priorities, can guide us? Strange of you to ask an economist, I might say. The best definition that I’ve heard of my profession recently is that an economist is a person put on Earth to make astrologers look good. Another definition, perhaps more useful for today, is that an economist is a person who, when he or she sees that something works in practice, tries to find if it works in theory. 

Let me pursue that line with you today.

What is working and what is not working in our world? That will be one of your life’s open-ended take-home exam questions. Yet the good news is that the exam is openbook, that you can (and indeed must) work in groups, and that as long as you work hard, honestly, and diligently, you can keep revising your answer!

I believe that we find two strands of thinking pulling at our society today, two ideas in a contest for our attention and energies. And our fate, especially your fate, will be determined by which of these directions ends up dominating.

One strand is represented by the new Arizona immigration code, in which the police are empowered to chase down anybody they believe looks suspicious. Or by last Friday’s Court of Appeals decision in Washington, ruling that the US government can hold nonAmericans in indefinite custody and deny them even a day in court. Or by the $100 billion the US Government will spend this year in Afghanistan to try in vain to subdue a country we barely know and understand. We now stand at the verge of a new bloody military campaign in the city of Kandahar. Or by the CEO of Goldman Sachs — I can assure you not even a distant part of this Sachs family — proclaiming that his firm is doing God’s Work, even as Goldman also proclaims its right to deceive its clients as it markets toxic assets. Buyers beware. The other strand is represented the thousands of American volunteers who decamped to Haiti in response to the devastating earthquake. Or by the countless volunteers among you and your friends who have joined Teach for America, Unite for Sight, Partners in Health, the Millennium Villages Project, the ONE Campaign, RESULTS, the Millennium Campus Network, and a host of other organizations all based on idea of global values linked up with local communities. Or by the students working long hours in the Connecticut College  laboratories to identify the next target for disease control, or the next method to conserve biological diversity. Or by the countless online innovators among you who have created social networks to defend gays and lesbians, disabled individuals, illegal immigrants, and the poor and destitute who lack a voice in the corridors of power.

One strand is based on an age-old idea: the world is dangerous and competitiveness, and we need to take what we can before someone else grabs it away. Life is harsh and sometimes even ruthless. Only the tough survive.

The other strand is based on an equally age-old idea: that humankind is a species of designers, problem solvers, and seekers; that we don’t have to accept our follies and our missteps. Yes, of course our human natures are flawed, we are wired to see the world as “us versus them.” But we can know ourselves, recognize the limits, and most importantly, recognize our common humanity, and thereby aim to do better.

I don’t deny the need for you and me, and for America, to be vigilant in the face of threats. But I do deny that we should define the world by its dangers rather than by its opportunities. There is, I would assert, an inherent benefit for all of us in choosing the more optimistic course, the one based on a vision of cooperation and mutual gain — what economists would call the gains from trade and the benefits of cooperation. When we choose the aggressive and defensive course, we are condemned to spend vast sums merely in opposing others; we are condemned to miss the opportunities for finding mutual advantage through cooperation; and we become, wittingly or not, reckless gamblers with the fate of the planet: making the spread of war, environmental destruction, and social division all that much more likely.

As tough as the economy is today, the financial crisis since 2008 has at least given us the chance to open our eyes and look around. What do we see? We see a Congress and
White House still overrun by lobbyists. We see an environment being lost to oil spills, carbon-dioxide emissions, and relentless land-use change. We see an American society in which the wealthiest 1 percent of the people have more net worth than the bottom 90 percent of Americans, where a typical CEO makes 300 times the income of the average workers, and where the world’s 1,011 billionaires, with a combined net worth of $3.5 trillion dollars, have in their collective wealth the power to feed the world and heal the sick – yet most have not yet begun to do so.

The waste of it all is startling. Our military spending in Afghanistan this year will be 10 times that country’s national income, yet instead of raising up that country, which we could so easily do, our actions are likely to sink it still deeper into  misery, while we wonder why our actions are so ineffectual. America will lose an estimated 10 percent of our national income to crime, as we do each year, but we will still reject the spending of around 1 percent of national income on the kinds of day care and early-childhood education programs that can raise the skills and literacy of poor children, and thereby help to deter a slide into costly dead-end criminal behavior. We will spend billions cleaning up the oil mess in the Gulf of Mexico, and hundreds or thousands of times that trying vainly to clean up after climate change, but then we are as likely as not to turn down the small investments in research and development that could propel a new age of renewable energy.

What can explain such profligacy at a time of resource scarcity, when we need to make every dollar go as far as it can go? Part of the answer is poor organization and lack of knowledge. I remember looking recently at a newspaper picture of President Obama’s Afghanistan war cabinet, the one making the decision to send an additional 40,000 troops to Afghanistan this year. As you gazed at the picture, looking at the seventeen generals, politicians, and advisors, there wasn’t even one single expert on the culture or language of the country we have occupied.

Another part of the explanation is greed. The politicians and insider companies have made a pact in which the politicians deliver the policies and the companies deliver the campaign contributions. The lobbying has been so successful that the deregulation of banks, automobiles, health insurers, and oil companies has nearly brought us to ruin.

But much of the explanation is a widespread pessimism, a lack of faith in humanity, the opposition to the fundamental idea that we can do better if we try. Of course we can. A President John Kennedy once said, Our problems are manmade — therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable — and we believe they can do it again.

That is the idea and spirit that I ask you to carry forward from Connecticut College today. During your years at Connecticut College, you have been part of a community seeking the truth; part of a community drawing strength from diversity, yet grounded in a common humanity; part of a community founded on the deepest faith that knowledge is power to be deployed for the common good. Or, as the mission puts it, students will be educated to “put the liberal arts into action for the global society.”

With the skills that you have learned, you are not only empowered to find your own personal way around the dangerous twists and turns we now call the US economy, but also around the challenges that your generation will face, and that will define the future of the planet. You have been empowered to help fight hunger, poverty, and disease in the world, knowing full well that a tiny fraction of what we waste on war could harness the cutting edge technologies to raise the standard of life and preserve the peace;

You have been empowered to make choices to save the planet from our own neglect; to vote for climate change legislation, and to tell the climate deniers like the Wall Street Journal that their ignorance is risking your future and that of your own children who soon enough will be your greatest hope and legacy;

You have been empowered to say that enough is enough with the nasty ways that we
have treated America’s poor and neglected in recent years, that the view that we owe
each other nothing but sharp elbows and ruthless competition is a philosophy that
deserves no bailouts from the American people;

And most importantly, you have been empowered to know that we are entering a new
era, in which the US is but one of many powers, and in which our fate, and that of the world, will depend much more on our ideas and values than on America’s weaponry and military bases.

Take your values from Connecticut College today – values of community, diversity, knowledge, and mission – and show what you can do to improve the world. This is your turn, the challenge of your generation.

Congratulations to the graduating Class of 2010.

Thank you.

I am truly honored to be here this morning. My name is Jimmy Tingle and that is my real name and I was born right here in Cambridge Massachusetts. I am an unlikely choice to give a commencement address at Harvard because quite frankly my friend, I am not a scholar, which will become increasingly more evident as I proceed. I am a comedian by profession, and I started to perform in here in the early 1980s, actually I did strip performing right down here in Harvard Square. I’ve travelled all around the world performing standing up comedy. I don’t want to brag but two years ago I performed in Europe and I just like to say: “Excellent Country.”You know what’s nice for being here this morning, you actually get that joke.

Actually I am from a long line of intellectuals, growing up here in Cambridge, we lived quite near a college. My father owned and drove taxi cabs, here in Harvard Square, he will pick up Harvard professors, they would tell them things, he would come home and tell us. For generations, Harvard has given scholarships to students from Cambridge and students from all over the world who could meet the academic requirements. Starting from the third grade, my dear sweet mother who was here this morning would say to me: “Jimmy, if you study really hard, some day you could go to Harvard.” By the sixth grade, she stopped telling me that. By the eighth grade, our whole neighborhood had their eye set on Harvard, not so much for scholarships but because it was an excellent place to steal bicycles.

I can remember running through this very yard, some forty-years ago, being chased by the Harvard students, the Harvard faculty and The Harvard Police Department. Other college campuses in the 1960s were bitterly divided between the students and the administration over civil rights and the war in Vietnam. But here in Harvard, my friends and I were able to unite: students, faculty and law enforcement. It was in this very yard that I had my first spiritual awakening. As I was running I started to pray, please God, please God, don’t let me get caught. I will never do it again. My mother will kill me. She always wanted me to go to Harvard; this isn’t what she meant. And then I realized I was an altar boy. I was a Catholic, I should have been praying before I tried to take the bicycle.

And I just want to say to the alumni gathered here this morning on behalf of myself and all the other miss-guided youth of Cambridge and Greater Boston who may have un-justified taken your bicycles … We are sorry.

And to the graduates, many of you will go on to position of great power and influence in business and politics and government and the temptations to cut corners, to lie, to steal, to cheat will be formidable. My advice to you today is simply this: “Ask for guidance before you commit the crime”. Trust me; it is much less embarrassing to ask for help privately than to beg for forgiveness at graduation. And I am so grateful; I am so grateful that the petty crimes of my youth were not successful, for had my dishonest behavior been rewarded, I may not be with you here today. My life may have taken at different turns, and I may have ended up on Wall Street.

I’d always wanted to this school but always felt that was too late getting courage from family, friends, and colleagues, and my mum, and my wife Catherine, I put in an application anyway. And like of you who was absolutely over-joyed when that letter of acceptant came in the mail. I couldn’t believe this, after all this years I have actually been accepted to Harvard; they must really need a commencement speaker.

In this entire year people has asked me Jimmy why would an comedian want to go to Harvard, the same reason all of you wanted to go Harvard, we got in. And all of us have faced challenges getting here today and still more academic challenges when class started. My biggest academic challenge was the quantitative mathematics requirement for graduation. Unfortunately I had to take statistics. Fortunately we had had a wonderful and dedicated and great teacher, Dr. Hughes Helen who was kind enough to arrange extra help sessions tor students who was struggling with the material. I went to every single extra help sessions she offered.It was always very similar scenario, me and 19 students from other countries. Countries often in conflict with one another, India and Pakistan, Turkey and Greece, Israelis and Palestinians, all of us were helping one another, all of us learning from one another, all of us supporting one another across racial, ethnic and religious line and I say this as a native Bostonian, all of us with English as a second language.

All of us are here today because somebody helped us, whether it was family, or friends and colleges or teachers or administrators or scholarships or God or a higher power, someone or something helped us get here today, and now it is our job to help others. And that is education, and that is human progress in its simplest form and I believe very very strongly that with the right amount of physical, spiritual and intellectual help, almost anything in this world is possible. All of the students in those extra helps sessions passed those courses, some of those students actually got an A in statistics, I personally got a B, which for me was a miracle, actually in the spirit of honesty, a B minus which was a minor miracle, but if I could get the help that I needed in Statistic to get a B minus in Statistic in Quantitative Mathematics at Graduate School, at Harvard, there is hope for world peace.

What a great privilege to be here with you. President Maxey, Dean Smith, faculty and staff, thanks for the invitation. But today, today is your day, class of 2010. You’re very quiet. I don’t know what’s happening here. I told the president, after the presentations made by your fellow students, I don’t need to say anything. Quite extraordinary.

Many of you don’t realize this—it’s a little early for you—but do you know the definition of a mid-life crisis? A mid-life crisis is when you get to the top rung of your ladder only to realize that you leaned it against the wrong wall. Now I’m going to take the few minutes I have with you here to do absolutely everything I can to help you lean your ladder against the right wall.

First of all, I hope you never in your life have a job. Here’s why.

The word ‘job’ comes from the Old English word ‘gobbe’—G-O-B-B-E— because back in the old days you were paid by the ‘lump’ of something. Like you were paid by how many lumps you carried from one place to the other. So if you have a job, you’ve got a load of something. I don’t want you to have a job; I want you to have a ‘work.’

‘Work’ comes from the Greek word ‘erg’—E-R-G. Where are the physics majors?  Any physics majors in here? OK, I’m going to try this. I think from my physics that an erg is how many calories it takes to move one gram one centimeter. An erg is a measure of force directed in with a purpose. So quit your job and find your work, even if it’s in the same place. Don’t ever, ever have a job. Always, always have a work.

My dear friend and colleague Mike Steven, who just retired as the CEO of Aetna International up in Canada, told me one time, he said, “The problem, John, that we have is that when we were trained to be leaders and managers, back in the 1950s, we were taught to train people that came to work to treat the company as if it was their ultimate source of meaning in their life. To make the business, the company, into God,” he said.

“The problem is we succeeded. Because now when you take away someone’s job, they’re devastated because they have equated their life with their job. Please, please don’t ever have a job.

My older son, who is a rock musician—he’s also a Web site designer, but that just funds his music habit—one time said to me, “Dad, I don’t think people have careers anymore.” He said, “What I think they have is a series of gigs.”

I think that’s beautiful. You’re going to have a series of gigs—some of you may have careers, but most of you are going to have a series of gig. You’re going to have to find some thread to string these gigs together, some greater purpose, some kind of backbone or spine to put these gigs together.

I’ve got a suggestion for you. Why not turn the work place—wherever you’re going—into a classroom for your own higher development? Think of when you walk in the door to work or when you wake up in the morning and boot up, right? When you wake up—some of you boot up. I don’t know—do you boot up in the morning? I hope so. When you boot up in the morning, what comes on? Why not take that attitude into your workplace and see the people that are there as your faculty. The curriculum is just all the stuff that happens to you during the day. It’s a perfect place to practice and grow and develop into who you were created to be. Which is why we’re here in the first place, I think.

There will be homework, but this is work that takes you home. My point is:  you don’t need to change yourself. Ever. You need to come home to yourself. And that changes everything. You want to come home to yourself, I suggest trying on these five questions.

First question is: What confronts you? What confronts you? If you are in the jungle and a tiger comes up on you, the people that I’ve talked to who live there say, “What’s the human instinct to do?” What would the human instinct to do if a tiger came up on you suddenly in the jungle? Run, great. When you run, sixteen million years of evolutionary wisdom kicks in. The tiger’s brain sees that small, slow figure trying to run away, the yummy one with the crunchy center, and the tiger’s brain says what? Lunch. Exactly. The tiger cannot stop itself. It is hard-wired to attack and kill a small, slow figure running away.

If you have a kitten, for instance, and you pull a string ten times in front of that kitten, how many times out of ten will it try to grab the string? Ten times. It’s hard-wired. So if a tiger is facing you and you run away, your chances are zero.

But the people who live there tell me if you turn and face that tiger—Hah! Now he may still eat you; this is not a magic story, here, OK?—but they say he’ll stop and think about it. Now this may seem like a trivial thing to you, but if your chances are zero if you run—Where are the math majors?—if you face it, what are your chances? Something greater than zero, OK? If it’s one in a million, I’m there. I’ll take it. OK?

So, where are the tigers in your life? What confronts you? It might be a conversation you’ve been putting off, a decision you need to make, it may be as simple as sitting here. This moment confronting you.

Second question: What are you bringing to this confrontation with this moment? What are you bringing to this moment? Hopes, fears, predictions, history. History with this person, history with this kind of situation. What are you bringing to the situation?

You are also bringing, I want to point out, a cloud of witnesses with you. Mine, included.

Dr. H. Sherman Oberly, president of Roanoke College, who gave a chance for a college education to what was called in those days an ‘underachiever’ in high school. My big brother, Frank Vest, who gave encouragement to a scared freshman on the first day I walked in the ad building over there. Dean Sutton, who gave a reluctant student a well-deserved kick in the…hmmhmm. Swim team coach Frances Ramser. Coach Ramser.

Unbelievable, who taught me about discipline and courage, convincing me to swim the 200 butterfly, the 200 individual medley and my senior year to even dive. I don’t know how she did it. You know, if you met Coach Ramser, you know was built like a football player. We were all terrified of her. And she had this voice like a Marine drill sergeant.

“Swim, swim, kick, kick, kick!” You know—in that small pool over there—it was quite extraordinary. And I swam the butterfly, so what I heard was, “Blub, blub, blah, blub, blub, blah, blub, blub, blah!” I felt sorry for the breaststrokers, you know, they just heard the whole thing.

Finally, Homer Bast, who became a transformational presence and a life-long friend. Look around you.  These people are now in your cloud of witnesses. In fact, everything, everything that you have ever done, everyone that you ever met, every moment you have ever had has brought you to this place.

My Pop, after four generations of Lutheran ministers, decided to be an alcoholic newspaper man, which was a blessing in disguise that broke the chain and gave me a fighting chance. I wanted my Pop so much to not be an alcoholic, but you know what, if he had stopped drinking when I was nine or ten years old, as happy, as happy as that would have made me, I would probably not be standing here in front of you doing this.

My failure to transform my Pop’s life has driven me to transform every life I can get my hands on.

Everything that happens to you contributes to your being who you are right now.

First question: What confronts me? Second question: What am I bringing? 
Third question: What is running you? I don’t mean what motivates you, how are you like a hamster in the wheel right now? What is it that has you on automatic and you don’t even know it?

Ram Daas, social psychologist, says when we’re born—when you were born—you were automatically enrolled in a ‘somebody training program,’ where everybody around you is training you to become somebody, not just any somebody, but a particular kind of somebody, who had a chance of surviving in the world. By the time you were five or six years old, you figured out what the game was, you figured out who you needed to be and who you were not supposed to be in order to make it through this life. You now have a kind of an operating system that’s on automatic. You’re on autopilot and sometimes don’t realize it. You don’t realize it.

So, first question: What confronts me?  Second question: What am I bringing? Third question: What’s running me?

The fourth question—very, very important:  What is calling you? What is calling you from inside? What are those bone-deep gifts? What are you really good at? My son, David Scherer, who’s here, taught me this question. What are you really good at that you never learned? Never read a book about it. Never went to a seminar. Never were taught how to do it. You‘ve just been good at it ever since you can remember. What are those things inside of you that must be expressed into whatever work you have, into whatever life you have? What’s calling you from inside, and, secondly, what’s calling you from outside?

What’s the difference that you want to make in the world? What is the problem or the situation in the world that you are a unique response to?

Frederick Buechner has a great quote here: “Vocation is what happens where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”

Last question: What will unleash me?  How many times have you had a brilliant insight—oh, I think I’ll do this, I think I’ll go this way? And then you don’t do it. St. Paul was right, “The good we would, we don’t do, and that which we would not do, that’s what we do.” He knew about that.

What will unleash me? Which, by the way, is a root meaning of the Biblical word for salvation. I’ll bet you didn’t know that. Salvation’s not about doctrine or dogma, it’s about space. It’s about the freedom of movement. It’s a little word that means having elbow room, having the ability to expand and express into all directions. Like many of you are feeling right now.

I want to tell you a quick story, a true story. Some of my stories are not true, as my family members can tell you. But this one actually happened this way.

I was in the Navy. I was sitting where you are. I was heading off for U.S. Navy Officer Candidate School. Homer Bast again, big Navy captain, aimed me in that direction. And I was a stutterer. At Roanoke College, I was a stutterer. From the time I was ten years old,

I stuttered so badly it was very difficult for me. A stutterer never starts a sentence without worrying about stuttering. So even though I created little tricks about how to get through a sentence without stuttering, every time I got through a sentence, it was like, “Whew, wow. I fooled them again. I made it through one more time without stuttering.”
Every stutterer has certain sounds that are difficult. Mine were the “ka,” “pa,” “da,” “ta”—the labial dentals, the attacking sounds. So, the hardest class for me was Dr. Gathercole’s French class because everybody was reading the same material; we were all reading in the book. In history and philosophy, I could make up sentences, it was not a problem. But when I had to read what everybody else was looking at, it was terrifying to me, because I had to say the word that was on that page.

So the Navy, in their infinite wisdom, made me an air controller. God has a sense of humor. Let’s see what He does with this one. One day, I was on a destroyer, out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I’m on duty, in combat, and the radio comes on and this voice as deep as God says—oh, by the way, I got on my ship, and my first question was, “What’s our call sign?” They said ‘Hermit,’ and I said, “Thank you, thank you, God!” because I could say the word ‘Hermit,’ no problem.

Then we got assigned to the USS Enterprise. And her call sign was ‘Climax.’ Oh my goodness, you couldn’t have figured a harder word for me, so I would do, “Hmmhmmhmmm, Climax, this is Hermit. Over. Hmmhmmhmm, Climax, this is…” I had to do these tricks again.

One night I was in CIC. This voice comes over the radio and says, “Hermit, this is Climax himself. Over.” This is the captain of the USS Enterprise, the biggest war ship on the planet. He has four of these and a whole rack of ribbons. I have one of these and a name tag. And he says, “Hermit, we just lost a Foxtrot Four, F-4 phantom jet, out your way. I hereby designate you search and rescue coordinator. Go find our boys, Hermit. Two men in the water out there.”

I call the bridge. Captain comes down. The XO comes into CIC. And the captain says, “Mr. Scherer, can you do this?” Now, there’s only one right answer to that question. You don’t say, “I’m a stutterer, I can’t do this.” Not in the Navy, you don’t. I said, “Yes, sir. No problem.” My heart’s pounding in my chest.

So Enterprise starts launching all of her planes. Coming to find these two guys in the water. And I’m there on the radio. And here they come, “Hermit this is Climax 2-3. I got 2-5 and 2-6. Request instructions. Over.” And, “Hermit, this is Climax 5-0. I got 6-1 and 6-5. Request instructions. Over.” And suddenly, I have 10, 15 airplanes on my radar scope all wanting instructions for me to go find these two guys in the water. And I have to keep talking.

After several hours on the scope, for the first time in my life, I had this lightning insight and awareness that, for the first time in my memory, not only was I not stuttering, but—what do you imagine?—hadn’t even thought about stuttering. Why? Because there’s two guys in the water out there, John Scherer, and if you don’t get your act together, they are going to die. Something about those two guys in the water called me out of myself. Called me into a bigger, higher, broader, deeper John Scherer.

We found—the guy in the back seat didn’t make it out—but we found the pilot eventually. We went over there to render assistance. The helicopter’s hovering about as far away as the chapel over there—the old chapel. And the pilot’s coming out of the water and the captain said he wants to know who the air controller was, so I salute him like this. He was a lieutenant commander—he’s about six feet out of the water. He looks right at me and salutes me back. I go around to the port side—there’s nobody over there—and I just began to weep with joy. And I thought: I want to be that young man—whoever that was—on that radio. I want to be him.

That’s what it means to be unleashed. When you get over yourself in service to something greater than who you are. You were trained as I was trained that life works like this: Do whatever you have to do. This is what you’re going to face when you get into the workplace, OK? Here’s the game. I call it the ‘default deferred life plan.’ Do whatever you have to do. Sacrifice your health, your mental health, your family, your—whatever you have—do whatever you have to do in order to have stuff. And as soon as you have enough stuff, then you get to be—whatever—happy, fulfilled, at peace.

There’s only one tiny flaw in that program. It doesn’t work. Because you never have enough to be at peace. So I’m going to propose something that will radical flip it here.

Start with who you are. Let what you do be an expression of who you are. And then you’ll get whatever you get from the world. But that’s just feedback. Who cares?

I came in the house one day when my younger son Asa was playing the piano.

Extraordinary piano player. Playing this Rachmaninoff piece. And I stood at—we had this little small house, big grand piano, took up the whole living room. And I stood in the back door. Couldn’t see Asa, he was on the other side of the wall. But the whole house was, like, reverberating like this, just reverberating. And I realized as I stood there, that the house was not reverberating with the piano. The house was not reverberating with Rachmaninoff. The house was reverberating with Asa. Asa was filling the house. That piano just sits there. Rachmaninoff is just little dots on a piece of paper until he puts his hands on that keyboard and then the music happens.

You’re going to work somewhere. Your name’s going to be in an organization chart somewhere. That’s just your piano. The music happens when you put your name inside that box. It’ll be different if anybody else puts their name in that box.

My daughter Emma’s been dancing since she was born. She doesn’t dance to impress you. She wouldn’t be dancing to get feedback. She’s dancing because she’s Emma. Emma dances.

My son David, who’s here, is a hip-hop rapper. He says, “Dad, I am a white, Lutheran, bilingual rapper. I have no competition whatsoever.”

We were talking last night, and I said, “You’re 32 years old—33. How long are you going to be doing this?”

He said, “Well, I can’t imagine being a 50-year-old rapper. But you know what? I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing right now as long as it’s right for me.”

And here’s why—I’m going to go back to my roots now, the creation story in the books of Genesis. I’m going to paraphrase from the Hebrew. One place it says—now, by the way, when indigenous people, storytellers, tell stories, they always start by saying, “Now, I don’t know if it happened this way, but the story is true.”

I’m almost positive it didn’t happen this way, but the story is very, very true. One place it says, “The Lord created the oceans and looked and saw that it was—” what? “Saw that it was good.” Got some Lutherans here. Saw that it was good. That is a terrible translation of that word! The word is ‘tov,’ T-O-V. “Looked and saw that it was tov.” You know, ‘mazel tov’ comes from that. And I tell people I’m from the South, so I call it ‘tove,’ OK?

Here’s a better translation: “The Lord created the oceans and then looked and said, ‘Yes! Yes! That’s what I’m talking about! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, man! That’s a piece of Me out there in the world where you can see it. You want to learn something about Me, look at My ocean.’” That’s tov.

What’s tov in your life?  What are those moments when your soul, the essence of who you are, gets expressed into the world?

That is what it means to be unleashed. So don’t change yourself. Come home to yourself. Face your tigers. Notice what you’re bringing. Shift from automatic to authentic living.

Find and follow what calls you, a purpose worthy of who you are. And allow life to teach and unleash you. Go for tov, go for tov, every single moment, every day, when you don’t know what to do, go for tov, go for what would be a full and complete expression of the highest and the best of who you are, your soul.

Now, I’d like to invite you to take the hand of someone next to you, please, if you would.

Take the hand—all the way in the back—take the hand of someone next to you. Take the hand of someone who’s in your cloud of witnesses now. And let’s let our voices resound throughout this beautiful Shenandoah Valley. On three, I’d like us all to say, in one voice,

“Thank you, Roanoke!” You ready? One, two, three.[Audience] “Thank you, Roanoke!”

Oh, and about that ladder—just keep checking to make sure that it’s leaned against the tov wall. If you have 50 years left, or 50 days left, or even 50 minutes left, it’s never too late to become what you might have been. Go for tov.

So, one more time, different word. Let’s let our voices return the century and a half of life-transforming energy to these hallowed halls. I thought about these trees sitting up here and everything that they’ve seen. Through every life here today, let this next sound ripple out and enhance the beauty of creation.

Make it your intention; make it your commitment; maybe even a prayer, to go for tov. On three, let’s just ring this valley with, “Go for tov!” You ready? One, two, three.

“Go for tov!”

Thank you.

The season is now upon us. At just about this time of year, year after year, something momentous happens on American college campuses. Something, in fact, a little frightening.

A vast army of know-it-alls spreads itself across the land. Armed with aphorisms and wielding sage advice, weighted down with life experience and heavy-laden with instructive homilies, these creatures parachute, one after another, into various graduation ceremonies far and wide. I ask you to envision that scene in “The Wizard of Oz” when the sky is filled with hideous flying monkeys. They blot out the sun as they flap their way to earth in menacing multitudes. The members of this intimidating group go by a familiar name: Commencement speakers.

In all seriousness, though, this is a great honor and privilege. I am so very pleased to be able to share this day with you, a day of such magic and joy, when we gather to celebrate the life of the mind and the continuing evolution of the spirit.

I would like to spend just a few minutes here today telling you about some of the ideas and values that have shaped my thinking, and my choices. Furthermore, I will tell you why I am, at present, deeply troubled by aspects of the contemporary world. And then I will tell you why that very unease, that very disenchantment, is something that I believe we must welcome and cherish.

And finally, I will offer the thing most dreaded when it emanates from a commencement speaker: Life advice. Yes, it’s waiting in the wings: The world according to me. I cannot promise that that portion of today’s address will be entirely painless—but I can promise that it will be brief.

One of my favorite books is a novel by Willa Cather called “The Song of the Lark.” A young girl leaves her small home town in the Midwest and heads for Chicago, with dreams of becoming an opera singer.

An adult who knows of her ambitions asks one of her teachers: “What will become of her?” And the teacher replies, “I don’t know. That will depend upon the kind of ideas she lives with.”

The kind of ideas she lives with. Think of it. Not what happens to her, not love affairs or good career breaks, but what she thinks about. It’s really an extraordinary notion, and it is so exquisitely relevant to all of you here today. You are going forth into the world with a diploma, with a host of wonderful memories of your time on this lovely campus— and with ideas. The ones you have chosen to take with you on your journey. Those ideas are your compass. Your GPS navigational system. Your Mapquest instructions.

A friend once pointed out to me that I was, in effect, raised by a library. When I think about the turning points in my life, I think not so much about the things that happened to me, not so much about events, or even about the people I have known, as I do about ideas that made themselves known to me through reading books. Books were my Lewis and Clark. They explored the world on my behalf, going out

ahead of me and blazing the trail, just as Merriweather Lewis and William Clark set out for the West at the behest of Thomas Jefferson.

I read books to find out what was out there. And in the end, of course, they helped me discover as well what was in here—in my own heart and mind. I sometimes think that that is truly what education gives us. Of course it gives us facts. Of course it gives us formulas. But it also gives us a mirror. A way of looking at ourselves as individuals, as souls unique in the history of humankind, of and seeing how we fit—or don’t fit—the times in which we live. Education is about absorbing what others have learned and created and believe, but it is also about our responses to those concepts and those convictions.

If I ask you to define photosynthesis or the Marshall Plan, if I ask you to explain quantum mechanics, I don’t want you to give me a string of facts. Facts are critical, but they are not everything; they are necessary but not sufficient. I would like you to describe how quantum mechanics has utterly upended everything we thought we knew about the universe, because it means—quite literally—that anything is possible. Indeed, everything is possible. All at once. What I hope your education has prepared you for is a passionate and ongoing engagement with facts, a way of transforming what you know into what you do.

When you read a book, there are always two sides to that story: There is the book, but there is also you. You’re reading it. Not someone else. That makes it an event unique in the history of the world—just as you, the reader, are unique. Even if the information in that book has been known for many years, it wasn’t known toyou—and that makes it a magical moment, the moment when you make the knowledge yours. You bring it home to yourself.

Because of computers, we have greater access to information today, by greater numbers of people regardless of their economic circumstance, than ever before. At our fingertips is virtually the entire wisdom of the world. You need only possess the curiosity to seek it. And a decent modem.

So what is my complaint about the present day? I’ve just said that we live in an extraordinary age, an age when access to knowledge is as free and inviting as a pile of brightly wrapped presents on the kitchen table on the morning of your birthday. Here is my concern. While our blessings are abundant, we have limited ourselves. We have narrowed definitions and pinched back horizons.

I am most troubled, I suppose, about our increasingly small and unimaginative definition of the word “service.” You are about to graduate from a university that recognizes the obligations incumbent upon each individual to serve, to make the world a better place. But often, the word seems to be restricted to a small number of career choices.

Yes, “service” can mean working for a non-profit organization – or it can mean, earning your MBA and working for a corporation that treats its employees with fairness and respect. A corporation that makes things, or that markets what other people make. A corporation that engages in research and development of new products.

There are many ways to be a community organizer. You can organize and improve your community by starting a new business. By giving people jobs: the chance to earn a good living for themselves and their families. I am disappointed, these days, that we think of “community organization” only as a political strategy. Only as a means of listing grievances. Only as an echo chamber of complaint.

But an entrepreneur is a community organizer. A business leader is a community organizer. Someone who volunteers to help in a school is a community organizer. Anyone in any neighborhood who cares, and who acts, is a community organizer.

These are difficult times, to be sure. You have all read the stories about the lack of jobs for outstanding graduates such as the very people in this room. You have read about the global financial crisis. We all know that there may be very hard times ahead.

But perhaps that’s not such a terrible thing. I recently read a new biography of Winston Churchill by British historian Max Hastings. In “Winston’s War,” the author notes how very much Churchill relished the challenges brought on by World War II. Oh, of course he grieved and he mourned, and he didn’t know if he was presiding over the end of the British Empire. Remember that the defeat of Nazi Germany was by no means a sure thing. Germany was the favorite. The fact that the good guys won was an upset, an anomaly. But in the midst of that mighty struggle, no one knew how it was going to turn out.

Yet here is what Churchill told his countrymen in April of 1933: “Indeed, the very problems and dangers that encompass us and our country ought to make . . . men and women of this generation glad to be here at such a time. We ought to rejoice at the responsibilities with which destiny has honoured us, and be proud that we are guardians of our country in an age when her life is at stake.” That is really a thrilling concept: Being grateful for problems and challenges. Not minding that so many questions are hovering about on all sides, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. Feeling flattered at being chosen to bear such a fearsome burden. Listen, if you will, to this poem by Mary Oliver. It is about living with what you don’t know. With what you may never know: It is possible, I suppose, that sometime We will learn everything

There is to learn: What the world is, for example, And what it means. I think this as I am crossing From one field to another, in the summer, and the Mockingbird is mocking me, as one who either Knows enough already or knows enough to be Perfectly content not knowing. Song being born Of quest he knows this: he must turn silent Were he suddenly assaulted with answers. Instead Oh hear his wild, caustic, tender warbling ceaselessly Unanswered. At my feet the white-petalled daisies display The small suns of their centerpiece, their—if you don’t Mind my saying so—their hearts. Of course I could be wrong, perhaps their hearts are pale and Narrow and hidden in the roots. What do I know. But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given, To see what is plain; what the sun Lights up willingly, for example—I think this As I reach down, not to pick but merely to touch— The suitability of the field for the daisies, and the Daisies for the field. And now for a few of those tips—that Life Advice—about which I warned you at the outset.

Beware of anyone who spends a great deal of time advising you that money is not worth attaining, that poverty is more noble than wealth. This sounds like wisdom, because renouncing wealth always sounds holy, but it is misguided.

Money is not inherently good or inherently evil. It is what one does with money that makes the difference. Andrew Carnegie used the fortune made in his steel mills to build libraries in small towns across America. Bill Gates is providing medical care to children in some of the poorest parts of the world. Had they not accumulated wealth and managed it well, they would not be able to do these good works. Universities exist, in large part, because people with wealth decide to contribute.

Remember that “service” has an endless number of definitions. It does not just mean working for a non-profit. It may mean military service. It may mean a religious vocation. It may mean starting a business that provides jobs for many families, jobs that deliver dignity as well as a paycheck. It may mean creating or inventing. It may mean working with your hands. It may be building houses. Or cleaning them. It may mean fulfilling a managerial role with fairness and vigor—and encouraging others to fulfill their potential. It may mean coaching a sports team or raising a family. Anything you choose to do that involves a vision – an idea about how you want the world to be – is community service. Community organization.

Recently, I found myself reading Evelyn Waugh’s 1959 biography of Ronald Knox, Catholic priest and mystery writer. Early in the book, Waugh offers a short history of one of Knox’s grandfathers, a missionary who endured many hardships, many trials. There was a six-word sentence used to describe this man that completely captivated me. I thought then, and I think now, that is the best epitaph I ever read: All his life his spirit grew.

That is what I wish for you. It is more than a wish, actually: It is a challenge. I challenge you to nurture your spirit by expanding the world’s definition of the word “service.” To always be creating. To always be seeking and finding and then seeking anew. To not blame others for your own mistakes. To make mistakes. Because making mistakes is essential to growth and to progress.

I do not wish you an easy path, because—trust me—you would be oh-so-quickly bored by that. You’d like it today and hate it tomorrow. Instead, I wish you a path filled with impediment and ambiguity and struggle and joy. With plenty of time to be alone, and then plenty of time to be with others, where you take what you learned in your solitude and apply it to the world like a cool hand on a feverish forehead. I hope that your path has as many twists and turns as it does straightaways. I hope that it is as rough and interesting as it is smooth and predictable. I hope that it satisfies you. I also hope that it astonishes you. And I hope that for all your life, your spirit grows. Thank you

Thank you President Karen Lawrence, distinguished guests, faculty, proud parents, and graduating class.

I have to admit I have been in such a panic about speaking with you today for several reasons. The first being that last year’s commencement speaker was Rahm Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff—President Barack Obama’s top advisor. And I, on the other hand, am best known as America’s favorite TV nurse from a show I did back in the '90s.

I was also apprehensive to speak to this class given everything that I have read about your generation lately—and how supposedly "detached" you are from everyone else. I actually had nightmares that all of you would be texting and tweeting during the high points of this address.

I was SO nervous I have been doing quite a bit of reconnaissance. I have read every graduation speech that was ever written, sought advice from the smartest people I know, but mostly I have been listening. Listening to your reflections on the school; listening to your plans post college; and listening to your thoughts for our future. Part of this "listening" was to prepare for this speech and part of it, selfishly, was for my two-year old son—because he has such a big stake in the actions of your generation. I was curious to learn about the people paving the way for him.

I spent some time with a few of your fellow graduates—Hillary, Nora, Zach, Sarah and Rachel. I was so impressed by each of them. I want to thank them for sharing their stories with me. They allowed me to wake up to my college again—which is truly a beautiful thing. And after all my listening, I have concluded, at least here at Sarah Lawrence, our future is looking very bright, and my son, and his generation are in very good hands.

As your commencement speaker, I am supposed to say something like, "you’re all about to enter the real world."  But I hate that adage. It feels so condescending. Didn’t we all enter the real world when we were born? The truth is, your lives really began to take flight four years ago, if not well before.

Sarah Lawrence has given you a foundation and the tools to think for yourself—which is the most important asset you’ll ever have in life. You already have everything you need to make it in this world. If you believe this degree is somehow an end of study or the step across the finish line—You’re missing the point. This education is a gift that you will be unwrapping for the rest of your life.

The graduates I met were all so surprisingly secure, and not with any false bravado—they were pillars of true confidence. There was not one twinge of anxiety in them, and although all of you are set to face a competitive global job market, a tough economy, and a planet rife with political and social unrest. These students didn’t buy into that adage of suddenly entering the real world, and neither should you. You are already living in it. Plus, all of you are at least a little New York savvy, which gives you a leg up.

The only difference between today and tomorrow is that tomorrow, you get to take the lessons you have now learned and bring them to other people and other experiences.

One of the students I met with, Rachel—her father is a professor at the University of St. Louis. He recently asked her, "So, after four years, what have you learned?" Rachel answered with the following: "Dad, I can’t tell you what I have learned because it’s inherent in who I am now."

Her answer perfectly illustrates the difference between our school and other colleges and universities. When I was studying here, I realized I had the capacity to learn everything. I got to write my own papers, express my own thoughts. I didn’t have a textbook thrown at me, and a teacher telling me to "memorize it."  They said, "Question it. Challenge it. Debate it. Think about it."  I was encouraged to explore other passions rather than just find one major.

Like all of you, l had mandatory one-on-one conference work with our professors. So I attended traditional English Lit classes with Bill Shullenberger, where we read the works of T.S. Elliot and Emily Dickenson. But it was in our one-on-one sessions, where I developed my own love affair with authors like Flannery O’Connor—where Professor Schullenberger gave me the assignment to rewrite one of Ms. O’Connor’s short stories from another characters’ point of view. Only at Sarah Lawrence do your professors encourage, and do students have the audacity, to rewrite literary giants. It was one of the most challenging and exceptional assignments I ever had, and stays with me always.

I found my passion for theater on this campus. I was cast in my first play here—it was David Rabe’s In the Boom Boom Room I was a go-go dancer. They gave me three lines, a pair of thigh-high boots, a dancing cage and I was hooked for the rest of my life. On acting, not go-go dancing. It was also here where I was told if I wanted to be an actor I needed to learn about art. And I needed to learn history. Learn science. Learn French. And so much more. And they were absolutely right.There is not a day that goes by that I do not call on my formal education. My film professor, Gilberto Perez, taught me how to dissect a script, a process I still use. My best friends from college are still my best friends today—Alec Holland, Bill Webb, Blair Belcher… Bill flew in from California to be here with me today. The seeds that we planted at Sarah Lawrence have grown into deep roots of friendship. I have been fortunate to meet many influential and famous people—some of whom are my dear friends. But the relationships you make here can be the ties that bind. Don’t ever forget that.

I want all of you graduates to look around at each other. Go ahead. Soak this moment in. Get a good look at your colleagues who’ll forever be linked by the mantra of "learning to think for yourself," and by a one-of-a-kind experience that no one will ever be able to take away. I want you to get a good look at these beautiful people who will support your passions, be your network of contacts, and if need be, catch you when you fall.

You can stop looking at them now. Back to me.

I want to share a personal story—one of those times that tested my Sarah Lawrence foundation and values. I have never really told this story publicly before. And I am sharing it with you solely in the hopes it will inspire you to stay true to your heart—because there is a great value in it.

Shortly after graduation, I got very, very lucky. I landed a role on a show called ER. It was a huge hit all over the world! I soon had money, accolades, status and George Clooney. I started that show when I was 26 years old.

After six years of playing the character of Nurse Carol Hathaway, it was time to go. I missed being away from my home in New York. My contract was up. And while the ER experience was absolutely incredible and changed my life forever—For me, the decision was a no brainer.

My home is here. I wanted to do a play. I wanted to do an independent film. I wanted to experience all four seasons again. And I thought I had earned the right to be able to live my life the way I wanted to. I had already committed to doing a play at Lincoln Center. Everything seemed perfect. I was confident in my decision.

Until they started throwing money at me. So much money, it started clouding my vision. Everyone around me kept saying, "Take the money. It’s only two more years of your life!"

But I said, "I am not happy here anymore. I don’t want to get lazy with the character. I don’t know what else I can do with her. I want people to remember her, not grow tired of her."

The voices of decent continued. "No woman makes this kind of money in this business, unless you’re Julia Roberts."

I was very conflicted. I called my father and I said, "Dad, I don’t know what to do. It’s 27 million dollars."

He gave me the most amazing answer: He said to me: "When’s enough, enough? You’re 32 years old. You own your home. You have money in the bank. When is enough, enough?

I kept hearing my father’s words, knowing he was right, and my gut instinct was right—but everyone else was telling me take the money and be thankful

I am not much of a spiritualist. But I went to this bookstore-- the Bodhi Tree in Los Angeles. I was looking for some kind of divine intervention. Absolutely everyone, except my own family, was telling me I was crazy. I thought this might be a good time to look outside of myself, and the people I knew.

I went to the Buddhist section. Because I thought if any religion was the most fair to both sexes—It’s Buddhism. And girl power is important; I am after all a Sarah Lawrence graduate.

I picked the first book that called out to me. It was called, Awakening the Buddha Within by Lama Surya Das. I bought it. I went home. Went into my bedroom. Closed the door. Opened the book.

This is an absolutely true story. I closed my eyes and put my finger down on a line. I opened my eyes. The line read, "I realized my mission in life was to learn more, not earn more."

There it was, "Learn more, not earn more." I kept hearing the phrase over and over. I then read about the author, who was this big investment banker, hated who he was becoming. He wanted to find himself again. He gave all his material possessions away and found himself in Buddhism. Luckily, all I had to do to find myself was to say no to 27 million dollars and be called a crazy person for years. But I knew I had made the right decision.

So I left ER, and packed up for New York. But I had no idea the backlash I would get for this decision. Frankly I didn’t think it was anyone else’s business. But people said some vile and horrible things about me. One morning I was watching TV at the gym. And some morning talk show was making fun of me, saying that I would be their doorman in ten years, and who did I think I was, after all I was 32, not some spring chicken, (that is a direct quote from a woman I might add). And that my career was over, I was an idiot.

I called my father in tears. "Dad, everyone’s mocking me and saying I am crazy."

And then my father said, "What you did, makes them think—what would they do? By turning that money down, it makes them feel less than, because they never would. The American dream is supposed to be 27 million dollars. And you said, ‘I am happy without it.’".

What I did, whether you agree with it or not, was very Sarah Lawrence—in that I was thinking for myself. I did not act out of fear.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I love making money. I love it. LOVE it. And I don’t want any of the parents here rolling their eyes saying,  "I just spent tens of thousands of dollars on my child’s education and some TV actress is telling them its better to give up millions to do an off-Broadway play?"

No. I am not saying that at all. I hope all of you graduates will have prosperous and thriving careers. But you will more likely find that pot of gold if you follow your passion, are driven to succeed, and open to learning more as you go. Remember the guys who founded Google were passionate about search first – money came later.Which brings me to another Sarah Lawrence graduate I met, Zach—this intelligent, handsome young man is headed to Northeastern to pursue a PhD in Computer Sciences. I asked him what he wanted to do with that degree.

"I want to go back to Sarah Lawrence and teach," he said. First, that is such a testament to how much people love and believe in this school. Second, what a noble pursuit! And thirdly, whether Zach comes back here or not, he is on his path, and is, as my mother says, "Right where he’s supposed be" to achieve his dreams.

As Zach and the rest of you are offered new opportunities, (and fret not, new opportunities will come even in this crappy economy) you will measure them against the goals you have set for yourself today. Often times the distance between the opportunity you have and the goals you’ve set, is the same distance between true fulfillment and settling. Be fearless, but make sure it’s thoughtful and mindful fearlessness.

I have learned to go fully in the face of my dreams. I would recommend you do the same. Now is the time in your life to be selfish. To explore. To take chances. Remember being selfish is not the same as being self-indulgent. You have the gift of time. Use it to do what you love. Believe anything is possible and then work like hell to make it happen. Your generation has every day tools of information that other generations would simply marvel at. Do not, as President Obama says, make them instruments of distraction. Use them to empower your lives and fuel your dreams. In turn, do not be disheartened by the current state of the world. Simply work to better it.

The time in your life when you don’t have obligations and considerations, (like family, bosses and bills) to the time that you do—goes by in the blink of an eye. Use it wisely. Ten years after my decision to leave ER, I had built a life for myself and felt so fulfilled, with a husband and a baby and a grounded life in NYC that I cherished. I was doing Broadway, off-Broadway, a film here and there, building friendships and experiencing a rich and beautiful life and then lightening struck twice—which is a true rarity in my business. When the role of The Good Wife was offered to me, I wanted it very badly. But it was supposed to shoot in Los Angeles or Vancouver. I knew that I couldn’t move my family and uproot my life, so I had to be willing to give up the show, and I told them with a heavy heart that in order to do it, they would have to shoot in NY. If there is a lesson to be learned from that, it is, if you stay true to who you are, you will more likely find happiness. It just may take a little longer sometimes. Ultimately, they were able to bring the production to New York. And ironically, sometimes, we even shoot on this campus.

You are looking at someone who truly feels blessed—I am almost embarrassed by this life of riches that my education has afforded me. The education I received here, gave me the confidence to have the life I always envisioned. We have that in common. This is a smart group of people with lots to offer. I can’t wait to see the next chapter in each of your lives. Spending time on this speech and meeting these students, reminded me of all the promise that emanates from these Tudor buildings. I forever carry that in my heart with great pride. I hope you do too.

Thank you so much. And congratulations Sarah Lawrence Class of 2010.

Here’s to always learning more.

I'm extraordinarily honored to be here today and I want to thank the counseling class of 2010 for this special opportunity. In particular, I'd like to thank Kenya Fernandez and Nancy Bavis for their support in different but important ways for this occasion.


Let me say first that this therapy and counseling field has meant a great deal to me-both as a professional and a client. My first example of this in the professional realm was when I went to college and my psychology adviser very confidently and straightforwardly told me to forget about psychology because I got a D in a statistics class. Do you know what a statement like that can do to a kid who's struggling to find his identity and passion in life--which psychology was to me? Maybe you do--I was crushed. But after much soul-searching and some parental guidance, his statement had the opposite effect. Not only did it end up intensifying my focus on what I love about psychology but some years later, I went back to that same university where the professor worked, as a visiting lecturer! 

This memory reminds me of an old Taoist tale about a Chinese farmer that a good friend of mine, Benjamin Tong, shared with me, and that I recently recited at the First International Existential Psychology Conference in China:

Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away, and all the neighbors came around to commiserate that evening. "So sorry to hear your horse ran away. This is most unfortunate." The farmer said, "Maybe." The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and everybody came back in the evening and said "Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!" And he said "Maybe." The next day his son tried to break one of these horses and ride it but he was thrown, and broke his leg, and they all said, "Oh dear, that's too bad," and he said, "Maybe." The following day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the people came around and said, "Isn't that great!" And he said, "Maybe."

This story illustrates the centrality of staying open to the more of our experience--staying radically open to radical mystery. Take what's going on right here...Do you realize what's going on here? Does anybody really know what's going on? We're not just gathered here on a lovely May day in an ordinary auditorium at SF state. We're all strapped in, seated together on a gigantic ball whirling around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour, nested in a galaxy hurtling through the depths of space and time at 1.3 million miles per hour... 

What if I told you that you are about to embark on a great adventure, that you will be given all the proper equipment for this adventure--food, clothing, shelter. And what if I told you further that you will have about eight decades to complete this adventure, and that every day you will be able to discover something new along your path--new ideas, sensations, and relationships. New people, creatures, and environments. Would you want to go? Would you cherish every moment of the opportunity, and gather up all your strength to participate?  Or would you attempt to skirt, skim, or devalue the adventure? Would you devalue yourself or others along the way? I doubt you would.So why not bring this approach to your home life and career? Why not reconsider the awesomeness of time, of space, and of discovery wherever you are or whomever you're with?  Why not reconsider the humility and wonder, or amazement, of simply being alive?  Or even more to the point, why not bring this approach to your counseling career? What kind of counselor will you be? A counselor who follows textbook formulations and mechanical rules, or a counselor who goes on a journey with her client, who acknowledges the other with her whole body--senses, feelings, intuitions, cultural and political consciousness, and attunement to the living moment you share? 

What kind of social agent will you be? A social adjustment agent who mechanically fixes clients' symptoms and helps them to return to the same jobs or relationships that may have precipitated their crisis to begin with? Or will you be what I call an "awe-advocacy" agent who relates to clients as whole human beings and realizes the preciousness of the moment, the wonder of discovery, and the richness of a bigger picture of life? 

Did you know that it is precisely this latter approach that has been confirmed by the latest research on effective psychotherapy? This research has focused on what leading researcher Bruce Wampold has called "contextual factors"--which are common to all therapies, and which pertain to the atmosphere or context that is co-created between therapist and client. These factors include empathy, alliance, believability, attunement to clients' needs, and hope. Another way I would put these subtle but extremely powerful factors is in terms of presence. Presence is the foundation for awe, and enables empathy, alliance, believability, attunement to clients' needs, and hope (or the bigger picture of life). 

Let me tell you something about the significance of these factors from a very personal standpoint. When I was three years old my seven year old brother died and completely upended my life. I was in very bad shape for awhile, as what was once familiar and routine was now radically askew, and I was rapidly breaking down. But thanks to the wisdom of my parents, I was referred to a psychoanalyst at six years old. Maybe the youngest patient to see an analyst--and I don't remember a thing he said but what I do remember and cherish to this day, was his rock-solid presence.

How many other kids, like me, or adults for that matter, will you help to rescue through your presence, your depth, and your seriousness about the life that is at stake (as my great mentor Rollo May put it) that now sits before you? What attitudes, that is, contextual factors will you bring to your techniques to help them become optimal? Again, it's your presence and ability to attune to people that counts most; the technical proficiency is an added feature of that relational ability. 

All of this is to say that if you want to do this work optimally, substantively, and most rewardingly, you need to live and breathe it in your own life. You need to discover it very personally, either through your own depth therapy or the depth of self-discovery. So put down your cell phones and your neat formulations about jobs or status for a moment and listen to the following bit of folk wisdom (excerpted from a poem by an Indian elder named Oriah, Mountain Dreamer). It's called "The Invitation:"*It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing

It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain

I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it. I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own; if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being human

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. I want to know if you can be faithful and therefore be trustworthy. I want to know if you can see beauty even when it is not pretty everyday, and if you can source your life on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon

It doesn't interest me where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done for the childrenIt doesn't interest me to know who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

In that spirit then, thank you deeply for keeping company with me--and may your new diploma serve as a living diploma, both for yourselves and the culture we serve.

Thank you, President Hill, for inviting me to speak, and thank you to the Class of 2010 for not protesting...seriously. I was wondering what I should say to you — there are so many possibilities you know? So I asked some of you — and by "some" I mean two — who I happened to see in passing. (it was convenient for me). Well I couldn't ask every one of you. It's not like there's some kind of social network wherein I could communicate with such a large number of people at once. That's a joke because there is such a thing — it’s called the Internet.

No, I did actually hear from a little more than two of you that, because I went here, you wanted to know about my experiences after graduating and I understand that because the twenties are that time in your life when (this is not a joke) you're really getting acquainted with your own adult self and seeing how you respond to self doubt when there's so much seemingly at stake. So, let me reassure you. It's not supposed to be easy, but it doesn't have to be torture. You're supposed to have moments of uncertainty about which path to take because the 20's are full of crossroads.

So, back to me. Yes, I sat exactly where you're sitting, exactly 25 years ago. (Pause for disbelief. Thank you!) Well it WAS 25 years ago — I know it’s hard to believe — and Governor Mario Cuomo was our speaker. I had been up all night so I was drifting in and out of consciousness [looks around the crowd] — like that guy. I don't remember much, but I do remember at one point Governor Cuomo told us to look around at our classmates. The idea was to really take in these people we've just had this very meaningful experience with for four important years in our lives. So you can go ahead and do that now if you want to.

Did you do it? I don't know what you all just felt, but when I did it 25 years ago. I didn't feel a thing. Nothing. I thought, yeah, okay, I probably won't remember most of these people and a lot of things that happened over the past four years will fade away and that's all right because that's the way it goes. So I went back to sleep. I know, I 'm a little...cold, I’ve been told. Then I thought, "Oh but, I am going to miss seeing that guy...I see around, Stephen, the Mug manager who dances well. I really won't ever see him again. That’s weird. Well, try to remember him." Now, we weren't close friends he was just a guy I'd run into on campus. As we'd exchange how-are-you’s he'd say, "Oh God, I've got like seven papers? and three tests? all within the next four days?!" and I'd say "Oh God." He'd say, "Yeah." "Okay. Well, bye." "Bye."

I thought it a little odd that the only thing I'd be missing was bumping into cool Stephen the Mug manager who danced well and worked hard. But that was it because I had done what I had set out to do. I had gone to a great school on the east coast, met really interesting and intellectually curious people, made a few good friends, and received a superior education from engaging professors who had high standards. I met those high standards and adopted them as my own and could hopefully carry them into my future.

I wasn't in the mood to look back and be sad over what I might miss later. I was ready to be looking forward...like I'm sure a lot of you are. How many of you are excited to start your brilliant career doing some research in some area of neuro-psycho-pharmacology [and see if you can't ultimately answer questions about how things like neuro transmitters evolved]? Me, too. I was very excited to get home. I had a job lined up with my father who was a headache specialist — yes, I said “headache.” He's retired now, but he was a world-renowned headache specialist who mostly did research. I immediately started to work with him on a study concerning hemispheric dominance and headache types. I won't go into the details, but I could! The important thing was that I was on my way to getting published, then onto a graduate program at whichever very impressive university accepted me. Six months after graduation I dumped that plan and decided to become an actress. Then I was cast on the show Friends and now I'm here, any questions?

How did I go from biology major to actress? That is the one question I'm asked most frequently. Okay, when I was a kid, I did want to be an actress, but when I took biology in high school, I was hooked. The biological theories I learned, to me were the height of creativity. So I pursued my passion for biology and wherever that would lead me. I had nothing to do with acting in high school nor while at Vassar. I was never in a play. I don’t think I ever really saw a play. I wasn't interested in the least, not the least. Then during my senior year at Vassar when I was home for spring break, I was driving around L.A. and heard a promo for a sitcom on the radio. They'd play their best joke from the show and I remember hearing in my head, "Oh, God, that's not funny. They punched the joke too hard, just throw it away, Lisa remember to throw it away when you do it. Why do I need to remember to throw a joke away? I don't need to remember that."

And so I dismissed it...until after I graduated and was happily doing research with my father at the headache clinic and it happened again and again and again. I'd be watching a sitcom and hear myself saying, "Don't do that. Don't do that Komedy Walk thing like these sitcom girls do." It got relentless and I entertained the idea of being an actress, then moved to justify the idea with, "You know, you're 22, you have no mortgage, no husband and kids — no responsibilities. You have to do this acting thing now. Right now. I'm so sorry, but you have to." By November of 1985, I declared that I would pursue acting. My parents and family were thrilled for me and that was the first and most important, wonderful show of support I got. (Look at parents) My parents and family were thrilled, THRILLED. Truly. My Vassar friends were shocked, SHOCKED but supportive and polite. I . . .was terrified, and not because I didn't think it would work out — I was weirdly confident...for no reason at all — but because this didn't exactly feel like it was a choice as much as succumbing to a compulsion, and I didn't analyze what led me to this point, whether it was divine intervention, or a lapse in judgment or sanity, I just listened to that inner voice. By the way, it's always a good move to listen to that inner voice...if it doesn't lead to a crime.

I was also nervous about this career choice because I didn't really care for actors. The only point of reference I had was seeing them on talk shows. They seemed so affected, picking a cause of the month as if it's not about them at all. You know, they’d say, "Please, please save the planet as a favor to me. I'll love you for it, I really will." So I couldn’t and I thought, “How do I hold onto who I am, if I'm trying to become one of them? I don't want to turn into an actress.” Well, that’s a problem, okay, because, as in most pursuits, "one's self” is one of the biggest hurdles to get over. You can't pursue something and be committed to it if you're apologizing for it at every party. Which I did for a while. I learned you have to surrender to the fact that you are one of too many in a highly competitive field where it is difficult to stand out...for now. Over time, through your work, you will demonstrate who you are and what you bring to the field. Just stay with it and keep working. I was collecting tools to cope with this uncertain path in case it got rocky later on, just in case. For now, it's good, though.

I became friends with and stuck close to the most talented person I met at my very first improv class. Conan O'Brien was a nimble improviser and fully committed in every scene, which always made it great. His writing was unparalleled and everyone understood he occupied a whole other level of talent. I hoped I would be influenced by his high standard of writing and performing. Also, I knew he belonged in this profession and I made him laugh, so I belonged too.

I'm on my road to becoming an actress. While I was taking classes at the Groundlings, an improvisation and sketch comedy theater in L.A., I had my first audition and got the part. It was for a backer's audition for an Equity waiver play called Ladies Room. These two minor characters would come in and out and be on stage for a total of maybe seven minutes of the whole play. Here was the audition:

Romy: "Uch, I hate throwing up in public."

Michele: "Oh, me too!"

Ladies Room had a nice long run and Romy and Michele were such audience pleasers, they created a TV show for them, and I was cast in the pilot as Michele. I couldn't believe how fast my success was happening! The pilot, though, was not great and didn't get picked up. I was back to square one and it was the first time I thought, "Oooooo, maybe I'm not a lucky person and this isn't meant to be." Then I recovered with "You know, there might be more ups and downs and you have to weather those storms...and Conan thinks you're funny, so...!"

Over the next eight years, my resolve and commitment was steadily challenged: challenged by casting directors telling me to my face that I was horrible, agents letting me know, "It's hard. We don't know what to do with you. They want gorgeous on TV, you know? There's really not a place for you." Finally, I get a coveted spot in the main company of the Groundlings, and the director there didn’t like my work. "The producers came to the show and they liked your sketches for their TV show. Can you believe it? All the great people they saw and they chose YOU. I just don't get it." Lorne Michaels came to a show to look for new cast members for Saturday Night Live and out of Me, Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney they picked Julia Sweeny. I was devastated. That director told me, "Of course they picked Julia, who else would they have picked?" Naturally, these things knocked me off balance and caused me to wonder if this was the right path for me. Am I going about this the right way? Do I belong here? Maybe I never will be a working actor and I've wasted all this time...then I'd DECIDE, no, they're just wrong (and a little insensitive) but mostly, they are just wrong. And that's ok. They don't see it yet. I'd cling to the knowledge that friends like Conan O'Brien always liked the sketches I wrote and performed. So did Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney, writers I knew and respected liked my work - these people, I decided, were NOT wrong. I DO belong here and Conan is never wrong! (Have I mentioned his name enough? I know him...) That's what I would tell myself to keep those moments of doubt only moments. And it worked, I kept going.

Then, it all changed. I got cast as a series regular on a show that I knew would run forever and be very well written. Jim Burrows was directing and that was a big deal. He'd directed and produced, Cheers, Taxi — everything good. I was set. I was done. No more guest starring roles where you're not really part of the show because you're just there for the week. I was done worrying. “ I get to do what I love on the best show ever.” After two days of rehearsal, I got fired. I got fired from Frasier, the one everyone knew was going to be a hit, and it was. The next day, my biggest source of support had to move to New York to start work on his show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and so my best friend was gone, too. This time, it was really hard not to think that it wasn't meant to be, my career as an actress. It was so embarrassing...Jim Burrows and those producers had to fire me. They were nice, but..."It's just not working and we need to replace you." “Okay...don’t feel bad...” Didn't they know how hard I worked to finally become good at auditioning? That I had gotten over the “being an actress" issue and embraced it? That was hard for me! This was my shot! I cried a lot. Then I got a call from a friend, the actor Richard Kind who I'd met when I had guest starred on an episode of Mad About You starring Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt who said, "I heard what happened. I don't know how you even get up in the morning. How do you get out of bed, get dressed, walk out the door and show your face?" That just made me laugh. That was crazy. I was getting up in the morning and leaving my apartment, so maybe I was coping better than I expected to. The best words were from Robin Schiff who wrote the play Ladies Room and later would write and produce the movie Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. She said, " I know it's hard to believe, but when one door closes, another door always opens. It really does." Yeah, I know, I had heard that very clever saying before. She was right, I didn't believe it, but I never forgot it.

A couple of months later I was almost out of money and my agent called to tell me that Danny Jacobson, the producer of Mad About You, was offering me another small role on the show. The agent was recommending I pass on it because it was too small a role and the character didn't even have a name. It was for the part of Waitress and I wouldn't even see the part until I got to the set in an hour. "Don't take it, they can't treat you like this." I didn't even think twice. Of course, I took it. Whatever it is, I'll make it funny. I'll listen and respond and make it funny. By the second day, Danny Jacobson asked if I would be okay with being written into at least five more shows throughout the season. I told him I was ok with that. Some people thought I was funny as the waitress on Mad About You, one of them was one of their talented writers named Jeffrey Klarik. Jeffrey's boyfriend, David Crane, who recommended I come in to read for his new show about six twenty-somethings who lived in New York and hung out at a coffee house. After many auditions, I was the second person cast in the pilot called Friends Like Us, which would later be changed to Friends. Jim Burrows also directed this pilot and the first ten episodes of Friends. One day the six of us were talking with Jimmy, exchanging The Time I Got Fired Stories and Jimmy told them mine. "Well, she's got the worst one of all, she got fired from Frasier. ‘You weren't right for the part darlin'.'" Thanks! And then he said, "Well, it's a good thing you got fired or you wouldn't have been on this show." He was right. And it was a good thing I didn't get Saturday Night Live and that the Romy and Michele pilot didn't work out and every other disappointment that happened...they were like guide posts that kept me on my path. Oh and after I got fired from Frasier, I went to a birthday party and, feeling like I had nothing at all to lose, I flirted with a guy who was way out of my league. We dated and on Thursday Michel and I will have been married for 15 years. Yeah, that’s the biggest achievement of all, and we’ll be celebrating with our 12 year-old son. Thank God I got fired! Maybe there is a reason for everything. I think there is.

When I was sitting where you are today twenty-five years ago and I thought how I'm not really going to miss Vassar, maybe it's not because I'm made of stone. Maybe its because deep down I knew Vassar would never leave me. My producing partner and one of my best friends is Dan Bucatinsky, Vassar class of '87. I didn't know him while I was here. But when you need to creatively partner with someone who shares your high standards, it turns out to be a Vassar guy.

No, Vassar has stayed with me because I carried those high standards that were nurtured in me here all along the way. I knew what was good and that's what I did and will always try to achieve good work. Even if the network cancels my show, I know it's good work and I'm proud of it. Even if people look at me with pity as they say, "You have a Web series? Awww..." I know it's good work and I'm proud of it. A BBC series that's a historical documentary show on genealogy on NBC? Yes. Really? For American audiences? They won't like that. Yes, they will, because it's good. And they do.

I think there's another reason I wasn't sad to leave Vassar. On some level, maybe I knew I'd be back three times a year at the Board of Trustees meetings. And one last thing...when I was invited to be on the Board, I was very nervous because it was my first meeting, and I didn’t know anyone. Then I saw there was another person from the class of '85 — Attorney, Steve Hankins...who was Stephen the cool mug manager who danced well. It's really nice to see him around again.

I truly wish you all the best in whatever it is that you want. Thank you.

Kim — President Bottomly — very distinguished faculty, trustees, staff, sister alums, loving parents and grandparents and families and all the friends who made all of this possible today, and above all, beautiful, bubbly members of the Royal Purple class of 2010. Congratulations! I’ve even written my speech on purple paper today.

Thank you for inviting me to your party. Thank you for letting me pretend I’m still here. And really, above all, thank you for showing me what the Scream Tunnel sounds like!

I celebrate your accomplishments and I share every tingle of excitement. This day is beyond special in your lives, and I am honored to help welcome you out into the wide, wide world. Regrettably, I do not stand here to guarantee you a job; I can, however, guarantee lunch. Never underestimate lunch.“I also stand here as living, breathing proof that Wellesley does indeed open the doors to the planet. Most of those doors were, in fact, barred to women when I graduated from Wellesley in 1963 — another century, another era, even another color. I was a mellow yellow girl. Golden, if you pushed. Which my generation had to do. As women — or “girls,” they called us — we were not invited to participate in the working world except at the lowest levels. But thanks to the knowledge we gained and the courage we inhaled on this campus, we figured it out. We smashed the barriers so that you — every one of you — can now walk into any doorway that you want. That’s the way it works. Pay it forward, when you’re ready to do the same.

What you have earned as graduates — or about to be graduates — of this amazing institution is the ability to move on, to dare to do anything. What you retain as graduates of this amazing institution is the privilege to return any time. Emotionally, spiritually or just to visit. As dean of religious and spiritual life Victor Kazanjian said, this is home base. Always.

And it’s what you’ve learned in here that will help determine what you do out there. It certainly did for me.“Someone at a Jewish newspaper in Philadelphia, which is my hometown, once asked me if my background had anything to do with my choice of a career, since Jews were always asking questions — and answering with a question. I asked him if he was serious. In fact, I became a reporter for a very corny reason: to tell the truth. To go behind the curtain and expose the wizardry; to find out why and when and where and how; to help make sense and thus bring order to a distinctly disordered world.

By an accident of timing and pure good luck, I have lived the glory years of television network journalism, when news was still recognized as a public service and when getting the story was the only thing that mattered. When we were reality TV. At its best, it’s been energizing and humbling and very satisfying. I relish getting bad guys. I adored bringing people together in front of what we used to call the electronic hearth; I like — what’s not to like — saving lives.

And I loved celebrating the turn of this century on the air with — oh, maybe 10,000 other revelers, Indian revelers, in Mumbai, for our ABC News millennium show, where a very wise fellow helped me put things into perspective. “Aren’t you excited about a new millennium?” I said him, pretty charged up myself. “Well,” he said to me, ” you know, for you folks in America, of course you’re excited; this is your first. We’ve had a few already.”

Perspective.

A few years ago, I did an interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose brilliant mind and true grit helped make women equal in the law. She took me back to 1993, when she first was appointed as the second woman on the bench to the equally liberated Sandra Day O’Connor. So, as Justice Ginsburg told me this story, the day she took her seat, an organization called the National Association of Women Judges had brought along some presents for Ginsburg and O’Connor — and the presents were T-shirts. There was a T-shirt for each of the women. One read, “I’m Sandra, not Ruth;” the other read, “I’m Ruth, not Sandra.” Justice Ginsburg said with great glee, “Now,” she said, “I went through the entire last term, which was my, what? My seventh year on the court? With no one calling me Justice O’Connor. It took six years! But that to me was a sign that we’ve really made it. Now they know that there are two women.” Who would have imagined three?

This wasn’t just about numbers. It was not just about getting in. It was about producing a better product, better reflecting the country, and in my case, covering the news and presenting the audience with a more textured, more accurate sense of the world that we inhabit. And as one of the first women in the business, I not only covered the feminist movement; I was part of it, stepping into jobs that did not exist until I got there, then chronicling the social revolution that has literally changed the rules of society.

Because until women showed up in American newsrooms, and American legislatures, there were no major stories, or laws, on child care, on women’s rights, on sexual harassment. We are the ones who lobbied or reported stories to combat the evils that were savaging our bodies: breast cancer, rape, battering husbands. We are the ones who insisted on putting other successful women on the air, and into every office, so that little girls (and little boys) could know that women in fact can do anything in the world.

Oh, that’s worth a cheer, sure!

I am thrilled that the rules have changed. But I am constantly reminded that the change can be unsettling. How different was it?

Well, I grew up in a world where a mouse was a furry rodent, a twitter was a bird-call, and Katharine Lee Bates, as far as I knew back then, was merely a dormitory. When I was at Wellesley, as Kim mentioned, I majored in classical Greek, which, by the way, I suggest, even if you haven’t majored in Greek, go study it at some point. It will make you a better person, I promise. At any event, I majored in classical Greek, which really hasn’t changed all that much but the collapsed civilization I studied was of Pericles, not Papandreou.

And of course, when I sat where you are sitting, the secretary of state of the United States was — and always had been —a white male. None of whom had gone to Wellesley.

Worse yet, success back then meant defying nature. Anatomy, Dr. Freud told us, was destiny, condemning women to a status far below our own expectations. Little wonder so many tried to act and think like men. We wanted to prove we were just as good as the guys, because they held all the passwords. We worked very hard to detach our bodies from our business lives because we had to. In those days, getting pregnant could get you fired; giggling about girl stuff meant you weren’t serious; crying in the office labeled you unprofessional. Newspapers tapped into the zeitgeist with headlines screaming, “BEAUTIFUL BLONDE MURDERED,” as if the color of her hair had anything to do with the crime that took her life; or, this one’s my favorite, “GRANDMOTHER ELECTED PRIME MINISTER,” as if Golda Meir’s ovaries had qualified her to be the leader of Israel.

Today, men weep in public (often when they’re confessing to betraying their wives), babies have become common campaign props and the U.S. Congress — the United States Congress! — has lactation stations. Being a grandma is not only acceptable, it is partly how the speaker of the House of Representatives defined herself when she ran for the office, later including her grandkids and the children of others — a new badge of honor — when she took the oath of office.

Although I must say, I do wonder why, if it’s so cool to be a grandma in public life, how come no guy running for office ever, ever defines himself as a grandpa?

At any rate, it is now safe, politically, to be female — it is okay if you choose to be a mom, a grandmom, a woman with womanly concerns AND — if you choose – to be a scientist, a corporate executive, a senator, an astronaut, a journalist — all at the same time.

That is the reality on this campus, on this continent.

However, when you step further outside this beautiful quadrangle that we’re in, out into the developing world, the challenges remain very chilling. Way out there:

When times are tough, and prices go up, it’s the girl who is taken out of school.

Way out there, when there’s not enough food, the boy gets fed; the girl does not.

And it’s worse in time of conflict. In modern war, 90% of all casualties are civilians, people not in uniform; 75% of them are women and children.

That’s the bad news. The good news is, that from Wall Street to West Africa, philanthropists and economists have discovered the value of investing in girls and women — notice I said investing, because it turns out that putting your money on girls and women is just good business. The new awareness goes beyond jokes about the possibility of better results if, for example, one firm had been named Lehman Sisters. This is not about women’s lib, this is about women’s lives, which means this also about the survival of children and men throughout the planet. I’ve seen some very heartening signs of progress:

On assignment in Liberia, I met the unbelievably courageous market women who helped end nearly 14 years of civil wars by pulling a trick right out of my ancient Greek texts: until their husbands agreed to sit down for peace talks, the women refused sex. In Nicaragua, I met an American medical team volunteering their services to women who pick and sort coffee beans — they did screening for them and instantly treating cervical cancer. Which in fact is saving lives. And thanks to an organization helping victims of rape in Congo, women-owned businesses are making a profit and allowing their children — many for the first time — to go to school. Here in the U.S., we now have our first ambassador for global women’s issues — reporting directly to the Secretary of State. That would be, our Secretary of State.

You are entering a world that is beginning to understand women’s needs, to respect women’s value and to crave women’s power. At last.

My generation didn’t make all of this possible, and we didn’t do it all perfectly. In the process, we overly dismissed our stay-at-home moms; sometimes I think we may have demanded too little of ourselves. Perhaps we offended or overreached. But we did what we thought we had to, given the odds that we faced. We measured the odds and we saw our goals, and we reached a number of them. Look how the imperative has flipped.

Today, as a sensible friend of mine from California observes, we don’t need strong women to think like men; we need more strong men to think like women.

Not by the way that I think Wellesley ought to produce them; that’s a separate story.

And consider this: my generation is not so easy to get rid of. Some of us are busily redefining retirement, as we adjust to a landscape greatly altered by technology. The challenge for journalism, my business, is immense, trying to cope in a world where news has moved from the living room to your laptop; from a giant studio to a tiny space on your phone or on your dashboard or whatever fits into your hand. I am completely convinced that someday the news will be delivered on our electric toothbrushes. So in a way, you and I are very much alike — as you start out in your lives, and I’m starting out on the rest of mine. We’re both saying, “Now what?” This is not a race; we’re focused on different directions. But I hasten to inform you that while our gender is now generally accepted, our gray hairs are not. Fair warning.

And there’s something else you’re going to find out out there. Something that just doesn’t seem to go away. It’s the question that continues to nag every single working woman in America. And it’s best illustrated by a cartoon that I cite every time I get the chance. It’s a barnyard scene, and there’s a mother hen in front and there are two hens in the back. And the two hens in the back are gossiping about the one in front. And the caption, which is one hen to the other in the back, is, “How she’s able to manage a career and still juggle her family, I’ll never know.”

I know the answer: The eggs get scrambled. Get used to it.

As contemporary women, we have reinvented every stage of our lives, turning dissatisfaction with convention into new rules for success, trying to reshape the battle of the sexes into a more practical form of peaceful coexistence. Once unwelcome in all but the lowest-paid pockets of journalism, my generation of female reporters hit the business when a job could become a profession; when we begged, then demanded, then won, the right to work. We came on the scene as “girls” who were supposed to know our place, which was nowhere. Today, with the privileges we’ve earned as powerful women, we know that our place is everywhere.

I beg you to remember how we and you got here; and how long it took. I urge you not to reject “feminism” as a four-letter word. It is a good, precise term. It means you believe that women are people [interrupted by cheers] — thank you — who have rights and responsibilities equal to those of men. Nothing more, nothing less. And it doesn’t signify warfare. Because men are not the enemy, and we are only part of the solution. We’re all flying on this planet together. And as the multitasking gender, we are definitely smart enough to make compromises when we need to. I certainly did.

As a new wife and unexpected stepmom, I turned political campaigns into social studies lessons for three young boys and I regularly put politicians on hold when the plumber returned my phone call. My priorities have always been very clear. I have also faced the heartbreak of death too soon and come out the other side. My husband died of cancer; I am a cancer survivor.

But I’m betting that every woman here — every person here, in fact — has a similar story, or will, because that, certainly for us, is the story of women’s lives. We dream, we cope and we endure.

And we keep on learning. Today I’m a proud grandma, too, and here is what my grandchildren have taught me: the joy of unconditional love; the unbearably adoring tug of a tiny little hand; the right way to leap off the bridge in Super Mario. I can identify each of The Wiggles by name. And just try me on Hannah Montana.

That is also the story of women’s lives.

As yours begins anew, I have a couple of suggestions: When we’re done here, first thing, thank your families for footing the bill and for understanding that you and Wellesley are worth it.

Remember our history as you make your own.

And while the media world descends into shout-fests and outlandish opinion saturating the blogosphere, please don’t let the widening political divide hijack your dreams or weaken the intellectual rigor that you learned here. There are some people, some very famous people, who are saying some very silly things out there. Things that are just plain wrong. Fight them back. Fight them back with facts. Because facts matter. There are standards of truth, and we should demand nothing less.

Back in 1902, my hero, Susan B. Anthony, the woman who understood the truth that women deserve the right to vote, contemplated the changes after her own extraordinary life. She was 82 — older than even I am — and she was slowing down — which I’m not. But her voice resonates perfectly as you are about to step out of this quad and into the world:

"There is so much yet to be done,” she said. “I see so many things I would like to do and say, but I must leave it for the younger generation. We old fighters have prepared the way, and it is easier than it was 50 years ago when I first got into the harness. The young blood, she said, fresh with enthusiasm, must carry on the work.”

So carry on. Carry us with you. Continue the revolution. Know that we are right beside you.

And just in case you are wondering what direction to take, consider one more thing Miss Anthony said. It was 1905. “I firmly believe,” she predicted, “that some day a woman will be elected president of the United States.” I urge you to go for it. It is our tradition. And it’s about time. Congratulations, class of 2010!

Thank you, all. Thank you, President Spar, Ms. Golden, President Tilghman, Members of the Board of Trustees, distinguished faculty, proud swelling parents and family, and gorgeous class of 2010. If you are all really, really lucky, and if you continue to work super hard, and you remember your thank you notes and everybody’s name; and you follow through on every task that’s asked of you and also somehow anticipate problems before they even arise and you somehow sidestep disaster and score big. If you get great scores on your LSATS, or MSATS, or ERSATS or whatever. And you get into your dream grad school or internship which leads to a super job with a paycheck commensurate with responsibilities of leadership or if you somehow get that documentary on a shoe-string budget and it gets accepted at Sundance and maybe it wins Sundance and then you go on to be nominated for an Oscar and then you win the Oscar. Or if that money-making website that you designed with your friends somehow suddenly attracts investors and advertisers and becomes the go-to site for whatever it is you’re selling, blogging, sharing, or net-casting and success shinning, hoped-for but never really anticipated success comes your way I guarantee you someone you know or love come to you and say, “Will you address the graduates at my college?” And you’ll say “Yeah sure, when is it? May 2010? 2010? Yeah sure, that’s months away and then the nightmare begins. The nightmare we’ve all had and I assure you, you’ll continue to have even after graduation, 40 years after graduation. About a week before the due date, you wake up in the middle of the night, “Huh, I have a paper due and I haven’t done the reading, Oh my god!”

If you have been touched by the success fairy, people think you know why. People think success breeds enlightenment and you are duty bound to spread it around like manure, fertilize those young minds, let them in on the secret, what is it that you know that no one else knows, the self examination begins, one looks inward, one opens an interior door. Cobwebs, black, the lights bulbs burned out, the airless dank refrigerator of an insanely over-scheduled, unexamined life that usually just gets take-out. Where is my writer friend, Anna Quindlen when I need her? On another book tour.

Hello I’m Meryl Streep, and today, Class of 2010 and I am really, I am very honored, and humbled to be asked to pass on tips and inspiration to you for achieving success in this next part of your lives. President Spar, when I consider the other distinguished medal recipients and venerable Board of Trustees, the many accomplished faculty and family members, people who’ve actually done things, produced things, while I have pretended to do things, I can think about 3,800 people who should have been on this list before me and you know since my success has depended wholly on putting things over on people. So I’m not sure parents think I’m that great a role model anyway.

I am however an expert in pretending to be an expert in various areas, so just randomly like everything else in this speech, I am or I was an expert in kissing on stage and on screen. How did I prepare for this? Well most of my preparation took place in my suburban high school or rather behind my suburban high school in New Jersey. One is obliged to do great deal of kissing in my line of work. Air kissing, ass-kissing, kissing up and of course actual kissing, much like hookers, actors have to do it with people we may not like or even know. We may have to do it with friends, which, believe it or not is particularly awkward, for people of my generation, it’s awkward.

My other areas of faux expertise, river rafting, miming the effects of radiation poisoning, knowing which shoes go with which bag, coffee plantation, Turkish, Polish, German, French, Italian, that’s Iowa-Italian from the bridges of Madison county, bit of the Bronx, Aramaic, Yiddish, Irish clog dancing, cooking, singing, riding horses, knitting, playing the violin, and simulating steamy sexual encounters, these are some of the areas in which, I have pretended quite proficiently to be successful, or the other way around. As have many women here, I’m sure.

Women, I feel I can say this authoritatively, especially at Barnard where they can’t hear us, what am I talking about? They professionally can’t hear us. Women are better at acting than men. Why? Because we have to be, if successfully convincing someone bigger than you are of something he doesn’t know is a survival skill, this is how women have survived through the millennia. Pretending is not just play. Pretending is imagined possibility. Pretending or acting is a very valuable life skill and we all do it. All the time, we don’t want to be caught doing it but nevertheless it’s part of the adaptations of our species, we change who we are to fit the exigencies of our time, and not just strategically, or to our own advantage, sometimes sympathetically, without our even knowing it for the betterment of the whole group.

I remember very clearly my own first conscious attempt at acting. I was six placing my mother’s half slip over my head in preparation to play the Virgin Mary in our living room. As I swaddled my Betsy Wetsy doll I felt quieted, holy, actually, and my transfigured face and very changed demeanor captured on super-8 by my dad pulled my little brother Harry to play Joseph and Dana too, a barnyard animal, into the trance. They were actually pulled into this nativity scene by the intensity of my focus. In my usual technique for getting them to do what I want, yelling at them would never ever have achieved and I learned something on that day.

Later when I was nine, I remember taking my mother’s eyebrow pencil and carefully drawing lines all over my face, replicating the wrinkles that I had memorized on the face of my grandmother whom I adored and made my mother take my picture and I look at it now and of course, I look like myself now and my grandmother then. But I do really remember in my bones, how it was possible on that day to feel her age. I stooped, I felt weighted down but cheerful, you know I felt like her.

Empathy is at the heart of the actor’s art. And in high school, another form of acting took hold of me. I wanted to learn how to be appealing. So I studied the character I imagined I wanted to be that of the generically pretty high school girl. I researched her deeply, that is to say shallowly, in Vogue, in Seventeen, and in Mademoiselle Magazines. I tried to imitate her hair, her lipstick, her lashes, the clothes of the lithesome, beautiful and generically appealing high school girls that I saw in those pages. I ate an apple a day, period. I peroxided my hair, ironed it straight. I demanded brand name clothes, my mother shut me down on that one. But I did, I worked harder on this characterization really than anyone I think I’ve ever done since. I worked on my giggle, I lightened it. Because I like it when it went, kind of “ehuh” and the end, “eheeh” “ehaeaahaha” because I thought it sounded child like, and cute. This was all about appealing to boys and at the same time being accepted by the girls, a very tricky negotiation.

Often success in one area precludes succeeding in the other. And along with all my other exterior choices, I worked on my, what actors call, my interior adjustment. I adjusted my natural temperament which tends to be slightly bossy, a little opinionated, loud, a little loud, full of pronouncements and high spirits, and I willfully cultivated softness, agreeableness, a breezy, natural sort of sweetness, even shyness if you will, which was very, very, very effective on the boys. But the girls didn’t buy it. They didn’t like me; they sniffed it out, the acting. And they were probably right, but I was committed, this was absolutely not a cynical exercise, this was a vestigial survival courtship skill I was developing. And I reached a point senior year, when my adjustment felt like me, I had actually convinced myself that I was this person and she, me, pretty, talented, but not stuck-up. You know, a girl who laughed a lot at every stupid thing every boy said and who lowered her eyes at the right moment and deferred, who learned to defer when the boys took over the conversation, I really remember this so clearly and I could tell it was working, I was much less annoying to the guys than I had been, they liked me better and I like that, this was conscious but it was at the same time motivated and fully-felt this was real, real acting.

I got to Vassar which 43 years ago was a single-sex institution, like all the colleges in what they call the Seven Sisters, the female Ivy League and I made some quick but lifelong and challenging friends. And with their help outside of any competition for boys my brain woke up. I got up and I got outside myself and I found myself again. I didn’t have to pretend, I could be goofy, vehement, aggressive, and slovenly and open and funny and tough and my friends let me. I didn’t wash my hair for three weeks once. They accepted me like the Velveteen Rabbit. I became real instead of an imagined stuffed bunny but I stockpiled that character from high school and I breathed life into her again some years later as Linda in the “Deer Hunter.” There is probably not one of you graduates who has ever seen this film but the “Deer Hunter” it won best picture in 1978 Robert De Niro, Chris Walken, not funny at all. And I played Linda, a small town girl in a working class background, a lovely, quiet, hapless girl, who waited for the boy she loved to come back from the war in Vietnam. Often men my age, President Clinton, by the way, when I met him said, “Men my age, mention that character as their favorite of all the women I’ve played.” And I have my own secret understanding of why that is and it confirms every decision I made in high school. This is not to denigrate that girl by the way or the men who are drawn to her in anyway because she’s still part of me and I’m part of her. She wasn’t acting but she was just behaving in a way that cowed girls, submissive girls, beaten up girls with very few ways out have behaved forever and still do in many worlds. Now, in a measure of how much the world has changed the character most men mention as their favorite is, Miranda Priestly.

Now as a measure of how the world has changed. The character most men mention as their favorite. Miranda Priestly. The beleaguered totalitarian at the head of Runway magazine in Devil Wears Prada. To my mind this represents such an optimistic shift. They relate to Miranda. They wanted to date Linda. They felt sorry for Linda but they feel like Miranda. They can relate to her issues, the high standards she sets for herself and others. The thanklessness of the leadership position. The “Nobody understands me” thing. The loneliness. They stand outside one character and they pity her and they kind of fall in love with her but they look through the eyes of this other character. This is a huge deal because as people in the movie business know the absolute hardest thing in the whole world is to persuade a straight male audience to identify with a woman protagonist to feel themselves embodied by her. This more than any other factor explains why we get the movies we get and the paucity of the roles where women drive the film. It’s much easier for the female audience because we were all grown up brought up identifying with male characters from Shakespeare to Salinger. We have less trouble following Hamlet’s dilemma viscerally or Romeo’s or Tybalt or Huck Finn or Peter Pan — I remember holding that sword up to Hook — I felt like him. But it is much much much harder for heterosexual boys to identify with Juliet or Desdemona, Wendy in Peter Pan or Joe in Little Women or the Little Mermaid or Pocohontas. why I don’t know, but it just is. There has always been a resistance to imaginatively assume a persona, if that persona is a she. But things are changing now and it’s in your generation we’re seeing this. Men are adapting... about time...they are adapting consciously and also without consciously and without realizing it for the better of the whole group. They are changing their deepest prejudices to regard as normal the things that their fathers would have found very very difficult and their grandfathers would have abhorred and the door to this emotional shift is empathy. As Jung said, emotion is the chief source of becoming conscious. There can be no transforming of lightness into dark of apathy into movement without emotion. Or as Leonard Cohen says pay attention to the cracks because that’s where the light gets in. You, young women of Barnard have not had to squeeze yourself into the corset of being cute or to muffle your opinions but you haven’t left campus yet. I’m just kidding. What you have had is the privilege of a very specific education. You are people who may able to draw on a completely different perspective to imagine a different possibility than women and men who went to coed schools.

How this difference is going to serve you it’s hard to quantify now, it may take you forty years like it did me to analyze your advantage. But today is about looking forward into a world where so-called women’s issues, human issues of gender inequality lie at the crux of global problems from poverty to the AIDS crisis to the rise in violent fundamentalist juntas, human trafficking and human rights abuses and you’re going to have the opportunity and the obligation, by virtue of your providence, to speed progress in all those areas. And this is a place where the need is very great, the news is too. This is your time and it feels normal to you but really there is no normal. There’s only change, and resistance to it and then more change.

Never before in the history or country have most of the advanced degrees been awarded to women but now they are. Since the dawn of man, it’s hardly more than 100 years since we were even allowed into these buildings except to clean them but soon most of law and medical degrees will probably also go to women. Around the world, poor women now own property who used to be property and according to Economist magazine, for the last two decades, the increase of female employment in the rich world has been the main driving force of growth. Those women have contributed more to global GDP growth than have either new technology or the new giants India or china. Cracks in the ceiling, cracks in the door, cracks in the Court and on the Senate floor.

You know, I gave a speech at Vassar 27 years ago. It was a really big hit. Everyone loved it, really. Tom Brokaw said it was the very best commencement speech he had ever heard and of course I believed this. And it was much easier to construct than this one. It came out pretty easily because back then I knew so much. I was a new mother, I had two academy awards and it was all coming together so nicely. I was smart and I understood boiler plate and what sounded good and because I had been on the squad in high school, earnest full-throated cheerleading was my specialty so that’s what I did but now, I feel like I know about 1/16th of what that young woman knew. Things don’t seem as certain today. Now I’m 60, I have four adult children who are all facing the same challenges you are. I’m more sanguine about all the things that I still don’t know and I’m still curious about.

What I do know about success, fame, celebrity that would fill another speech. How it separates you from your friends, from reality, from proportion. Your own sweet anonymity, a treasure you don’t even know you have until it’s gone. How it makes things tough for your family and whether being famous matters one bit, in the end, in the whole flux of time. I know I was invited here because of that. How famous I am. I how many awards I’ve won and while I am I am overweeningly proud of the work that, believe me, I did not do on my own. I can assure that awards have very little bearing on my own personal happiness. My own sense of well-being and purpose in the world. That comes from studying the world feelingly, with empathy in my work. It comes from staying alert and alive and involved in the lives of the people that I love and the people in the wider world who need my help. No matter what you see me or hear me saying when I’m on your TV holding a statuette spewing, that’s acting.

Being a celebrity has taught me to hide but being an actor has opened my soul.

Being here today has forced me to look around inside there for something useful that I can share with you and I’m really grateful you gave me the chance.

You know you don’t have to be famous. You just have to make your mother and father proud of you and you already have. Bravo to you. Congratulations.

President JehudaReinharz, the Board of Trustees, distinguished fellow colleagues, Consul General NadavTamir, and, especially, to the family and friends and graduates of the Class of 2010. Congratulations!

People—young people especially—seem fascinated with the fact that I served as a paratrooper. “Cool,” they say, “How many times did you jump?” And I disappoint them. “I rarely jumped,” I say. “Most times, there were these two large gentlemen on either side of the door who pushed me out.”

Now, you, too, now stand at the door—outside the darkness is howling, and you’re far from the ground with a chute that you hope will properly open. At such anxious times, it helps to think back and remember the transformative moments in your lives—we all have them—that inspired or motivated you and animated your dreams. A transformative moment, perhaps, brought you to this open door at this moment and you’re about to exit.

For me, that moment was the 1967 Six-Day War; an event that many American Jews thought would culminate in Israel’s destruction but instead concluded with Israeli paratroopers dancing in front of the Western Wall, Judaism’s most sacred site. Watching that scene as a kid in suburban New Jersey, I vowed to myself, “I’m going to be one of those dancing paratroopers someday.” A few years later, while visiting Washington with my Jewish youth group, we were introduced to Israel’s ambassador to the United States. I’ll never forget this. We applauded him until our hands were numb, sang “Shalom Aleichem” until our voices became hoarse. And silently I said to myself: “That—that is what I want to be when I grow up, Israel’s ambassador to America.”

I wasn’t much of an athlete or even a student—I was a letter-man but the three letters were ADD. But it was the Seventies, a time of dreams, a time when an ingenious musician named Paul Simon could imagine himself flying—“I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly,” he sang, “and looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly.”

Right after college, I moved to Israel and I joined its Defense Forces. That’s when I learned that being a paratrooper was not about dancing. Being a paratrooper was about plunging from a plane fast enough, even with an open chute, to break both your legs. Being a paratrooper, I learned, was about having to make split second decisions of profound moral consequence.

Later I went to work for the Israeli government at the beginning of an historic process for peace with the Palestinians. The process precipitated protests and terrorist acts in which many people were killed, including my sister-in-law, Joan, who was a visiting American student at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. My boss at the time was the ambassador who had inspired me as a teenager and who was now Israel’s prime minister. His name was Yitzhak Rabin and for his dream of peace he, too, paid the ultimate price.

Transforming your dreams into reality often incurs a cost, especially when those dreams take shape during times of great challenge. As ambassador, I must grapple with issues that affect millions of lives, including those of my wife and our three children, and frequently I have to face criticism in the media and on campuses. Traveling this great nation, I’m not always greeted with “Shalom Aleichem.” But along with the price there is the inestimable privilege of serving. Whether as a soldier or an ambassador, I’ve had the supreme honor that comes with shouldering responsibilities for one’s people and for the causes of security and peace.

The connection between realizing dreams and accepting the responsibility for them has long been a theme in Jewish history. The Bible tells us of Joseph, the ultimate dreamer, who dreamed his way to position of great responsibilities in Egypt and he used his position for his people’s betterment. But Joseph’s descendants were later enslaved and had to await another dreamer, Moses, to secure their freedom. And even then, those people complained, “We were better off living as slaves than dying in the wilderness.” Moses nevertheless carried out his responsibilities with pride and, at the end of his life, he entrusted Joshua to guide his people to independence. “Hazakv’Ematz,” Moses exhorted his young successor. Be strong. Be courageous.

In modern times, the Jewish people’s vision of liberty in their homeland, then known as Palestine, was galvanized by the Viennese writer Theodore Herzl. “If you will it,” Herzl famously said, “it is no dream.”

Now Herzl was writing during a period of deep despair for the Jews of Europe, confronted with the fiery anti-Semitism fueled by the Dreyfus Trial in France.Yet, rather than yielding to that despondency, Herzl created the Zionist movement that inspired millions of people—Jews and non-Jews—worldwide.

Dreaming during such turbulent times indeed takes courage, but an even greater valor is required once those dreams are fulfilled. Indeed, Herzl’s adage “If you will it, it is no dream” should always be paired with the axiom coined by Herzl’s contemporary, the great Irish poet and nationalist William Butler Yeats. Writing at the time of the great struggle for home rule, “In dreams,” Yeats wrote, “In dreams begin responsibility.”

The dream-responsibility nexus was personified by another contemporary of Herzl and Yeats, that towering figure of 20th century American jurisprudence whose name graces this extraordinary university.

Like Moses, who originally planned on a career in shepherding, and Herzl who only wanted to write plays, Louis Brandeis, too, did not at first see himself as a visionary. But like Moses beholding the burning bush and Herzl witnessing the Dreyfus Trial, Brandeis experienced a transformation. Brandeis was what we used to call a wunderkind. He graduated at the top of his Harvard Law class at age 20—don’t you hate people like that? But he was no hero but rather handled conventional commercial cases. That is until a monopoly tried to take over all of the railroads in the Boston area. The times were also turbulent, with mass exploitation of working women and immigrants, but Brandeis had a vision of America, a nation in which all citizens, irrespective of their social standing, national origins or gender—all of those citizens— enjoyed equal rights and opportunities. He took on the railroad and the gas monopolies, and went on to secure the rights of women to humane work conditions. And he never once took a fee for that.

Brandeis reached for his dreams and, through his dreams; he assumed immense responsibilities on the highest court of this land.But Brandeis also had a dream for his people, the Jews. Like Herzl, Brandeis believed that the Jews should have an independent state in Palestine. Zionism reflected the same dream that Brandeis had for America. “It is democracy that Zionism represents,” he declared. “It is social justice… ” And just as Irish Americans were obligated to support Home Rule for Ireland, so, too, did Brandeis hold that patriotic American Jews were duty-bound to back the Zionist cause.

A dreamer but also a pragmatist, Brandeis focused on building the social and economic institutions of the future Jewish state—laying the foundations on which the citizens of that state could someday bear their sovereign responsibilities.

That vision provided a life-changing example for sixty young Americans, some of them your age, from around the United States—from Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Chicago—who dreamt of moving to Palestine and establishing one of those communal farms, a kibbutz. The year was 1937, the height of the Great Depression, a time hardly conducive to dreams. Worse, Palestine was in the throes of an Arab revolt that claimed thousands of casualties on both sides. Yet, these young Americans bought a plot of land near the Carmel Mountain range. They dreamt and they leapt at the chance to put those dreams into action.

On the fourth of July, no less, before dawn, they climbed a barren hill near a small spring and began to build. “We labor all day,” one of the founders wrote, “running from task to task, our fingers torn by cactus, our bodies covered by flies.” Still, they persevered, in spite of the fatigue and the dangers, and eventually their farm took root. They called it EinHashofet—the Spring of the Judge—and it was named in honor of Louis Brandeis. Their movement’s motto was the same exhortation that Moses gave to Joshua: Hazakv’Ematz. Be courageous. Be strong.

The dreams of Brandeis and the young people of EinHashofet were realized: Israel became a state. But fulfilling that dream meant incurring immense responsibilities. Responsibilities for absorbing hundreds of thousands of refugees from Asia, Africa, and Europe; the responsibilities of sustaining a democracy in a region generally inhospitable to such systems; the responsibilities of defending ourselves while striving to maintain our morality; the responsibilities of balancing tradition with modernity, of preserving our Jewish character while respecting our vibrant Arab minority, members of which serve on our Supreme Court and in our parliament. And we have the responsibility of seeking peace, in spite of the painful setbacks and potentially excruciating sacrifice.

We accept the responsibility of seeking peace and, to that end, we have joined with Palestinians who have for so long dreamed of attaining their own independent state of their own and who are now building the institutional groundwork for that state—in a truly Brandeisian manner.

And yet fulfilling our dream of peace will not absolve either of us, neither Israelis nor Palestinians, of our individual responsibilities but only create collective responsibilities—of healing past wounds and reconciling with one another’s narratives, of forging a shared, flourishing future. That is a future envisioned by Kibbutz EinHashofet, today a thriving community of 800 people which, in addition to agriculture and industry, is home to an Arab-Jewish orchestra that has performed around the world as well as before the Pope. By the way, the kibbutz is also famous for its youth bar, which is called Brandeis.

Now this commencement is not only about Israel, the Palestinians or even a kibbutz inspired by the remarkable Justice Louis Brandeis. This commencement is about you. It is about the challenges that you face in graduating into an uncertain world during turbulent times and still finding the courage to dream. More than that, it is about your willingness to accept the responsibilities you will almost certainly have to shoulder once you’ve realized your dreams.

This is no easy task, and the process may indeed take time. But the very fact that you are receiving a Brandeis degree today—diplomas you’ve earned through four years of dedicated study—show that you indeed have the will to dream and the readiness to accept responsibilities. It may necessitate a measure of bravery and a leap into the howling darkness, but I urge you to pursue your wildest ambitions. Whether it be teaching in an inner-city school, building a clinic in Africa, developing the world’s smallest microchip, or serving as president of the United States, if that is your dream, go for it. Do not let any obstacles, personal, political or economic, impede you. And once you’ve fulfilled your dreams, know that that is when you’re liable to confront the greatest challenges.

But so, too, may you derive the privilege of service. I am honored to share the rostrum today with individuals who have dared to dream and have never recoiled from responsibility. They have paid a price—believe me I’m sure they could tell you, but they’d also tell you of how privileged they feel to be better able to serve. This is the true value of their accomplishments. That too, will be the value of your accomplishments.

Class of 2010, this commencement is indeed about you and, as your commencement speaker, it is my duty—and it is my privilege—to leave you with a few modest words of advice.

Seek your transformative moments and seize them.Dream.Take Responsibility.Take pride.Be courageous. Be strong and though you may just once in a while need the littlest push, jump.

It’s an honor to give the graduation address to the Class of 2010 at Desert Academy.

I am not quite a generation older than you all, about 3/4 of a generation for you math types. In any case, that allows me to speak as somewhat of an insider, at least minimally.

Allow me to be the first to give you the good news: it’s all uphill from here. Well, at least for a while—parents may agree—but there are a few magical years, a bubble of sorts, surrounding 18-22 that give it the highest probability of serving as the best years of your life . . .yes, the cliché you may have already heard too many times.

(But why is it a cliché? Cliches are “trite, stereotyped expressions, sentences or phrases, usually expressing a popular or common thought or idea that have lost originality, ingenuity, and impact by long overuse.” Overuse, my friend. In other words, quite possibly tried and true. The worst thing about clichés, as eyeroll-inducing as they are, is the fact that they are often plainly true.)

When I was in preschool, still new to this country, we sang for the parents at our graduation. Our graduation song was a tune from the decade before our time even, The Carpenters’s saccharine “We’ve Only Just Begun,” complete with the age-inappropriate lyrics and themes and everything. I’ll spare us all the horror of singing it, as a part of me wishes I could do here today, and sort of “rap,” if you will, the main bits: Before the rising sun/ we fly/ So many roads to choose / We start out walking and learn to run /And yes we’ve only just begun!/ Sharing horizons that are new to us /Watching the signs along the way/Talking it over just the two of us/ Working together day to day/Together/And when the evening comes/ We smile/So much of life ahead/ We’ll find a place where there’s room to grow/ And yes we just begun . . . Full of clichés, yes. But if life was all just one big map and this Carpenter’s song was a location—maybe a donut stand?—there would be a red arrow pointing to its heart: YOU ARE HERE NOW.

You are here but where? I’m talking about your continued education, of course, which for many of you means college. How I envy you all, how your parents and teachers do. Yesterday I did not envy you—high school was not my favorite time—but today, with only a summer between you and that world-before-the-real-world, I would do anything to be in your place.

Fact: part of why I teach college is to live vicariously through my students. I would have never left it if they had allowed it. Fact: there are many others among you today and elsewhere that feel this way.

Before we go there though, let’s not pooh-pooh high school too much and look at what was great about it. First of all, I did not go to a prestigious private school like Desert Academy; I went to a big public school in Southern California that was a mess of homecoming games, prom kings and queens, athletes-as-coolest-kids, bottle-blondes-uber-alles, and sometimes a downright mediocre education. I was a nerd, a school-newspaper kid, a drama-club kid, an anti-athlete, a foreigner, an acned one. I dreaded that 8am-to-3:15pm grind, often followed by those mandatory college-kiss-up extracurriculars, rear-ended by hours and hours of homework, and capped off by the ever brief solace from all those requirements: sleep. It was not an era I thrived in.

When it came time to apply to college I chose the farthest one possible, 3,000 miles away, not to get away from my parents—though I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t a perk—but to get away from everything I had known at that point. It was not just geographically far, it was far from everything I knew in every way. I chose the opposite institution: a college smaller than my high school, a private school, an art school, a place with no grades and no exams (yes, such a place exists—sorry, too late!), where alternative culture was the norm. I was more sheltered than many of you at that point—I had never slept in a space without my parents next door, never allowed to go to slumber parties or the like. The first night I slept away from my parents was the first night of my freshman year. Talk about an anti-cliché!

In any case, soon after I arrived, I set about a most meticulous process of inventing myself.

A digression: as many of you know, I’m a creative writer. A writer of fiction. A storyteller whose focus is untruths. I have made up anywhere from 800-2,000 characters, I’d estimate, since I first devoted myself to being a writer at the ripe old age of four. There was nothing more normal to me than making up people, even if I turned the project on myself. So remember the Army recruitment slogan, Be all that you can be? It always seemed like aiming low to me. Just be all that you can be? How was that enough? (I am an immigrant, I should re-highlight here). What about be all that you want to be? That seemed more appealing to me. That involves fiction, of course, in many ways making yourself up, the task I am hoping to remind of you of today.

A proposal: right now and for the limbo of the summer, who you were, who you are, doesn’t count. Sure, cheerleader, activist, soccer-player, ceramics-enthusiast, cauliflower-hater, Twizzlers-fiend, is who you have been. But forget it. Leave it behind. You are about to experience the first taste of freedom in your life and that won’t be freedom from your parents, like most of you are thinking. You are about to be free from yourself, your old self, the self of your youth. You are, in many ways, about to love cauliflower. Think of it like—cliché alert!—the proverbial snake shedding its skin. You have been the opposite of young and spry, like you thought; rather you’ve been weighed down by this thick old inherited skin, getting heavier and heavier as you climbed up these 12 or so rungs called “grades.” By your age, the thing is all callous, an armor of dead weight you can barely move under. But you are about to shed it. In many ways, you are—and forgive the New-Agey-ness of the oncoming sentiment, but, hey, this is Santa Fe!—just about to be born.

But on your terms. You might not even be going to college. You might think you are and suddenly you might not be (the sound you just heard was a collective heart attack of almost every parent in this room) but who knows? When I say your continuing education I don’t just mean college, I mean the L-word:

Life. You are about to get a life, people. You need one. You thought you had one, but, boy, were you wrong. It was life-esque, at best, the test run tutorial before the video game begins. But joysticks ready, folks, you are about to click to begin. This is good news.

When I was young we had a book series called Choose Your Own Adventures. (Are they read much anymore? I’m not sure.) It was my dream to write for them. The thin novels would offer a simple story at first, character, setting, etc and then it would branch off: If you decide to board the space ship, turn to page 6. If you decide to run back and ask your parents, turn to page 7. And then it would branch off further, with multiple ending possibilities (something like 40 in a single book). Well, here you are at the real Choose Your Own Adventure. College—first option: Go; second option: Don’t Go/Drop Out. Go can lead to Pick the Perfect Major, Get Perfect Grades, Graduate With Honors, Go to Grad School, Get Amazing Job, Meet Amazing Partner, Get Married, Have Children, Retire, Die. Let’s try the other option: Don’t Go/ Drop Out: Get Mediocre Job can lead to Die in just another step or two or it can go much the same: Amazing Job, Amazing Partner, Married, Children, Retire, Die route. All the endings are the same in this Choose Your Own Adventure. DIE. Now don’t get depressed—you knew this. You knew it before I knew it certainly, a kid over 10 with no idea that natural causes could kill a person. When my mother told me, by a cemetery of all perfect ambient settings, I asked her, How much longer do I have? She said, Seventy or eighty more years. And I thought, Seven or eight more of my current life span? My god.

You now have between four to five most likely. (I don’t even have three realistically so don’t act too upset.) We are here briefly. And we have no way of knowing how it will turn out. We can go the Good Path or the Bad Path and it all may turn out to be the same. Or not. We won’t ever have known the difference, this is the hidden blessing.

So what do we do? Flip a coin? Kind of. You flip a coin, but with a steady head. You flip a coin, but not in a tornado. So much of life is based on luck, that’s the ugly truth. But there are ways to make yourself luckier. A continued education is one. The Just Say No to Drugs thing was an attempt at another. The reminders to eat and sleep well—all those things you thought were optional that you will suddenly be obsessed with when you reach my age—file under ways to get you chummier with Lady Luck. I tell young writers who often feel frustrated by the seemingly impossible path to publication that much of the battle is being in the right place at the right time, in fortune’s path, poised to get lucky. Naomi Campbell, the belligerent model, was discovered at age 15 at a shopping mall, as the story often goes. If Naomi Campbell was a recluse, she would have considerably cut down her chances of courting luck and getting scouted while scoring an Orange Julius. She also got lucky by taking care of her appearance we may presume—if Naomi Campbell had let herself go to a Where the Wild Things Are state (and let’s be real, folks, we all have it in us)—her odds of capturing the eye of the food-court-creeping model-catcher would have been axed by a sizable percentage. She also got lucky by being in her short-lived nice phase—if she had thrown her cell phone, as she became famous for later, at the dollar-sign-eyed scout who was licking his chops at young teen Naomi, chances are there would have been no Naomi-Campbell-the-Supermodel. She helped the luck along, somehow.

Let’s highbrow this a bit. There’s my favorite Walt Whitman quote, which happened to be my senior quote: “Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks its way.” It’s saying things will happen, but who you are will still remain. I’d add this very non-poetic footnote to it: “So pick yourself wisely, kiddos.” You are here at a red-arrow crossroads. It’s a sugary lucky place, I assure you, one of life’s sweetest spots. Heaven is a green live-in residence that is not rehab or a mental institution, where you will be surrounded suddenly by hundreds of upstanding, earnest, reasonably smart, fairly well-off people who don’t know you—but who are open to knowing you. Be who you want to be. And pick that person wisely. Pick a lucky person.

Is a lucky person pretty, fit, smart, funny, tall, thin, wacky, social? I’m not talking about the obvious attributes most people desire. I’m talking about this: it’s Vegas, you’re playing at the slots, you have to get a row of matching fruit for the big bucks. Nothing means money more than when all your fruit matches, people. Pick a matching personality. Run with whatever indicators you have now—I think I am good at soccer—but be open to new ones—this cauliflower vegetable is not so bad, especially when covered in cheese.

Let me give you some helpful hints. Be different is probably the best I have to offer. Anecdote: when I was a senior in college, suddenly all my nerdy art school friends wanted to have a real spring break experience. They had no doubt seen the MTV Daytona Beach specials, caught the Cabo buzz and Florida fever, and suddenly wanted this. I was torn. The truth was I had no interest in such a thing—I had never worn a bikini in my life and the idea of excessive drinking with strangers from other colleges in an excessively hot climate for a week sounded like punishment more than anything. But I also wanted to do something with my friends, who I considered I might never see again, being a senior. In the end, I opted out of their escapade. Instead I alone embarked on a long bus ride to a region of the world I had never been, the American South, to finish my honors thesis on my literary first love, Faulkner. I spent a week there, crashing with Ole Miss students I had contacted in the early days of email, and eventually I got to meet Jimmy Faulkner, his oldest living relative, his nephew, and was shown all these amazing secret Faulkner spots along the way. It was one of the best times in my life. But flash back in story to when I revealed this to my friends: What are you talking about? Homeworking for Spring Break?! They were appalled. But I knew by then, at the age of 22, that I was different and that was something to run with.

Another thing: be smart. Value this in yourself over everything. In my youth, for money, very briefly I modeled (in an infinitely un-Naomi-Campbell-like way, rest assured), and then nine years later I was in a car accident where a portion of the right side of my face was torn off. I now have a smile that may look okay to you, but it is fairly unrecognizable to me, even five years later. But I did not mourn my face, like my own mother did. I was just relieved that the accident got this close to my brain and missed. By the age of 27, I related only to my brain and nothing else. Having a good hair day was nice, but nothing would come close to having a good brain life. Your brain is tied with your heart for your most valuable attributes, since the jury seems a bit out on the existence of the soul.

What I’m trying to say is what you must know on some level: you are free. This is terrifying, to not just your parents, but if you’re smart, to you too. Restriction is easy; confines create a shelter after all; to be under the jurisdiction of another means to exist in the protection of another’s shell. So far you’ve been a sort of mollusk, in other words, at best. No more will someone wake you up and remind you to go to school. No longer does the law require that you be somewhere five days a week from 8-to-3:15, engaged in a song and dance called “periods.” The word “homeroom” will be obsolete. “Prom” will be a word you will forever be embarrassed about. “SAT” will go back to being an abbreviation for Saturday again.

So embrace your new family whether in the work world or the community of undergraduates you are now about to join: other than cults, there are no other places in the world where physically healthy people get to live and sleep in the same place for years. Embrace the fact that your bad clothes and zits will be second to what you do as the factors that define you—you may have a job, you will find a major, maybe even a minor. For the only time in your life, you will have month-long winter breaks, which if you add to the summer and spring breaks, means you get more vacation time that any other citizens on earth (even kindergartners)—that speaks for itself. And people will suddenly be proud of you for just being—a high school graduate, a college student, owner of your own small business, a human who has made it somewhere, a bona-fide flesh-and-blood adult.

I’ve been teaching these adults between the ages of 18-22 on and off for the last seven years. I always tell them at that age they are the best members of society—the smartest, most able. They are our future, as the cliché coos. Now that’s you. Be okay with that. Be different, be smart, but most of all accept that heavy torch from me and my generation: be the future. It’s a better place than this one—or most importantly, believe that within you is the ability to always make it a better place than this one.

The best of luck to you all in choosing your own adventures, whatever they may be.

Thank you for asking me to be here today. I know by virtue of the achievement that earned you these seats down front today that you are too smart to take advice from anyone who hasn't earned it; let alone an erstwhile Northampton radio show D.J.

However, I do have a story to tell that I admit is a little woolly.

In June of 1900, a self righteous, by all accounts quite unpleasant woman in Kansas had a religious vision. Her name was Carry Nation. And years later when she wrote her autobiography in which she all but named herself a saint, she said that while she was praying in June 1900 and lamenting, weeping, trying to find a way to be a better Christian, she said that God spoke to her in a clear voice and directed her to go destroy saloons. God told her to leave Medicine Lodge, Kansas, and go and Kiowa, Kansas, and destroy any saloons she found there, and she did.

She stormed these turn-of-the-century bars, these saloons with their long mirrors, and she had a big rock and she used the rock to smash bottles of liquor -- she just laid waste to these barrooms.

Turns out Carry Nation had a hankering for this. She lustily enjoyed destroying property and terrifying people.

She soon made both a habit and a career of it. She traveled all over: Kansas first, and ultimately all over the country, destroying barrooms. She first used a rock and then a hatchet. She adopted the hatchet as her symbol. She called her saloon smashings "hatchetations," which is probably the one really cool thing about Carry Nation: "hatchetations."

Carry sold these tiny pewter hatchet pins and fundraising souvenirs. You can buy them on eBay. I have one. It looks like a labrys though. It's a nice idea but different.

Carry Nation's fundraising was actually for herself so she could market herself as essentially a sideshow act, as a “saloon smasher,” and she had a traveling sideshow manager promoting this traveling saloon-smashing road show she did around the country.

As a person who has become not a little obsessed with Carry Nation, I have come to think of her as mostly an American huckster, just promoting herself. But she was also promoting her cause: temperance, outlawing drinking, prohibition. And that campaign worked – she was one of the reigning symbols of the Prohibition movement from when she started smashing saloons in 1900 to when she died in 1911. By 1917, the combined effort of activists like her and the women's temperance union had actually succeeded in passing an anti-booze amendment to the United States Constitution -- as if we didn't have other things to do.

It passed overwhelmingly through both houses of Congress less than a year and a half later, ratified by two-thirds of the states; and, starting in 1920, the incredible stupid idea of Prohibition was the law of the land -- and it was a disaster.

Alcoholism went up. Dozens and then hundreds and thousands of illegal drinking establishments opened up. Bootleggers ran the black market to end all black markets. A whole new variety of organized criminal activity blossomed.

With the massive surge of profits flowing through that criminal underworld, this country reached whole new levels of government corruption that puts anything we've got today to shame -- except for maybe the Interior Department of the Bush administration.

It's not about the Bush administration -- remember they put the Abramoff guy as the Number Two guy in charge of the Department of Interior and there was that one office where they were snorting meth off the toaster oven and the people who worked in the office regulating the oil industry were actually having affairs with oil industry lobbyists? So the Bush administration Interior Department maybe can compete.

And actually, when you think about it, there was that morning last summer when 44 people got arrested all at once in New Jersey on corruption, and then there's Rod Blagojevich -- so alright maybe we can imagine what super corrupt criminal government looks like. But in Prohibition it was really bad.

In the Depression, the criminal economy that was a side effect of the Carry Nations of the world convincing us to ban booze -- that criminal economy was big enough that it crowded out a lot of the real economy. Trying to recover from the Great Depression meant, in part, finding a means of stimulus spending that wouldn't just disappear into the gangster economy, which was quantitatively an actual competitor to the legitimate economy.

Now granted, we do remember some cool things from that era -- flapper dresses, every drink you've ever had with orange juice because they needed something with a strong flavor to disguise the taste of the disgusting bathtub gin -- but basically it was a huge public policy failure.

I'll give you just one more concrete example of how barbaric and stupid this time was in American public policy. Consider industrial alcohol. There's alcohol for drinking and then there's alcohol for solvents -- rubbing alcohol. People were so desperate to drink that they would sometimes drink industrial alcohol, or people in the wildly profitable business of bootlegging would steal or rip off industrial alcohol and then redistill it to make it vaguely drinkable.

The government decided during Prohibition that that must be stopped, and their genius idea to stop it was to poison the industrial alcohol. Deborah Blum wrote about this for Slate.com recently. The government took industrial alcohol and they added things like kerosene, gasoline, benzene, mercury salts, nicotine, ether formaldehyde, acetone. They would add known poisons to these things that they knew people wanted to drink and then people would still drink them and they would die. It's been estimated that as many as 10,000 people may have been killed by government actions in this way during Prohibition when the government decided to discourage people from doing things that people already knew was bad for them but they wanted to do it anyway.

Prohibition was really stupid on a million different levels. Finally after 13 long, dumb years, it was repealed in 1933, and then we as a country promptly set about forgetting we had ever done it.

I think it's important to remember Prohibition because enacting it was a huge disaster for our nation, but it was a personal triumph for Carry Nation.

I would like to offer the hypothesis on this beautiful graduation day that personal triumphs are overrated.

If you think about it, when Jack Abramoff got the White House to install his on- the-take, corrupt, patsy as the Number Two job at the Department of Interior thus leading to the snorting-meth-off-the-toaster-oven, sleeping-with-the-oil-lobbyist vibe at the Department of the Interior, that was a personal triumph for Jack Abramoff.

Someone at Yum Brands this year achieved their personal triumph by getting KFC to remove the bun from a cheese and bacon sandwich and replace that bun with pieces of fried chicken -- the double-down sandwich-designer's personal triumph.

When the current president hit upon the strategy of co-opting his political opponent's wish list in order to get a climate bill passed this year, President Obama, adopting “Drill-Baby-Drill,” was lauded in the Beltway press as a political and personal triumph.

Someone invented the AMC Gremlin and got a car company to build it for nine years -- that was a personal triumph.

There's a Tennessee businessman who has mass-marketed a legal means of charging 400 percent interest on something called "payday loans" despite laws against usury and loan-sharking in this country. He made so much money off of ripping off Americans that way that he built himself a full-scale college football stadium with lights and seating and a field house and everything in his backyard for his personal use, and he hires college football teams to play there for his own enjoyment, he markets himself as a great American personal triumph.

Al Capone rose from humble beginnings in Brooklyn to build a huge crime empire that essentially owned Chicago during Prohibition -- a personal triumph.

All these people dream their dreams and work hard and achieve their dreams.

Some dreams are bad dreams.

Will you do that again? Yah? The hooting -- that's very nice, thank you.

Everybody always says around occasions like this: life is short. It might be. If it is for you, I'm sorry. I wish that was not the case. But I would caution against believing life is short and to live everyday as if it is your last as if you're ever only going to be roughly the age you are now.

Frankly, if all goes well, life is long. So if you might take advice for me I would offer this, hopefully life is long. Do stuff you will enjoy thinking about and telling stories about for many years to come. Do stuff you will want to brag about. No one brags to the grandkids that they were one of the geniuses behind poisoning all the industrial alcohol in the country. Nobody's going to brag to grand kids about "Who-needs-wetlands? Let's-have-a-subdivision-and-a-shipping-canal-instead" decisions that made New Orleans the tragedy and the distant hope that it is today -- and the 40 percent of our nation's wetlands that is Louisiana's beaten, bloodied coast.

Nobody's ultimately going to brag to their kids about having told the country that we ought to invade Iraq because, you know 9/11, and it ought to be easy. Imagine in the family history: "Yeah, then granddad went onto TV and said war in Iraq would take six weeks, max." Nobody wants to remember that about granddad.

So I would advise, if you have the choice, don't be the granddad, don't be the grandma whose temporal personal triumph is something you only hope is something that gets forgotten in history.

In the big picture, standing at the age 22-ish or 40-ish or 62-ish -- Ada Comstockers, right on -- standing at the age you are now at graduation, looking for your own deep-water horizon, consider the possibility that you might very well get old -- everybody hopes you do. Be part of good decisions because the stuff you do now you will want to be bragging about when you become 90.

How do you become part of good decisions in the absence of a crystal ball? The best way to guess what is going to work out in the future and to figure out what you'll be glad you played a role in is to get smart and get smart fast, to take the opportunities you've got very seriously, to continue your education not necessarily in a grad school way, but in a lifelong way, be intellectually and morally rigorous in your own decision-making and expect that the important people in your life do the same if they want to stay important to you.

Gunning not just for personal triumph for yourself, but for durable achievement to be proud of for life is the difference between winning things and leadership; it's the difference between nationalism and patriotism; it's the difference between running for office and devoting yourself to public service; it's agreeing that you're part of something; taking as your baseline that you will not seek to reach your own goals by stepping on your community; it means coming to terms that your country needs you, Smith Class of 2010.

There will come times in life and career ahead when you have to choose between integrity and more short-term temptations. You will be the press secretary who is asked to lie to the press; you will be the regulator asked to approve the drilling with the Mickey Mouse safety plan; you will be the artist commissioned to make what you suspect is propaganda; the engineer pressed to use the cheaper, unsafe welds; the job applicant asked to cross the picket line; the research scientist expected to round to the nearest publishable conclusion; the spouse tempted to cheat; the physician tempted to schill; the staff sergeant asked to keep quiet; the politician confronted with the focus group that proves how well appeals to racism poll in your district; the pundit offered the talking point; the procurement officer offered the kickback.

In the short term it's always crystal clear what advances you further, what makes you famous, what gets you your boss' job, what gets you elected, what gets you rich.

In the end, though, blood will out.

History has a way of not remembering that some of those Iraq War press secretaries had real talent in the White House press room; or that BP and Trans-Ocean had a real talent for drilling down to find oil deeper than anyone else.

When given the choice between fame and glory, take glory. Glory has a way of sneaking up on fame and stealing its lunch money later anyway.

Life might very well be long, keep your eye on the horizon and live in a way that you will be proud of. You will sleep more. You'll be a better partner. You'll be a better mom. You'll be a better friend. You'll be a better boss, and you will not have to remember any complicated lies to brag about at the old age home because you can brag about the truth of your well-lived life.

In conclusion, I'm not going to be egotistical enough to ask you to remember any of this advice. I might ask you, though, to remember Carry Nation. Carry Nation got what she wanted against the odds -- a product of her hard work -- it's not meant to be inspiring. It's meant to worry you. You are graduating from Smith College. You are well prepared. You are poised. You're well connected. You are wicked smart. You are already accomplished.

Do not for yourself today, but for yourself to be proud of at the end of your life. Do not for the fame, but for the glory – learn the difference. Do not just for your own life, but for the life of your nation, that is still, for all its challenges and its flaws, is in many ways the best hope on earth. A country that needs you and the best you have to offer and your best judgment.

Thank you for asking me to be here. Thank you for already having done the hard work that got you here, and please enjoy this moment. Be proud of yourself. We're all so very, very proud of you.

It is my great pleasure and honor to be among the first to congratulate you on completing your studies at the University of Arizona, the flagship institution of our state, and — I can say with utmost confidence — the university with the most Facebook fans in the state.

Congratulations as well to those family members and friends who have supported and encouraged our students through the process. Graduates, I applaud you for showing up day after day, semester after semester, for opening your hearts and minds to multiple ways of seeing, representing, and analyzing the world. For some of you, a Bachelor’s degree has turned out to be not enough schooling and so you are headed off to graduate school, medical school and law school. A handful of you are here today because you have finally reached the terrific milestone of completing a doctorate. But most of you are here to celebrate the momentous conclusion of your undergraduate studies.

If you entered college immediately after finishing high school, you have been a student for at least the last 17 consecutive years. 17 years. Now you will try your hand at making a life outside of the context of classes, teachers, required reading, libraries, flip-flops, office hours, deadlines, and all-nighters. That you are about to undergo a major and exciting life transition may not have fully sunk in yet. I’m guessing that you have been too busy attending to the details and whirlwind of the end of your last semester: your examinations and essay writing, your celebrating and packing. But in the upcoming months you are likely to experience a range of emotions from euphoria over what you might perceive as newfound freedom to a great sense of loss as you realize that college life simply cannot be replicated.

When finding yourself nostalgic for this stage of your life, can you remember that though you are no longer a student, you are taking your college experiences with you everywhere you go. Whichever route you take from here, it is absolutely essential that you honor and not take for granted your diplomas. Too many people in this country will never in their lifetime have the “privilege” to set foot on a research-one campus, much less hang a framed diploma on their wall. You may not have always appreciated those five-page essay assignments in which you were required to analyze and interpret a social problem or a poem or a political speech. But I hope that among the dozen or so of those essays you wrote for us, the process of brainstorming, outlining, discussing, writing, and revising at least one or two essays made you feel alive, interested, engaged, heard, smart, and maybe even brilliant. Now that you won’t be receiving grades and regular feedback from professors, it is crucial that you own your knowledge, that you deeply believe in yourselves as thinkers, and that you continue to hone your critical skills by being avid and sharp readers, by discussing social issues with your friends, co-workers, and family. The United Negro College Fund created a spot-on slogan when 40 years ago they said simply “A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste.”

Take your powers of reasoning, evaluating, analyzing, arguing, critiquing everywhere:
from the grocery store to the voting booth; from the next episode of reality TV you watch to the controversial state bills you read; from the way you handle a painful situation in which you suspect you are being treated unfairly, to the way you respond to a situation in which you bear witness to someone else (possibly even a stranger) being treated unfairly … whether because of the color of her skin, the accent he might have, or her country of origin.

One of my favorite classroom experiences is when a student raises her hand to say, “Professor Soto, this discussion reminds me of a book we are reading in one of my other classes.” In that unique moment, this student is not only fully invested in and driving knowledge production but she wants to share her insights with me and her fellow students, asking us to consider an issue or a problem through a fresh angle, one enabled by innovative and interdisciplinary thinking.

We are counting on you to continue to make and share those inventive connections between issues that might seem separate from one another. In fact, we are dependent on you — the next generation of leaders, teachers, journalists, and lawyers — you will have to confront and solve such a difficult and challenging set of problems. I know that it will sound cliché canadianpharmacyonline-rx.com for a convocation speaker to state that this particular group of graduates — the class of fill-in-the-blank — is at a crossroads. However, if the recent past has been any indication of what is to come, you — the CLASS of 2010 — will need to muster all of the tools of your education in order to negotiate and help solve a range of social problems and vexing issues that those who came before you have not managed to disentangle, from immigration reform to our ongoing war, through the economic recession. We have only to turn on the TV to see one of the wealthiest and most technologically sophisticated corporations in the world unable to stop an oil leak threatening natural and human devastation.

Who would have thought that an environmental disaster of that magnitude would be competing for national headline space with … Arizona?The whole nation is watching Arizona right now.

We went so quickly from a fairly typical state situation in which we were concentrating our efforts on how best to dig ourselves out of this economic hole we have been canadian pharmacy in for the last several years without compromising our public services and our public education to a crisis situation in which our public policy and social relations are incredibly tadalafil online strained, in which racial discord is being provoked not solved by the recent legislation that is horrifying so many of us in and outside of Arizona. Certainly, we will not all agree on how best to reform immigration. But it is our civic responsibility to have educated, well-informed, and non-hysterical debate, and to develop solutions that are fundamentally respectful of human and civil rights.

What we so desperately need — and yes this does put the class of 2010 at a particular crossroads — is for you to bring every critical thinking skill at your disposal, and then some more, to bring all of the substantive knowledge of history, diverse cultures and societies, ethics and politics — bring all of these to the table.

The new Arizona law generally known as SB 1070 is considered the strictest anti-immigrant legislation in the country and is explicitly intended to drive undocumented immigrants out of the state. One reason it has instigated a boycott is because to a whole lot of people, myself included, it appears to not only invite but require the police to engage in racial profiling. Before we had a chance to fully get our heads around the implications of either 1070 or of the subsequent boycott, our governor signed HB 2281, which is intended to eliminate any Ethnic Studies classes from public and charter schools in Arizona.

As I held hands with Middle and High School students who formed a human chain around TUSD headquarters this past Wednesday to protest this law, the children tirelessly chanted:
“Our education is under attack, what do we do? Fight Back.”As a professor, someone who has committed her life to teaching, I was moved beyond words to see those children peacefully — in fact, beautifully — asking only for a chance to see themselves reflected in the lessons they are taught, the lectures that they hear, the textbooks that they read.I was there with those children for two reasons:

First, Chicano studies, the field under attack in this legislation, is my own field of research and teaching. The law suggests that it is knowledge about marginalized histories and cultures that will divide us. That is, this law tries to shoot the messenger. As the young students told reporters repeatedly Wednesday, they have a right to learn about all sorts of diverse histories and cultural expressions. The second reason I stood with those children is because their education, like your education, matters to me. If I have been saying anything to you so far, it is that education has a public value. That is, your education will not only bring you a bigger paycheck. It will enable you to be a better fellow citizen, more productive, better able to participate in solving the challenges I and my peers have not been able to conquer. So the ongoing cutbacks in public funding of education, as well as the recent devastating cuts to our own university among others, are deeply worrying to me in that they strike at both the quantity and quality of education that this state provides to its people. I do hope that you will, like the youth I stood 

I am so happy to add my voice to my daughter's and tell you what an honor it is to be at Scripps College and to offer a commencement address, along with her. About all a commencement speaker can really do is to suggest a couple of things that she believes really matters. And Ann has offered this idea, along with your senior speaker, I think. It was a very similar idea, in fact. That it is important, that it matters, to listen to what is inside of yourself and discover your necessary fire, and that, in fact, this may be the way your particular genius is found.What I'd like to add to that is that your necessary fire is not only necessary for you, it is necessary to the world itself. Years ago, I came upon a memorable line by the writer Fredrik Beatner. "You are called to the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet." I would even go so far as to say that one of the more powerful outbreaks of happiness and meaning in your life will occur when you pair your passion and the world's need. Even as a child, my passion was writing. I felt back then, that I had found my small true light. Later on, of course, I lost it. Actually it was more like turning my back on it and finding something more practical. When I went to college in the sixties you found something that you could fall back on; at 29, however, I began to feel and internal sense of exile, a kind of homesickness, for my own place of belonging in the world. And on the morning of my 30th birthday I announced to my husband and to my two toddlers who were sitting at the table that I was going to become a writer, and they went right on eating their cereal.

I spent years studying the craft, practicing the art, developing my own voice. What I was doing during that time was having this conversation with myself about my own reach for excellence. And that is a very important conversation to have with your work.
However, I found out that it's about half the conversation.

Finally, one day I began to ask the other half of the question. And that is, "What does my work serve?" Not just, "how can I serve my work?" but "what does my work serve in the world?" And then the conversation got really interesting. I was in Chicago at a book signing for The Secret Life of Bees when a man approached me and he said, "I didn't want to read your book, but I read it anyway." It's not exactly the greeting you hope for. I ask him why he was resistant. And he said, "Well, I'm a 48 year old corporate executive from a large city in New England. I grew up in a very privileged family." And he pointed out to me that my novel was about a 14-year-old girl who grew up on a peach farm in the South and endures a lot of hardship. He said, "These worlds couldn't be more different."

I said, "Well why did you read it?" and he said, "My wife made me."

I teasingly ask him, "Well, was it very painful for you?" At which point he smiled and he confessed that he had actually made a surprising connection with my 14-year-old Lily and with the African-American women in the book. And he said this, and I have not ever forgotten exactly how he said it. "They had an effect on me that I can't explain. I just know that now I am more disposed to the South, to black women, and to little girls who need their mothers."

And I understood then that he had given me a reason to write fiction that was better than anything I was really coming up with, beyond just fulfilling my own need and desire to do it: Because it creates empathy. Most people, unfortunately, tend to go through the world maintaining their separation from others, more or less preserving that. But when we read fiction, we participate intimately in other people's lives. In their sufferings and ecstasies, in all the ways their lives fall apart and are shattered and are put back together again. And if their experience is different from ours, all the better.

The man in the bookstore helped me to deepen my conversation with myself about the purpose of my work in the world. What did it serve? Did it serve the world somehow? The truth is, it is hazardous to leave this out of the conversation. We no longer live in a paradigm of rugged individualism. We live in a paradigm of global community. And it seems to me that a vast number of our planetary ills can be traced back to one thing: a breakdown of community, from our inability to truly belong to the family of Earth — with all the care that that implies.

Now, understanding one's particular genius, one's particular purpose in the community is going to be perhaps the most indispensible ethic in the years ahead. In one of her poems, Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote, "Oh, world, I cannot hold thee close enough." Now we have to be honest and say that the world is not easy to cuddle up to. Neither is it is easy to embrace this big dysfunctional crazy family that populates the world. The world is rife with agonizes and with horrors. But it's also rife with beauty and goodness. For all its darkness, it is still ours.

And there simply comes a time in the maturation of a human being when you must embrace the world. Mother it a little, sister it, befriend it. It is your place of belonging. There is a provocative new idea afoot — I think it's very alive here at Scripps College — that says women are the emerging architects of change in the world. And it is now largely recognized that [applause] it is now largely recognized that women are the largest untapped resource on the planet.

Melanie Vanere, the new American ambassador for global women's issues said that, "The major problems in our world cannot and will not be solved without the massive involvement of women." Well, that would be you! That would be the applied genius, the applied genius of Scripps College women. Genius in Women: such a brilliant thing. The particular genius in you — which you all have — will only truly flourish when it is practiced on behalf of our world.

Speaking from personal experience however, it can be daunting to put your true self and your particular genius in the world in the hopes of making your contribution. Whenever there is a turning point in life — and you are at such a grand one — it is common for fear and thoughts of inadequacy to rise up in the vacuum of the unknown.

The trick is: do not let them keep you from diving in anyway. I assure you, I became a novelist by jumping in over my head, by airing on the side of audacity.
In my novel, The Secret Life of Bees, 14-year-old Lily, a motherless runaway, finds refuge among a group of African American women. One of these women is August Boatright, who lives with her two sisters in a pink house in which presides the statue of a black Madonna. The women turn to this icon for strength and consolation.

One day August says to Lily, "Listen to me now. I'm going to tell you something I want you to always remember. Okay? The black Madonna is not some magical being out there, like a fairy godmother. She's not the statue in the parlor. She's something inside of you. When you're unsure of yourself, when you start pulling back into small living and into doubt, she's the one inside of you saying, 'Get up from there and be the glorious girl you are.' That voice sits in your head, all day long saying, 'Lily, don't be afraid. Don't ever be afraid. I am enough. We are enough.'"

I'm not August Boatright, but I want to say something like that to you. Find a purpose grand enough for your life. And whatever your necessary fire is, your genius turns out to be, remember, in some way, it is necessary for the world too. Try to love the world despite what you see out there. Go make your big beautiful dent, and as you do so come down on the side of boldness. If you err, may it be for too much audacity, and not too little. For you really are enough.

You have untold strengths and resources inside. You have your glorious self.

Good morning, Stanford! Thank you very much, President Hennessy, for that very warm introduction. It is wonderful to be back at Stanford. Having gotten around a bit over the last few years, I am more convinced than ever that this is the best university on the face of the planet.

It’s particularly gratifying to be back in this stadium, which is a rather special place for me.

Stanford has had an enormous impact on my life. Not only is it where I met my husband, but it’s where I met the people, took the courses, and championed the causes that ultimately led me to make my career in international affairs. Stanford also taught me focus and discipline. Once you’ve learned to study in a bathing suit on the grass with muscled men throwing frisbees over your head, you can accomplish almost anything.

Let me join President Hennessy and start by recognizing the parents here today. For many families, your kids have been living far away from home. I grew up in Washington DC, and it is not a lie to say that I think my mother got over my decision to go to Stanford about three weeks ago. I still understand your pride in your children has no bounds. You have made great sacrifices to enable your kids to get such a tremendous education. So this is your day too. Parents, grandparents, family and friends, thank you for all you’ve done.

Class of 2010, first and foremost, congratulations. I suspect you’re feeling pretty good about yourselves right now. I remember feeling pretty good about myself too when I was sitting in your seats. In fact, I might have been feeling a little too good judging from how much I remember about my commencement speech.

Hold on to this jubilant moment and cherish your memories of this extraordinary place. Nurture the friendships you have made here. The warmth and security of Stanford can sustain you as you face an economy still climbing out of a deep hole and enter a world changing at a furious pace.

Imagine the world and what it will be like when one of you comes back a quarter century from now to deliver the commencement address. In 1986, when I graduated, the Soviet Union was bristling with 45,000 nuclear weapons, and the Berlin Wall was impenetrable. Nelson Mandela was clocking his 23rd year in prison in apartheid South Africa. Osama bin Laden was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda didn’t exist. Almost nobody had heard of global warming. Japan was the daunting economic powerhouse, and China’s share of global GDP was 2 percent. There were some 30 fewer countries in the world, and 2 billion fewer people on the planet.

We’ve seen amazing technological advances. In 1986, only 0.2 percent of the U.S. population had a cell phone, which were bricks about 10 inches long. IBM announced its first laptop which weighed 12 pounds. Twenty-four-hour cable news was in its infancy.

The face of America has changed too. In 1986, 8 percent of the U.S. population was Hispanic; today, it’s about 15 percent. The number of African Americans serving in Congress has doubled and the number of women and Latinos has tripled. If on my graduation day, someone had told me that I would live to see the first African American president, much less serve in his cabinet, I would have asked them what they were smoking.

So much change has transpired just in my adult lifetime and you will see so much more in yours but it doesn’t just happen. Progress is the product of human agency. Things get better because we make them better; and things go wrong when we get too comfortable, when we fail to take risks or seize opportunities. Never trust that the abstract forces of history will end a war, or that luck will cure a disease, or that prayers alone will save a child.

If you want change, you have to make it. If we want progress, we have to drive it.

Technology and trade helped transform a bipolar world into the deeply interconnected global community of the 21st century. Yet the planet is still divided by fundamental inequalities. Some of us live in peace, freedom, and comfort while billions are condemned to conflict, poverty, and repression. These massive disparities erode our common security and corrode our common humanity.

We cannot afford to live in contempt of each others’ welfare. It’s not just wrong. It’s dangerous. When a country is wracked by war or weakened by want, its people suffer first. Poor and fragile states can incubate threats that spread far beyond their borders, terrorism, pandemic disease, nuclear proliferation, criminal networks, climate change, genocide, and more. In our interconnected age, a threat to development anywhere is a threat to security everywhere.That makes the fight against global poverty not only one of the great moral challenges of all time but also one of the great national security challenges of our time.

So, here’s my challenge to you, become agents of change. Be driven by a passion to lift up the most vulnerable and to serve those with the least, both at home and around the world.For me, for so many reasons, this is a personal as well as a professional imperative.

One of those reasons is a little boy whom I met in war-ravaged Angola in 1995. I don’t even know his name. He was one face in a friendly mob of destitute little kids who greeted our delegation at a dusty camp for internally displaced persons in the middle of nowhere. He was perhaps 3 or 4 years old, with pencil-thin legs and a distended belly, and only a torn T-shirt to wear. He stood out because he had the most amazingly infectious smile. I walked up to him before realizing that the only thing I had to give him was the worn baseball cap I was wearing. I took it off, and put it gently on his head. The joy on his face remains etched in my mind to this day. I had to leave that camp, and when I did, I left that little boy in Hell.

I like to think and I sure hope that kid is OK but he could well have become one of the 9 million children under the age of 5 who die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable afflictions.Yet he has every right to live with the same dignity, hope, and security that my own son enjoys. They are both children of God, of equal worth, equal consequence, and equal rights.That little boy’s future is tied to ours; our security is ultimately linked to his well-being. So we must shape the world that he deserves.

That child deserves a world without the poverty that crushes the dreams of hundreds of millions. Half of humanity lives on less than $2.50 a day.

That child deserves a world without extreme hunger and dependence that it fosters. So we are investing in building poor countries’ capacity to feed themselves. Agricultural research has produced stronger crops that yield more, adapt faster, and better resist drought, disease, and pests. Yet Africa’s crop production remains the lowest in the world. With your generation’s leadership and ingenuity, you can make it the highest.

That child deserves a world where everyone can get a quality education. More than 70 million kids are not enrolled in primary school today, and 60 percent of them are girls. You can help close this gap, by joining Teach for America here at home or the Peace Corps abroad, by providing lunches for rural girls’ schools, by working to end child labor, forced marriage, and human trafficking, and by creating educational systems that reach all of our children.

That child deserves a world in which we find new cures for old plagues. You can be the generation to develop new vaccines for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, to use nanotechnology to create smart therapies that kill cancer cells and leave their healthy neighbors untouched, to provide needle-free immunizations to stop pandemics in their tracks.

That child also deserves a world whose climate isn’t collapsing, whose air isn’t choked by soot—and whose waters aren’t polluted with spewing oil. Imagine deploying clean-energy technologies to poor countries to power development without fossil fuels, much as China and Africa largely skipped landlines and leapfrogged to cell phones. You can be the generation that makes a green economy reality, that turns the fight against climate change into a boon for the developing world, not just a burden. You can be the generation that actually reverses global warming.

That child, and every child, deserves a world of greater opportunity, democracy, and hope. That is the world you can help forge.

Sometimes we innovate in great strides; sometimes we progress by slow and steady advances but progress we must.The fight against poverty is a challenge worthy of your generation that grew up in this interlinked age. The goal of a world free of famine and mass misery may seem distant but once, so were the moon and the microchip. The aim is ambitious but so are you.

As you go about changing the world, continuously challenge yourselves. Get out of your comfort zone. Go travel the world we share. Learn more languages. Get grit in your eyes, and sand in your hair, and service in your soul. Graduating from Stanford is great but it’s just the beginning.

So, don’t settle on a single path too soon. The last time I really was sure I knew what I wanted to do with my life was my senior year at Stanford. I was sure I wanted to be a United States Senator. I left for Oxford, certain I would go on to law school. To round myself out, I decided to study international affairs. After Oxford, I decided to skip law school but decided to sample the business world at McKinsey and Company, and I did so precisely because I was never any good at math and had literally never met a spreadsheet. I’ve not followed a pre-ordained path. Rather, I’ve tried to push myself, stretch myself, and learn new skills that would serve me whichever path I took. I’ve changed course and I’ve taken unexpected turns when my gut dictated. That’s led me to places I never expected but I’m grateful I’ve been.

So focus on what stirs your soul, because it’s hard to excel at anything that you don’t love.Be fearless. It is hard to make progress without breaking a little crockery and don’t be afraid to go down fighting, if you’re fighting a righteous battle. Stick to your guns and to your principles. Remember, you should never want something so badly that you do something you don’t believe in to get it. At the same time, don’t sweat too much what other folks may think of you. As Dr. Seuss said, “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.”Be about more than money. Comfort and economic security are good, but they’re not enough. You should be about creating change, not just counting it.

Finally, as you’re changing the world, never neglect family. They’re not just your foundation; they’re the source of life’s greatest fulfillment, as all the parents here can testify. Both my parents were recently struck by serious illnesses. My colleagues were tremendous about stepping in for me at the halls of the United Nations but nobody could step in for me or for my brother at the hospital. There’s usually somebody else who can do your job but there’s nobody else who can be a loving child or a devoted parent.

Like those before you, your generation will contribute; it will innovate and it will serve in unique ways. Today, change is coming faster than ever and you must shape that change. You can be that change, not for an election but for a lifetime.

If you remember nothing else of what I’ve said, try to remember that little boy. Remember that he is somebody’s beloved son. Remember that he counts as much as any of us. Remember that we cannot afford to sleep easy while he suffers. Remember that you can make his life better. Above all, remember that each of us has a profound responsibility to try, with all our skill, all our smarts, and all of our soul. So make him safe. Make progress. Make us proud.

Congratulations again, and Godspeed.

It is an incredible honor to be here today to celebrate you and your families as you graduate from the very best public university in the world!Thank you for inviting me! Eighteen years ago, I was sitting where you are, at my graduation at Cal. Since then, things have changed. When I graduated, there were no cell phones, no Wi-Fi, no text messages. Students went to the library because it was the only place to look things up, there was no World Wide Web!

But the Internet definitely changed everything. An example of this: I have this friend of mine, she told me that she finally told her boyfriend she loved him, and she said she did it via email! I said, “You did?” I am kind of old fashioned. Then she said, “and I cc’d his family, and I bcc’d his two ex-girlfriends.”

That’s just a perfect example of how much you can get accomplished so quickly with technology today! They recently announced they were getting married on Facebook. I’m sure she’ll announce her pregnancy on Twitter.

You could say UC Berkeley is in my DNA. In 1961, my mother came to Cal from Detroit to be where the action is, the Free Speech Movement was just starting. My step-mother graduated from Cal. My father, a surgeon and author, gave lectures here. My big sister and brother went to Cal and told me all about all the best professors (and parties). And one night, five years after I graduated, I met an amazing guy who was an artist and who does research in robotics. I learned that he was a professor … at Cal! We’ve been married ever since. Now Professor Goldberg is my favorite collaborator, and guess where we hope our daughters, Odessa and Electra, ages one and seven, will go to college? Go Bears!

When I graduated in 1992, it didn’t seem like such a great time in the world. We were at war in the Middle East. And we were in a very bad recession. There were not a lot of jobs waiting for graduates. Sound familiar?

But I truly believe that it is in these challenging times that there is unique opportunity to do something different because you have to. There is no obvious path leading you forward. No lucrative jobs to lure you away from what you really want to do. You have to figure it out on your own. So you get to take risks. There are no rules. Times like this are my favorite times! You get to find your passion and follow it.

Growing up, both of my parents loved what they did for a living. They worked very hard to get there. They both were the first in their families to graduate, not just from college, but to get doctorates—my father as a doctor and my mother as a psychologist. So I had always known you had to work very hard. But that it is also important to do something you absolutely loved doing because if you did something you loved and were passionate about, it wasn’t work.

UC Berkeley has the highest number of graduates who are the first in their family to graduate from college. It is such an amazing achievement for you and your family. You are blazing a trail! And all the women graduating, the only reason we’re here today is because of the trail our mothers and grandmothers blazed for us. Now, we definitely need to make that trail wider, making more space for women in new roles in society, but I am so thankful that all of you women graduating are here today to help push on that edge. My father used to always say, “If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much space.”

So when I was graduating, there was never a question on whether it was possible to do what I loved, and it was no problem that was I a woman. I wanted to make a feature film.

But I had to figure out how I was going to get there, and how to get there quickly. I am not the most patient person. I had made short films in college, and I was determined to make a feature. The fact that I had no money to do this wasn’t going to stop me. I heard that Spike Lee had made his first feature film using his credit card. So I started charging things. I asked all my friends to volunteer, posted a casting call, and soon I had hundreds of crew and actors. The concept for the film was that it would take place entirely within someone’s mind where ideas were represented by people. At one point, I wanted to shoot a scene with forbidden thoughts being imprisoned on Alcatraz. But, I didn’t have the money or a way to shoot there. So I went to the phone book and looked up the number for the head of the National Park Service who ran Alcatraz Island. He actually picked up the phone. I told him all about the film and how excited we were about doing a movie shoot there, but we had no money, and then he paused … and then he said, “OK. You can come next week and stay all night. And I’ll arrange a boat to bring you and your crew.” So we did!

The moral of that story… moxie. A lot of doors have opened when I have invoked a little moxie. It’s like this magic potion. Now, moxie was originally the name of a medicine to build up your nerve. But these days, it is a mixture of being bold, fearless, and a little outrageous.

I never finished that film. It’s all sitting unedited in my garage. I ran out of money and felt I let everyone down. I was depressed. It was a huge personal failure, and humbling and important. That three-year ordeal made me appreciate every success after that, big and small, in a way I never would have. And I look at it now as totally and absolutely necessary and one of the best lessons of my career. Also, I think that whole experience of being the director of 400 people working for free taught me that you better make it fun and interesting. So I have tried to keep that spirit when I am working on any project since then. Another lesson I learned from that experience: It’s okay to fail, and fail BIG. I think you learn the most from those kinds of experiences, and it laid a lot of foundation for what came next.

To climb out of debt from that film, I did a lot of jobs in technology. I had been into computers since I was young. During that period, I was 24 years old, living in Seattle working on this music CD-ROM, and my roommate called me over to his computer and said, “You have to see this new invention called the Web!” He showed me the first website I had ever seen. There were people from London and Japan that were connecting with him on his computer and posting their thoughts on music. I remember that moment so clearly. I was absolutely blown away by its potential, people connecting and sharing ideas through computers.

I got more and more excited about how this new thing called the Web was going to change the world. I wanted to help more people get to know this new medium. I moved back to San Francisco and, in 1996, I was given the opportunity to create the Webby Awards from scratch, to honor the world’s best websites. I was ready to take another risk.

At the time, many people either didn’t know about the Web or didn’t understand the Web. It was too complicated, too geeky. So I set out to help make it fun, accessible, and exciting by honoring the people doing experiments that worked online. My idea was to re-imagine the Academy Awards—fun, edgy, and exciting. Acceptance speeches had to be five words or less. My favorite Webbys speech was when Al Gore won a Webby Award and said, “Please don’t recount this vote.”

This time, I didn’t use my charge card. I raised money from sponsors. I had that same enthusiasm to engage people on what this could be. I talked about the power of the Web. I also once again picked up the phone. I called the Mayor of San Francisco, explained what I was doing and asked if he’d speak at our nascent awards ceremony. He wasn’t sure what the World Wide Web was, but he said, “O.K.” We needed judges, so we created a name for as big as we wanted it to be, “The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences,” and invited David Bowie and Francis Ford Coppola. They said, “O.K.” And it was wonderful to spend my time thinking of unique ways to honor people, to basically say “good job” to people in a really big way. An amazing ripple effect of good things can happen when you recognize people for their good work.

The next few years were incredibly exciting. Interesting people were coming out of the woodwork. All the old rules were being broken. There were really no set rules on what to do. Again, my favorite times.

At one point, Mayor Giuliani wanted to bring The Webbys to New York City, and a bidding match ensued between him and Mayor Willie Brown. It was a surreal time, I was 28 years old and the mayors were fighting over The Webbys. I was also being flown to New York to do regular appearances on “Good Morning America,” and at the fourth annual Webbys, two young men who no one knew rollerbladed onto the Webby Awards stage to win a Webby. They were the founders of Google.

At this time, the Bay Area felt like the center of the universe. If you were young and under 30, the world was yours. Then, in 2000, the Internet bubble burst. It was a very difficult time. Websites were shutting down, sponsors left, and we had to lay off much of our staff which was very hard. Many people said the Internet was a fad. That it was going to go away. We knew this wasn’t the case and kept on going with a leaner team. But it was a hard time.

Then 9/11 happened. So many people did a lot of soul searching during that period, including me. After working years of 70-hour weeks, Ken and I wanted to start a family. I wanted to make more impact more efficiently so I could have time to be a mother, too. And while I loved the power of technology to connect people, I wanted to get back to making films, but this time on social issues, combined with the power of the Web to make change in the world.

This was before YouTube, and people were just beginning to show films on the Web. And it was also starting to be an exciting time in filmmaking, because suddenly when you made documentaries, you could truly connect with the people that watched them to engage them to make change. And the whole filmmaking structure was changing with the Internet. Again, there were no rules. So, while doing the Webbys, I started also making films about issues I cared about, like reproductive rights and cultural identity. I got to experiment with film online. At the Webbys, we continued to honor people, but we tightened our belts and worked very hard to keep honoring people and to strengthen the organization. We brought in partners from New York.

When I look back on my ten years doing The Webbys, it was an exciting time, but it was a lot of work, as everything is. But if you do what you love, it doesn’t feel quite like work. So at this point, I was in my late thirties, able to focus on making documentaries with my filmmaking team, and we were doing experiments in engaging people on social change.

Ken and I had a wonderful daughter, Odessa, and I was able to work from home a lot to be with Odessa because of the Internet. I think in many ways the Internet was the tool the feminist movement needed to help fulfill its dream of doing both. And I was able to work on a new feature film called “Connected,” about what it means to be connected in the 21st century. Life was going so well. Then, in 2008, my father, who I am extremely close with, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. That same week, I found out I was pregnant again.

For the next nine months, I was focused on life and death each day. I talked with my father about everything. I filmed him. I said everything I wanted to say to him, and he said everything he wanted to say to me. It was difficult and intense. I was so scared at the thought of life without him.

Then, a year ago exactly this week, on May 11th, after this nine-month battle with cancer, my father died. Days later, I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. It made me think about what it means to be “connected” in a whole new way. It made me think of life in a whole new way. How valuable and fragile it is. How short it is. How important it is to be present, to remember to take the time to “unplug” from all the technologies. How important it is to tell everyone you love them, thank them, share with them, to say what you’re grateful for every day, write it down, say it out loud. How you have to give it all that you’ve got in this lifetime. How valuable the knowledge is that our parents and our teachers teach us.

And while I was so worried what the world would be like without him, today I understand that everything he taught me still guides me. And all that he taught me I will pass to my daughters. It also made me want to give all that I’ve learned and all the energy that I have to give to my family, my community and this world!

The whole experience pushed me to think deeply about how I can make the world a better place, which is probably what you’re thinking about right now. Questions arise like, “What’s the best way to move forward with all that I have learned,
with all that you’ve been given to make the world better?” Because, as we all know, the world needs us right now.

We’re facing a vast array of interconnected problems. The economy, the environment, expanding women’s rights, overpopulation, progress without thinking of consequences, health care, nuclear proliferation, access to education, and the massive oil spill in the ocean, just to name a few.

We’ve faced many of these problems before, but because the world is so much more connected, and there are so many more people, the stakes are that much higher. And these problems today are so intertwined. A problem in one area has the potential to affect people everywhere. And it just keeps getting more complex as the systems become more complicated. And the negative ripple effects are so much greater.

But the good news is that you and I have everything we need to know to make things right. The Talmud has this saying, “When you teach your children, you teach your children’s children.” You embody all that your professors taught you and also your parents, and what their professors and parents taught them. You all stand here at the forefront of civilization embodying all that we have learned collectively as humans, pushing that edge. Pushing towards understanding things more completely, making things better!

All of you today came of age, in this great moment in human history, where technology is beginning to connect everyone on the planet. Today, one billion people are online. So while I thought it was exciting when the Web started 15 years ago, I realize now that with one sixth of the planet online, the scale of that, the power of that, it’s infinitely more exciting now! Think about the possibilities with that many people participating, experimenting, sharing information, collaborating! Just imagine the day when all 7 billion people are able to connect.

Think about it. If someone asked you, “If you could be alive during any time in history, what time would it be?” The invention of fire?Of agriculture? What if you could be alive when everyone on the planet is becoming connected? This is an amazing opportunity to make things right. The Internet has given our world a central nervous system! What an amazing time to be alive! An amazing time to be graduating in 2010 from UC Berkeley!

The web has, in many ways, taught us how to think about links and look at how things are connected. John Muir said it beautifully when he said, “When you tug at a single thing in the universe, you find it’s attached to everything else.”

In the past 10,000 years, we have been struggling to make sense of our world by breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces. We’ve dissected, and looked into microscopes, and specialized in our knowledge. This reductionist approach has been extremely successful: It brought us the clock, calculus, electricity, the Theory of Relativity, so many of the brilliant ideas and breakthroughs you learned here at Cal.

“Divide and conquer” has been our primary strategy for centuries. But now it’s time to focus on how to put things together. It’s time to look for connections, to look for information to help us understand connections and build connections.

As we spend so much time these days searching, looking and finding all this information, what becomes that much more important is understanding context for that information you find. The good news is that a great education at UC Berkeley provides that context that you need. And looking at how the world is connected is exactly the context we need to find solutions with this perspective, and all these amazing tools are at our fingertips to connect the dots. We can find new ways to share ideas to help solve the problems facing our planet and our species. New, bold ideas will come from engaging all different perspectives and different minds in solving these problems. It will take us to a new place. A leap in understanding.A leap in doing.A leap in making things better for everyone.

Examples of this are everywhere and just at a nascent stage. Like how Wikipedia has helped us all gather the knowledge, or how we were able to mobilize action for Haiti and raised $30 million dollars by texting. I think the next step will be engaging all the minds to help solve the problems of our day.

I truly believe we are at the beginning of a new Zeitgeist. Today, we are seeing that shift in action. We are shifting to this way of thinking, of looking at the world as a system—a system in which everything affects everything else. We need to look at the world this way.

Now, that can at times feel very overwhelming, like, “How can I possibly make a difference in such a complicated system with so many problems?”

But the good news is, if you want to make change in a system, you just need to make a small change, and you can have a huge positive ripple effect, too!

Look at what can happen when you educate young girls and women in developing countries and offer economic opportunities. Huge ripple effects of positive change. Impact can spread far and wide in an ever-changing dynamic ecosystem of nature, people, ideas and action! You just need to figure out what strand you are going to pull on.

So, what will be your strand? Margaret Meade once said: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”

Throughout our history, it’s been necessary to break things down in order to understand them. We’ve gotten really good at that. We’ve been doing it for long enough. But for the sake of our future, now it’s time to put the parts back together. I am so excited that you are graduating today and will join us in this effort. You know these tools better than anyone. I cannot wait to see what you will do to help us make the world a better place!

For centuries, we’ve been declaring independence. Perhaps it’s time to declare our interdependence! I invite you to join me in kicking off an experiment today, where we are asking you and graduates from all over the world to declare your hopes and thoughts for the future. I believe if you can name it, you are that much closer to making it happen. There are six of my film crews here to film you after the ceremony. The info is on your seats. And all 11,000 of you in this theater, I hope you and I can stay connected, through Facebook or Twitter. We can ignite a lot of social change if we do it together!

Graduates, please be sure you thank your parents and the people who allowed you to be here today. I know they are so proud of you. I know my father would have been so proud to be here today. And my mother who continues to guide me is here in the theater. I made a short little film just for you graduates, covering a few things to remember on your journey: Have moxie. Think big. Fail big. Laugh at yourself. Make a difference. And one more thing before you fly out of here…I leave you with my favorite quote, by Goethe:“Whatever you think or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic to it.”

Congratulations Class of 2010! Your journey is ahead. Begin it. Be bold. Thank you.

It’s a tremendous honor and a privilege for me to be here with all of you. To be back to a place that really feels like home to me, and to be back to a place that brings back so many fond memories. Auburn has played a key role in my life and continues to mean a lot to me, as anyone who comes in my office at Apple or my home in Palo Alto instantly discovers. I have so much Auburn memorabilia you might think it was a California outpost for J&M or Anders.

As thrilled as I am to be here I stand before you knowing that the lives of many people here and even more across our state and beyond are deeply affected by the tragedy off our shores. I grew up on the Gulf Coast and my family still lives there and I want you to know that my thoughts and hopes are with you.

Also as thrilled as I am to be here, I stand before you with a deep sense of humility both because of how I got here and who is here. I am where I am in life because my parents sacrificed more than they should have. Because of teachers, professors, friends, and mentors who cared more than they had to. And because of Steve Jobs and Apple who have provided me the opportunity to engage in truly meaningful work every day for over 12 years. And I know that I’m offering words of advice in front of a faculty whose ideas and research positively impact our lives. And I do so in a gathering where the faculty is complemented by the hard-won wisdom of so many parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents that have been a source of incredible inspiration for today’s graduates.

So bearing all that in mind I’ll share some personal discoveries with you that have at least served me well. Discoveries based on this most improbable of journeys that I have been on.

My most significant discovery so far in my life was the result of one single decision: My decision to join Apple. Working at Apple was never in any plan that I’d outlined for myself, but was without a doubt the best decision that I ever made. There have been other important decisions in my life, like my decision to come to Auburn. When I was in high school some teachers advised me to attend Auburn, other teachers advised me to attend the university of Alabama and, well, like I said some decisions are pretty obvious. The decision to come to Apple which I made in early 1998 was not so obvious. Since most of you graduates were 10 years old at the time you may not realize that the Apple in early 1998 was very different than the Apple of today. In 1998 there was no iPad or iMac or iPhone, there wasn’t even an iPod–I know it’s hard to imagine life without iPods. While Apple did make Macs, the company had been losing sales for years and was commonly considered to be on the verge of extinction. Only a few months before I’d accepted the job at Apple, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Computer, was publicly asked what he would do to fix Apple, and he responded “I’d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.” In making this statement what distinguished Michael Dell was only that he had the courage to say what so many others believed.

So Apple was in a very different place than it is today, and my employer at the time, Compaq Computer, was the largest personal computer company in the world. Not only was Compaq performing much better than Apple, it was headquartered in Texas and therefore closer to Auburn football. Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq’s favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq. One CEO I consulted felt so strongly about it he told me I would be a fool to leave Compaq for Apple.

In making the decision to come to Apple, I had to think beyond my training as an engineer. Engineers are taught to make decisions analytically and largely without emotion. When it comes to a decision between alternatives we enumerate the cost and benefits and decide which one is better. But there are times in our lives when the careful consideration of cost and benefits just doesn’t seem like the right way to make a decision. There are times in all of our lives when a reliance on gut or intuition just seems more appropriate–when a particular course of action just feels right. And interestingly I’ve discovered it’s in facing life’s most important decisions that intuition seems the most indispensable to getting it right.

In turning important decisions over to intuition one has to give up on the idea of developing a life plan that will bear any resemblance to what ultimately unfolds. Intuition is something that occurs in the moment, and if you are open to it. If you listen to it it has the potential to direct or redirect you in a way that is best for you. On that day in early 1998 I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best. It’s hard to know why I listened, I’m not even sure I know today, but no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius, and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company. If my intuition had lost the struggle with my left brain, I’m not sure where I would be today, but I’m certain I would not be standing in front of you.

This was a surprising lesson. I recall how uncertain I was at my own commencement about where my life would lead. There was a part of me that very much wanted to have a 25-year plan as a guide to life. When I went to business school we even had an exercise to do a 25-year plan. I found mine, now 22 years old, in preparing for this commencement address. Let’s just say it wasn’t worth the yellowed paper it was written on. I didn’t understand it then as a young MBA student, but life has a habit of throwing you curve balls. Don’t get me wrong–it’s good to plan for the future, but if you’re like me and you occasionally want to swing for the fences you can’t count on a predictable life. But even if you can’t plan, you can prepare. A great batter doesn’t know when the high-hanging curve ball is going to come, but he knows it will. And he can prepare for what he will do when he gets it.

Too often people think about intuition as the same as relying on luck or faith. At least as I see it, nothing could be further from the truth. Intuition can tell you that of the doors that are open to you, which one you should walk through. But intuition cannot prepare you for what’s on the other side of that door. Along these lines a quote that has always resonated with me is one by Abraham Lincoln. He said “I will prepare, and some day my chance will come.” I have always believed this. It was this basic belief that led me to Auburn to study industrial engineering, led me to co-op alternating quarters while attending Auburn, led me to Duke to study business, and led me to accept so many jobs and assignments that are too numerous to mention.

In business as in sports, the vast majority of victories are determined before the beginning of the game. We rarely control the timing of opportunities, but we can control our preparation. I feel Lincoln’s quote is especially appropriate now, given the state of the economy and the worry that I suspect a number of you must feel. I had the same worry when I graduated in 1982 (yes, I am prehistoric, for the record). But as many of the parents here will remember, the economy then bore some strong similarities to the economy today. The unemployment rate was in the double digits, we didn’t have the collapse of Wall Street banks but we did have the savings and loan crisis. I worried, as many of my classmates did, what the future held for them.

But what was true for Lincoln was true for those of us who graduated in ’82, and it is true for those of you graduating today. Prepare and your chance will come. Just as all previous generations have done you will stand on the shoulders of the generation that came before you. The generation of mine and your parents. And you will achieve more and go farther. The fact that you are here now at this great institution, in this great state, at this great moment for both you and your families is a testament to the fact that your preparation has begun. Continue to prepare yourselves as you have at Auburn, so when your gut tells you “this is my moment,” you are without a doubt ready.

If you are prepared, when the right door opens then it comes down to just one more thing: Make sure that your execution lives up to your preparation. At least for me the second sentence of the Auburn creed, “I believe in work, hard work” really resonates here and has been one of my core beliefs for as long as I can remember. Though the sentiment is a simple one, there’s tremendous dignity and wisdom in these words, and they have stood the test of time.

As current events teach us, those who try to achieve success without hard work ultimately deceive themselves, or worse, deceive others. I have the good fortune to be surrounded by some brilliant, intuitive thinkers who create the most elegant and extraordinary products in the world. For all of us intuition is not a substitute for rigorous thinking and hard work: It is simply the lead-in. We never take shortcuts. We attend to every detail. We follow where curiosity leads, aware that the journey may be longer but will ultimately be more worthwhile. We take risks knowing that risk will sometimes result in failure. But without the possibility of failure, there is no possibility of success. We remember Albert Einstein’s words: “insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results.” When you put it all together, I know this: Intuition is critical in virtually everything you do, but without relentless preparation, and execution, it is meaningless.

So those are my discoveries on the significance of intuition, preparation, and hard work. For me they give rise to a simple principle for the most important decisions in your life: Trust your intuition and then work with everything you have to prove it right.

Logic probably dictates that I end my remarks here, but as I’ve said sometimes logic shouldn’t prevail, and so I have one last brief discovery to share with you. I think it is misleading to talk about success without also referencing failure. I know of no one who has achieved something significant without also in their own lives experiencing their share of hardship, frustration, and regret. So don’t believe that something in your past prevents you from doing great work in the future. To all of you who doubt yourselves, I have been there too, and although today I’ve spent time talking about a great decision, I’ve made some that are far from it. And like many of you I’ve had my share of life’s personal challenges and failures. But after many miles on my journey I recognize that each of these difficult periods of life passes, and with each we exit stronger and wiser. The old saying “This, too, shall pass” has certainly proven true for me and I’m sure it’ll hold true for anyone who believes it.

So paint in your mind the most grand vision where you want to go in life. Prepare, trust in, and execute on your intuition. And don’t get distracted by life’s potholes. Congratulations, class of 2010, this is your day. This is your moment. You’ve received a first class education, from a first class institution. Congratulations to your families and friends who have supported you. And as important as this day is, make sure that you carry the Auburn spirit in the weeks, months, and years ahead. Let your joy be in your journey–not in some distant goal. And regardless of where your particular journey may lead you from this moment forward, thank you for allowing me to play a small part in today.

President Celeste and Jacqueline. Trustees, Alumni and friends. Teachers families, and above all the inspired members of the Colorado College Class of 2010. Thank you all for the privilege of being with you on this very special day

A graduating class that sparkles with such creativity, such lightness of being, deserves to hear a few remarks that veer somewhat away from the conventional. So I promise you from the start that I am not going tell you how messed up the world is, as if you didn’t already know, and then lay on you the obligation to go out and fix it. What college class has ever graduated into a world free of troubles?

Commencement addresses always remind me of a Colombian farewell, a despedida. I lived for a long time on a farm in Medellin with an old campesino, Juan Evangelista Roja. For a Colombian there’s no such thing as a casual leave taking, and for Juan, it was inconceivable that I might depart on expedition without a long afternoon in the local roadhouse. Each of his sisters and brothers- and one would discover at such moments with stunning clarity just how many there were- would wax eloquent about the prospects of the journey, its promises and hazards, with each prognosis followed en sequida by a stiff shot of trago that brought the soft hues of sunset alive at midday.

The afternoon grew charged with threatening earthquakes, impossible rapids, train wrecks, sorcery, volcanoes, floods of rain, horrendous unknown diseases, and sly deceitful soldiers with the demeanor of feral dogs. Thieves lurked at every crossroads except on the north coast. There everyone was a thief. “Life is an empty glass” Juan would say, “It’s up to you how fast you fill it.” Inevitably Rosa, his twin sister, would then begin to cry. That was the signal. One had to get out fast or make new plans for the night.

Let Me Tell You a Story that begins on a ridge in Borneo, close to dusk with thunder over the valley and the forest alive the electrifying roar of black cicadas. I was sitting by a fire with an old friend, Asik Nyelit, headman of the Ubong River Penan, one of the last nomadic peoples of Southeast Asia.

The rains, which had pounded the forest all afternoon, had stopped and the light of a partial moon filtered through the branches of the canopy. Earlier in the day Asik had killed a barking deer. Its head roasted in the coals.

At one point Asik looked up from the fire, took notice of the moon and quietly asked me if it was true that people had actually journeyed there, only to return with baskets full of dirt. If that was all they had found, why had they bothered to go? How long had it taken, and what kind of transport had they had?

It was difficult to explain to a man who kindled fire with flint and whose total possessions amounted to a few ragged clothes, blowpipe and quiver of poisoned darts, rattan sleeping mat and basket, knife, axe, two dogs and three monkeys- a space program that had consumed the energy of a nation and, at a cost of nearly a trillion dollars, placed 12 men on the moon.

Or the fact that over the course of six missions, they had travelled 1.5 billion miles and indeed brought back nothing but rocks and lunar dust, 828 pounds altogether.

Asik’s question provoked the timeless answer. The true purpose of the space journeys, or at least their most profound and lasting consequence, lay not in wealth secured but in a vision realized, a shift in perspective that would change our lives forever.

The seminal moment came on Christmas Eve, when Apollo 8 emerged from the dark side of the moon to see rising over its surface not a sunrise but the Earth itself ascendant, a small and fragile planet, floating in the velvet void of space. This image more than any amount of scientific data showed us that our planet is a finite place, a single interactive sphere of life, a living organism composed of air, water, wind and soil. This revelation, only made possible by the brilliance of science, sparked a paradigm shift that people will be speaking about for the rest of history.

Almost immediately we began to think in new ways. Just imagine. Thirty years ago simply getting people to stop throwing garbage out of a car window was a great environmental victory. No one spoke of the biosphere or biodiversity; now these terms are part of the vocabulary of school children.

Like a great wave of hope, this energy of illumination, made possible by the space program, spread everywhere. So many positive things have happened in the intervening years. In little more than a generation, women went from the kitchen to the boardroom, gay people from the closet to the altar, African Americans from the back door and the woodshed to the White House.

What’s not to love about a country capable of such scientific genius, such cultural capacity for change and renewal?

Like many of you my politics run right down the middle. I tire of those who fuel the flames of fear as much as I tire of those who speak of American conspiracies. I’ve never met an American who could keep a secret let alone mount a conspiracy.

Some time ago I was part of a year-end panel on a national news program, supposedly discussing all the problems the country faced in the coming year. I say supposedly because the four of us were essentially foils for the celebrity host to play off as he whipped the broadcast into a frenzy of hysteria. When the topic turned to immigration, he invoked every conceivable cliché before pouncing on me like a hawk for a solution to the crisis. What should Americans do, he asked. I replied, Learn Spanish.

But let me share one other amazing revelation of science. It’s the moon shot of your generation. It too will be remembered for a thousand years. Indeed nothing in our lifetimes, yours or that of your parents, has done more to liberate humanity from the parochial tyrannies that have haunted us since the birth of memory.

It too came about at the end of a long voyage of discovery, a journey into the very fiber of our beings. Over the last decade geneticists have proved to be true something that philosophers have always dreamed. We are all literally brothers and sisters. Studies of the human genome have left no doubt that the genetic endowment of humanity is a single continuum. Race is an utter fiction. We are all cut from the same genetic cloth, all descendants of a relatively small number of individuals who walked out of Africa some 60,000 years ago and then, on a journey that lasted 40,000 years, some 2500 generations, carried the human spirit to every corner of the habitable world.

But here is the amazing idea. If we are all cut from the same fabric of life, then by definition we all share essentially the same mental acuity, the same raw genius. So whether this intellectual potential is exercised through technological innovation, as has been the great achievement of the West, or through the untangling of complex threads of memory inherent in a myth, a priority of many other peoples in the world, is simply a matter of choice and orientation, adaptive insights and cultural emphasis.

There is no hierarchy of progress in the history of culture, no Social Darwinian ladder to success. The Victorian notion of the primitive and the civilized, with European industrial society sitting proudly at the apex of a pyramid of advancement that widens at the base to the so-called primitives of the world has been thoroughly discredited. The brilliance of scientific research, the revelations of modern genetics, has affirmed in an astonishing way the essential connectedness of humanity.

The other peoples of the world are not failed attempts to be us, failed attempts to be modern. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question. What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked that question they respond in 7000 different voices, and these collectively comprise our human repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species even as we continue this never ending journey.

What this means for you is very simple. There are tens of thousands of teachers out there in every corner of the world that you did not even know you had.

You can sail with Polynesian wayfinders, navigators who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessels, knowing full well that every island group had its own reflective pattern that can be read with the ease with which a forensic scientist reads a finger print.

You can follow the Tendai monks in Japan, who as part of their initiation run 17 hours at a stretch every day for seven years, wearing out five pairs of sandals a day.

You can join a caravan of blue robed Taureg in the searing sands of the Sahara, or hunt narwhal with the Inuit in the light of the midnight sun. Sit by the side of a Bodhisattva in a Tibetan cave, or study medicine at the foot of an Amazonian shaman.

Or you can pursue completely different avenues of adventure and discovery, in science, the arts, social justice, engineering, medicine, the military or the clergy. No generation has had so many options, or shown such promise.

All these grandiose sentiments aside, many of you may be thinking.

Yes, but tell me honestly what good is my liberal arts degree?
What has it prepared me to do? I know the feeling. When I graduated I had studied anthropology and travelled two years in the Amazon. My mother called, “What now?” I told her I had no idea. She screamed, “You’re 23 years old!”
I took a job in a logging camp, no doubt driving to distraction my father who had spent half his savings sending me to college. I later worked as a park ranger, a river guide, and at one point applied to law school and graduate school in botany, as if they were the same thing. My father had to wait nearly ten years to see any return on his investment. He died with a copy of a review of my first book in his pocket.

That year in the logging camp actually turned out to be one of the best things I ever did. When battles over the fate of Canada’s temperate rainforests raged a decade later, it gave me an authority that few on either side of the conflict could challenge.

A career is not something that you put on like a coat.

It is something that grows organically around you, step-by-step, choice-by-choice, and experience-by-experience. Everything adds up. No work is beneath you. Nothing is a waste of time unless you make it so. The months I spent in that logging camp and later working as a hunting guide were as formative in my life as the time I spent in the Amazon studying with shaman, or the many years I was at graduate school. An elderly cab driver in New York may well have as much to teach you as a wandering saint in India, a madman in the Sahara.
Many of you are understandably concerned about finding employment. After all last year 70% of graduating college seniors in the USA failed to land a job. Perhaps it will make you feel a bit better to remember that the word job is derived from the 16th century French word, gober, meaning, “to devour”. My father had a job all of his life. He called it the grind. I used to think as a young boy that he went into the city every day and returned a little smaller.

Fortunately I have never had a job, at least not in this sense. Actually I have never really had a job at all. And knowing what I do about the spirit of CC I don’t imagine many of you will find a single slot into which to plug your entire existence.

But what you will do is work, and no doubt as ferociously hard as I have all my life. The word work has a better ring to it. It comes from the old English, meaning action and deed.

And you’ll find that the work you do is just a lens through which to view and experience the world, and only for a time.

The goal is to make living itself, the act of being alive, one’s vocation, knowing full well that nothing ultimately can be planned or anticipated, no blueprint found to predict the outcome of something as complex as a human life. If one can remain open to the potential of the new, the promise of the unimagined, then magic happens and a life takes form. This, I promise, will happen to each one of you.
Let me tell you about three remarkable friends.
Steve graduated from college with a liberal arts degree, having no idea what to do next. So he went to India, where he stayed for four years, living in a cave. He knew it was time to come home when the local people started bringing him money. So he came back to the States and meditated for 65 days, trying to figure out what to do. Suddenly he had a flash. Vegetable protein!

Now the person who told me this story was driving me to the airport, and he turned to me in a conspiratorial tone and whispered, “You know how hard that is.” I had no idea what he was talking about. But Steve had figured out that the problem with soy milk was not the product but the container, which relegated it to the weird food section of the grocery store. So he changed the name, soy and milk becoming Silk, packaged it to look like milk cartons and placed it beside the milk in the dairy section. Five years later Steve sold his company for $295 million.

My friend Matthieu grew up in a life of privilege in Paris. His father was France’s most illustrious philosopher. His mother was a famous painter. Their home was filled with intellectual celebrities. Matthieu learned photography from Cartier-Bresson. Stravinsky taught him to play piano. He discovered anthropology with Claude Levi Strauss. Matthieu himself became a molecular biologist, studying at the Pasteur Institute in the lab of a Nobel Laureate. But at some point he realized that there was no correlation between fame, wealth, and happiness.

So he returned to the Himalaya, the one place he had found contentment, and became ordained as a Tibetan monk. For a dozen years he served as the personal attendant of a revered teacher Khyentse Rinpoche, sleeping on the wooden floor of the lama’s chambers. When Rinpoche passed on, Matthieu returned from Bhutan to Katmandu. One day his father came for a visit, and they decided to spend a week at a teahouse talking things over. Encouraged by a publisher, they taped their conversations. The result was a book The Monk and the Philosopher that went on to sell more than a million copies. Matthieu today is a confidant of the Dalai Lama, personal advisor to the president of France, and author of scores of books, including one simply entitled, Happiness, which has been the top selling book in France for more than a year. No mean achievement given that the French don’t even believe in the notion of happiness!

And finally there is Martin, perhaps my wildest friend. He graduated from college and decided to paddle the Río Piraparaná, a remote tributary in the Northwest Amazon of Colombia. He stopped at an Indian hut, and was curious to see an old treadle sewing machine. He was more surprised to discover that the elder had bought the thing from a rubber trader some 30 years before and was still paying off the debt. So Martin decided on the spot to start a rubber company, undercutting all the competition by giving the Indians fair and just prices. He was adopted by the Tanimukas, and ended up getting his doctorate in anthropology, having spent three years learning the language, understanding the myths. Everything was achieved because of the power of his heart.

Martin came to the attention of the Colombian President, Virgilio Barco, who told him to do something for the Indians. In five extraordinary years Martin as Head of Indian Affairs, did more than something. He secured legal lands rights, encoded in the 1991 constitution that gave the Indians title to an area of the Amazon the size of the United Kingdom. The result was a cultural rebirth unlike anything ever seen in South America.

So what do these characters have in common? For one they could all readily be graduates of Colorado College. They are inspired, imaginative, playful and original. They are all three opportunists. Not in the sense of being schemers.

They simply learned to put themselves in the way of opportunities.

Hemingway once said that the most important preparation for a writer is to have led an interesting life, to have something important to tell the world. What Martin, Matthieu and Steve all discovered is a universal lesson. If you place yourself in situations where there is no choice but to move forward, no option but success, you create a momentum that in the end propels you to new levels of experience and engagement that would have seemed beyond reach only years before.

Creativity is a consequence of action, not its motivation. Do what needs to be done and then ask whether it was possible. Orthodoxy is the enemy of invention, despair an insult to the imagination.
To parents I say please be patient. The best of things come out of those incapable of compromise. It takes time for an individual to create a new world of possibilities, to imagine and bring into being that which has never before existed, the wonder of a full and realized life.

And to the graduates Please give as much thought to the person you will become as to the vocation you will pursue.

When I was your age, living in the mountains of Colombia, a Kamsa Indian told me something I have never forgotten.

“In the first years of your life,” Pedro said, “You live beneath the shadow of the past, too young to know what to do. In your last years you find that you are too old to understand the world coming at you from behind. In between there is a small and narrow beam of light that illuminates your life.”
If you can look back over a long life and see that you have owned your choices, then there is little ground for resentment. Bitterness comes to those who look back with regret on the choices imposed upon them. The greatest creative challenge is the struggle to be the architect of your own life. So be patient. Do not compromise. And give your destiny time to find you.

Thank you very much and God bless you all.

Thank you, Kent.

I think after what you heard you must be impressed. But I trust that you are smart enough to know why I am invited to give your commencement. My office is only a few meters from here and it will not cost the Institute any travel expenses, but the truth is that it's only a lunch, free lunch today, and I expect to get a raise with my salary.

Chairman Kresa, Members of the Board of Trustees, President Chameau, Former Presidents Baltimore and Everhart, Provost Stolper, Division Chairs, Faculty, Vice Presidents, Staff, Distinguished Guests, and above all our Graduates:

When President Chameau asked me to give this year's commencement address, I was in fact delighted, and I am indeed honored to be here today with you, your families, and our entire Caltech community.

But what can one say to the very bright graduates of Caltech that will be different from what they already know? And if you are like my own children, you do not really wish to have a lecture on what you should and should not do.

So I decided instead to share with you some personal experiences in the hope that you may see why you are fortunate to reach this milestone, and to reflect on what you can do with your fortune to forge a new future.

I speak wearing different hats. Like you, I have learned a great deal by being part of the unique academic structure of Caltech. As a faculty member and concerned citizen of the world, I have also acquired knowledge -- and hopefully some wisdom -- about global affairs. And perhaps of special importance to today's celebration is that my own family, like yours, has witnessed the joy of college graduation.

Nearly twenty years ago, I stood in this very stage and handed my own daughter a Caltech science degree.

My dear graduates, today you will receive a degree, but soon you will discover that this special event is only a first step on a long road. In fact, in many ways, today marks a new beginning in your life. This rebirth is lauded in a commencement ceremony and the tradition which dates back to the Middle Ages is a service in celebration of and thanksgiving for lives dedicated to learning and wisdom: learning you have achieved by following the light of knowledge, and wisdom you have acquired from experience and mentoring with love from your family, who supported you throughout your journey.

I take this opportunity -- and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the graduates to give a standing ovation to their own parents. Will you please stand up and give your parents a standing ovation.

Please sit down. (And by the way, the last stimulus check from your parents will be cashed today.)

You are living in a special age, the age of information, and you came to Caltech seeking new knowledge. Information itself is not necessarily useful knowledge, and both information and knowledge are not sufficient to synthesize wisdom. One needs a proper education combined with experience -- and it helps to have, of course, good genes, so try to choose your parents well.

My message from the outset is simple: always be guided by the light of knowledge and wisdom to shape your future, the future of your country, and the future of the world.

When I came to the United States in 1969, I was not dreaming of a Nobel Prize (or a Pulitzer prize), nor I was dreaming of acquiring a Bill Gates fortune. Armed with the excellent education I received in Egypt, I was simply on a quest for knowledge and a Ph.D. degree from a reputable institution in this land of opportunity.

Incidentally, my English was so poor that at restaurants, I used to order "deserts" for desserts.

America was a magnet for many members of my generation because of its leadership in science and technology and its unique democratic values. The historic landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon in 1969 was enough to demonstrate America's outlook on the new frontiers of knowledge.

I was aware of Edison's dictum, "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration," and I took advantage of being in the right place at the right time -- of being in America and at Caltech.

In fact, it was Caltech's ambiance and the country's system of support that made it possible for a young assistant professor to carry out, with his team, research that in only ten years' time would define a discipline that was recognized by the Nobel Prize in 1999.

People often ask me, How does one get a Nobel Prize, and what is the secret of success? (And incidentally, the same people had no interest in asking this question before I received the prize.) I believe it was passion for science that supplied the energy and it was optimism that made the almost-impossible, possible.

My dear graduates, success comes to the prepared mind. Success is not like rain that falls from the sky equally upon everyone. Success is what you reap when you sow with passion and optimism.

Times have changed. The world is more complex, and the America of today is not the one I came to in 1969. We are now in the so-called "global age", threatened by chemical, biological, and nuclear disasters,  and the United States faces real challenges: the rise of economic super-powers such as China and India, the conflicts in the world overseas, and -- most importantly, in my view -- the change in cultural, educational, and political values.

Yes, there are challenges and changes, but you can still make your own success in your own way because you are fortunate enough to have received an exceptional education in a twenty-first century, developed-world society.

Your education is unaffordable to at least eighty percent of the six billion people on the planet who make merely a dollar a day. As importantly, America continues to provide you with opportunities that even today you will not find anywhere else in the world.

And here, in this country, you are free to speak and worship as you please, and you can sleep at night without fear of the government or police. These fundamental values are embedded in the foundation of this country, which is built on pillars of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

Our world today is full of opportunities, and you, the Caltech graduates, have a unique role to play because of the special education you received in the sciences and engineering and the rational thinking that this education has instilled in you.

Do not listen to pessimists; rather, forge ahead to share your experience in whatever field you are passionate about, which could be business, government, law, art, or science. I do not know the future of business or politics, but I know the future of science.

Your generation and the ones after yours will continue to seek a basic understanding of nature and will make the many exciting discoveries that lie ahead -- from the deciphering and control of the most fundamental constituents of matter to discoveries at our universe's boundaries, and to the unveiling of our origin and the miracle of life.

Your generation will also explore other planets and possibly reach out to other galaxies.

You now sit just a few miles from JPL, where Mars Science Laboratory rover is being built for launch in November of this year. When the rover, named Curiosity, lands in August of next year, it will perform the first ever precision landing on Mars and help us assess whether the planet can harbor life.

Beyond these and other intellectual achievements, there are direct benefits to peoples' liberty. From early in history, the quest of knowledge has been a driving force of revolutionary change, not only causing paradigm shifts in our understanding of the cosmos but also acting as an agent for the naissance and renaissance of human societies.

The European Renaissance would have been impossible without enlightenment about the significance of knowledge and the rational thinking. I think too much credit is given to the impact of politics on the progress of society. Without science there is no development, and politicians would be unable to promise prosperity.

Just think: What would our world be like without electricity, penicillin, and the airplane? From the agriculture and industrial revolutions to today's genomics and IT revolutions, science is at center stage for societal advancement, and Caltech graduates will surely play a leading role in conquering the next frontiers of discovery, innovations, and progress.

Even in politics, technology is becoming the new weapon for transformative change in society. The youth of your generation are now harnessing information technology to do what those of my generation thought impossible.

Elsewhere in the world, there still exists oppression, occupation, and human suffering; and young people are revolting to acquire liberty from repressive regimes. The hope I witnessed first hand in Egypt is a telling indication of a new role for science in democracy.

You are aware, no doubt, of the peoples' revolution sweeping the Middle East as I speak. I witnessed in real time the Egyptian uprising that began on January 25th of this year, and, remarkably, led to the removal of Mr. Mubarak in only eighteen days.

I saw university students in the hundreds of thousands, and then people in [the] millions, marching toward Tahrir Square in Cairo. The name of the square means "liberty", and that is precisely what the youth wanted from a thirty-year-old regime. They demonstrated peacefully, with impeccable organizational skills and in unison.

In my generation, we would probably have had to use stones, sticks, and guns in order to rise up; in your generation, they used Facebook, Twitter, and SMS. Without the development of the chip, wireless technology, and the Internet, this revolution may never have succeeded as a peaceful and civilized transformation.

Although the road ahead is bumpy, I am optimistic that with investment in education and development, again through science, a democratic Egypt will emerge. You may be interested to know that only a few months after the revolution, Egypt announced -- announced the establishment of a New City for Science and Technology on three hundred acres of land, and guess which university model will be followed -- your soon to be alma mater, Caltech's!

When people in the Middle East ultimately gain their freedom, the world will be better off. Some scholars argue that the world is destined always to be embroiled in conflicts and wars. But this bleak picture is surely not the result of a natural phenomenon.

We the people cause such conflicts, and we the people can either kindle the fire or help to extinguish it. The United States cannot change the culture of other people, and nations are responsible for their own plights, but it is the kismet of the United States to lead in the world by utilizing its most valuable force: the American value system of individual liberty, justice, and human rights.

I believe that much can be achieved not by hegemony but by the strategic use of the real force of America -- its soft power. The soft power of science has the potential to reshape global diplomacy -- and at significantly lower expense than that needed for use of the hard power of military involvement.

I am hopeful that a new national policy will be charted for leadership in innovation. This policy should be inclusive of international science diplomacy for partnerships in development. Some may argue that it is naïve to think of applying such idealistic values in our imperfect world, but directing the influence of science diplomacy is in the best interests of the United States.

Through the power of knowledge, we can efface ignorance and shape a future that binds cultures and civilizations. In his recent Cairo speech, President Barack Obama articulated a new initiative for cooperation and partnership that emphasizes the role of science and diplomacy, particularly with the Muslim-majority countries.

Earlier, the President appointed me to his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and later I became U.S. Science Envoy to the Middle East. I embarked on a diplomatic mission that took me back to where I came from, but now with a different objective. From touring and seeing the state of science and education, not only in the region, but also globally, I believe we will face serious consequences if we do not choose to act.

I recently read an important study that left me awestruck by the demographics of knowledge across our planet's population. In [Educating All Children]: A Global Agenda, Joel Cohen and David Bloom argue that the aim of achieving primary and secondary schooling for all the children is urgent and feasible, and yet more than three hundred million children will not be in school in the year.

Every effort should be made to change this state of affairs so that we may hope for a better future for our world.

So, the twenty-first century education that you are fortunate to have received at Caltech is far-reaching. It reaches beyond the classical boundaries -- not just across so-called interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields, but also between nations and maybe soon even across planets.

Perhaps the best words to describe the value of education and knowledge are those of Thomas Jefferson. In 1782 in his Notes on Virginia, he wrote:

The general objects [of a bill to diffuse knowledge more generally through the mass of people] are to provide them education adapted to the years, to the capacity, and the condition of everyone and directed to their freedom and happiness.1

Remarkably, Jefferson, more than two centuries ago, saw the virtue of education on the individual and global level.

My dear graduates, this commencement is the initial stage of a developmental process. It is a beginning of a long voyage. In this journey, invest your fortune of knowledge wisely and forge your place and time into opportunity. Have a dream and work hard to realize that dream as did the great man who spoke these resounding words, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:

Without hard work, we are not entitled to a good life -- and without compassion, we will not attain the good life in a world-majority population of have-nots.

The investment of your family and your country in you was made for a good reason. You need a good education to lead a fuller, richer life; the country needs you to build its future; and the world will be a better place when knowledge replaces ignorance.

Congratulations to the Class of 2011.

Friends, Romans, countrymen: lend me your beers. I am honored that you chose me to help you celebrate your graduation today. I can only assume I am here today because of my subtle and layered work in a timeless classic entitled "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". And for that I say, you're welcome. I'm truly, truly delighted to be her at Harvard . I graduated from Boston College. Which some call the Harvard of Boston.

But we all know that Harvard is the Harvard of Harvard. And you can quote me on that. I have to admit I am very surprised to be here because like so many of you, I was pretty convinced the Rapture was going to happen. Show of hands, how many of you woke up on Sunday and thought, "You're kidding me! I sold all of my belongings, I told my boss to shove it and we are still here?" I understand how you feel. I am so mad at Heaven right now. So I tried to write today's speech the way I wrote everything in College. Stayed up all night, typing on a Canon word processor while listening to Sir Mixalot. To be fair, first I took a nap, I ate a large pretzel, I cried a little bit and then I went to see that movie, Fast Five. And I am here to tell you, life is like a heist that requires good drivers, an explosives expert, a hot girl who doubles as a master of disguise and this is a hard and fast rule. If the Rock shows up, they're on to you. But the class of 2011 did not invite me here to tell jokes. They invited me here to talk about the recent tensions between oil traders regulators of the commodities futures trading commission. I'm sure we all read the New York Times this morning which posited that there may be a complex scheme that relied on the close relationships between physical oil prices and the prices of financial futures, which of course, as we all know, moves in parallel. Hilarious.

What do I know about Harvard? I know it is the oldest American university. I know it provides the ultimate experience in higher learning and according to the movies, I know it is filled with people who get rich either by inventing things or sueing the people who they claim stole their invention. Let me be clear. I believe everything I see in movies. And if you remember anything I say today, remember this. Every single thing you see in movies is real.

So, what do the fine students of 2011 need to hear from me? If I wanted to give you advice as a Bostonian, I would remind you that: (with accent) "Just because you're wicked smart it doesn't mean you are better than me."

And I would also want to say (with accent) "Good for you for working so hard, you graduated from Hahvard, it must be nice."

If I wanted to give you advice as a New Yorker, I'd tell you, "Excuse me, ma'm, could you move please? Don't walk in the bike lane, get off the bike lane please." And I would also like to take a moment to inform you as a New Yorker and as my cab driver did recently that Bloomberg pretends to take the subway, but we all know that's a bunch of baloney. And if I wanted to give you advice as an actor, I would tell you this: don't do it. Don't be one. There are too many. I have a lot of talented friends who aren't working. Sorry, no more room at the inn. I bet you are great, but just work with the human genome instead. You're all smart and sophisticated people. You know the world in a way that my generation never did. Because of that, I realize I don't have much advice to give to you. In many ways, I learned from you. I don't have many answers, just questions. Specifically, when I use Facetime on my iPad and I'm talking to someone and I take a picture, sometimes the screen freezes. How do I fix that?

All I can tell you today is what I have learned. What I have discovered as a person in this world. And that is this: you can't do it alone. As you navigate through the rest of your life, be open to collaboration. Other people and other people's ideas are often better than your own.

Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. No one is here today because they did it on their own. Okay, maybe Josh, but he's just a straight up weirdo. You're all here today because someone gave you strength. Helped you. Held you in the palm of their hand. God, Allah, Buddha, Gaga.

Whomever you pray to.

They have helped you get here, and that should make you feel less alone. And less scared. Because it has been a scary ten years. You were young children when you watched planes hit the World Trade Center. You quickly understood what it was like to feel out of control. Your formative teenage years were filled with orange alerts and rogue waves and unaccomplished missions. For my generation, it was AIDS. We all grow up afraid of something. Your generation had to get used to taking off your shoes at the airprot. My generation had to get used to awkward PSAs from Boyz2men telling us to use protection. But during those tough times, we realized how wonderful it felt to be part of a group.

But more about me. I moved to Chicago in the early 1990s and I studied improvisation there. I learned some rules that I try to apply still today. Listen, say yes, live in the moment, make sure you play with people who have your back, make big choices early and often. Don't start a scene where two people are talking about jumping out of a plane. Start the scene having already jumped. If you are scared, look into your partner's eyes. You will feel better. This advice has come in handy and it would often be something I would think about when I would perform on Saturday Night Live. Live television can be very nerve-wracking and I remember one time being nervous, looking into the eyes of the host and feeling better. I should point out I was wearing a chicken suit at the time. The host was Donald Trump. He was wearing a bigger, more elaborate chicken suit. I looked into his eyes, I saw that he looked really stupid, and I instantly felt better. See how that works? I should point out that that sketch was written by a Harvard graduate and also a graduate from Northwestern but who cares about that, am I right?

I cannot stress enough that the answer to a lot of your life's questions is often in someone else's face. Try putting your iPhones down every once in a while and look at people's faces. People's faces will tell you amazing things. Like if they are angry or nauseous, or asleep. I have been lucky to be a part of great ensembles. My work with the upright citizens brigade led me to my work on Saturday Night Live, and when I graduated from that comedy college, I was worried about what came next. Then Parks and Recreation came along, a show I am proud of where I get to work with people I love. You never know what is around the corner unless you peek. Hold someone's hand while you do it. You will feel less scared. You can't do this alone. Besides it is much more fun to succeed and fail with other people. You can blame them when things go wrong. Take your risks now. As you grow older, you become more fearful and less flexible. And I mean that literally. I hurt my knee on the treadmill this week and it wasn't even on. Try to keep your mind open to possibilities and your mouth closed on matters that you don't know about. Limit your "always" and your "nevers." Continue to share your heart with people even if its been broken. Don't treat your heart like an action figure wrapped in plastic and never used. And don't try to give me that nerd argument that your heart is a batman with a limited edition silver battering and therefore if it stays in its original package it increases in value. Watch it Harvard, you're not better than me.

Even though, as a class, you are smart, you are still allowed to say, "I don't know." Just because you are in high demand, you are still allowed to say, "Let me get back to you." This will come in handy when your parents ask when you plan to move out of their basement and you answer, "I don't know. Let me get back to you." Which leads me to my final thought: would it kill you to be nicer to your parents? They have sacrificed so much for you, and all they want you to do is smile and take a picture with your weird cousins. Do that for them. And with less eye-rolling, please. And so, class of 2011, it is time to leave. Oprah has spoken.

So I will end with this quote: Heyah, Heyah, Heyah, Heyah, Heyah, heyah, heyah, heyah, alright alright alright, alright, alright. The group: Outcast; the song: Heyah. The lyrics: nonsense. I'm sorry it was really late when I wrote this.

This is what I want to say. When you feel scared, hold someone's hand and look into their eyes. And when you feel brave, do the same thing. You are all here because you are smart. And you are brave. And if you add kindness and the ability to change a tire, you almost make up the perfect person. I thank you for asking me to speak to you today. As you head out into the world I wish you love and light, joy, and much laughter. And as always, please don't forget to tip your waitresses. Thank you very much.

President Lawrence, Board of Trustees, members of the faculty—proud parents, family, and friends, and above all the graduating class of 2011,I'm deeply honored and grateful that you have invited me to be a part of such a seminal moment in your lives. The fact that I have two daughters in college—one a senior next year, the other a sophomore—makes this all the more meaningful for me.

This is the most magical, incredible place. I was here last night for dinner at the president's beautiful home, and I met an alum who had been here together with her mother—at the same time! No, they did not share a room. I met a trustee who is a second generation man in this college. I met a student graduating today who is leaving for Paris and has already written her memoir. There were surprises around every corner, and as you can imagine, I did not want to leave.

You are very lucky to have President Lawrence, a James Joyce scholar, at the helm of your school. Actually, it's a little known fact that my original idea when I launched The Huffington Post in 2005 was to call it Huffington's Wake. It was going to be full of puns and allusions to Greek mythology. And it was going to have a blog by Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus. Nobody was actually going to read it, but everyone was going to pretend to have read it.

So…you made it! Congratulations! And I know it doesn't matter, and it's not as important as everything else, but you look amazing!

If you look at the world you are graduating into, it's a split screen world. And depending on what part of the screen you are looking at, you will have a dramatically different perception of what the world looks like… and it will alter everything you think about the present—and especially about the future. On one half of the screen: the old world is exploding in a pre-scientific, almost medieval eruption of irrationality and anger, where nothing can be known for certain, facts don't matter, and truth can be nullified by assertion.

It's a world in which the head of the IMF, who was on course to become president of France, is arrested on charges of attempted rape; a world in which the former governor of California had to admit to having a child with his housekeeper ten years ago. (As an aside, don't these stories make you long for more women leaders? When was the last time a woman leader was accused of rape?)

It's also a world in which we have 70 percent of people in this country who think we are on the wrong track. In which the American Dream is fading, with almost 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed. And in which for the first time, total outstanding student loan debt will be higher than total credit card debt—going over $1 trillion. And the percentage of young adults moving back in with mom and dad has jumped to a staggering 34 percent.

And it's also a world in which we have senators and presidential candidates who don't believe in evolution and who think that global warming is a myth… a world in which politicians don't just have their own set of ideas but their own set of facts. But there is another world, and that's the world you're creating. While the media are obsessing over Donald Trump's presidential run or Kim Kardashian's latest boyfriend, your generation is busy creating another world. On this part of the split screen there is an explosion of creativity, innovation, empathy, and compassion. You are the most connected and engaged generation in history. And you are asking the big questions and contemplating the cosmic riddles about why we're here and what life is really about.

In the 1990s I wrote a book called The Fourth Instinct, which explored the instinct that takes us beyond our first three—our impulses for survival, sex, and power—and drives us to expand the boundaries of our caring to include our communities and the world around us. That instinct is just as vital as the other three but we rarely give it the same kind of attention.

Which is unfortunate because these days—and especially since the economic meltdown—the role empathy plays in our lives has only grown more important. In fact, in this time of economic hardship, political instability, and rapid technological change, empathy is the one quality we most need if we're going to survive and flourish in the 21st century.

Just before he died, Jonas Salk defined the transition we're in as moving from Epoch A (based on survival and competition) to Epoch B (based on collaboration and meaning). During this seismic shift in our world, in which values are changing, the most important thing that we are missing is not IQ, but wisdom. That's why I love your school's motto—Wisdom With Understanding. Because nothing matters as much.

Wherever you look in the world, there are brilliant leaders in business, media, and politics making terrible decisions every day. What they're lacking is not intelligence but wisdom. Because leadership, after all, is seeing the icebergs before the Titanic hits them.

In the third century, before even Twitter existed, the philosopher Plotinus described three different sources of knowledge: opinion, science, and illumination. Illumination—or wisdom—is precisely what we most need today. Part of wisdom is recognizing that there is a purpose to our life that may not be immediately obvious as our life unfolds. Things —especially the biggest heartbreaks—often only make sense as we look back, not as we are experiencing them.

I remember, for example, in my 20s, when I fell in love with a man whom I had not met. I fell in love with his writing. His name was Bernard Levin, and he was writing for the London Times. I would literally cut out his columns, underline them, and learn them by heart. When I finally met him, I was petrified and tongue-tied. Nevertheless, he invited me to dinner, and I prepped for the date not by going to the hair dresser but by reading everything he was writing. I read every detail about Northern Ireland. Of course, Northern Ireland never came up on the date… and we ended up being together for seven years. Then I hit 30 and I desperately wanted to have children. He wanted to have cats. So I did something that I was terrified to do: I left the man I deeply loved. And basically everything that's happened in my life—my children, my books, The Huffington Post, the fact that I'm here speaking in front of you today—is because a man wouldn't marry me.

Remember that, okay? In life, the things that go wrong are often the very things that lead to other things going right. Or as Max Teicher, who is graduating today, put it to me last night: he was bumped from an art class he really wanted to be in because there were already too many kids enrolled, but because of that he ended up in a philosophy class he really loved. So, to quote Max, “by getting unlucky, I actually got lucky. ”

A key component of Wisdom is Fearlessness, which is not the absence of fear, but rather not letting our fears get in the way. I remember one of the low points in my life, when my second book was rejected by 37 publishers. By about rejection 25, you would have thought I might have said, “hey, you know, there's something wrong here. Maybe I should be looking at a different career. ”

Instead, I remember running out of money and walking, depressed, down St. James Street in London and seeing a Barclays Bank. I walked in and, armed with nothing but a lot of chutzpah, I asked to speak to the manager and asked him for a loan. Even though I didn't have any assets, the banker—whose name was Ian Bell—gave me a loan. It changed my life, because it meant I could keep things together for another 13 rejections.

And then I got an acceptance. In fairytales there are helpful animals that come out of nowhere to help the hero or heroine through a dark and difficult time, often helping them find a way out of the forest. Well, in life too, there are helpful animals disguised as human beings—like Ian Bell, to whom I still send a Christmas card every year. So, very often, the difference between success and failure is perseverance. It's how long can we keep going until success happens. It's getting up one more time than we fall down.

Of the many things my mother taught me—including the delightful notion that "Angels fly because they take themselves lightly"—the one that's proved most useful in my life is the understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's an integral part of success.

And that means not letting the fears in our heads get in our way. Not letting that voice of doubt, which I call the obnoxious roommates living in your heads, have the last word. Because, as Montaigne said, “There were many terrible things in my life, but most of them never happened. ”

I work with great engineers every day, creating amazing apps. But I think what we really need is a killer app that gauges the state of our mind, body, and spirit and automatically offers the exact steps we need to take to realign ourselves and course correct. Call it a GPS for the soul.

I love the tradition at Sarah Lawrence in its early women-only days of "productive leisure. " Students occupied themselves each week with activities such as gardening, crafts, tap dancing, observing stars and French conversation. The notion of productive leisure is more important than ever in our hyper-connected, always-on world. I call it unplugging and recharging.

When my mother died, I realized that she and I had been different in one key way: She lived in the rhythm of a timeless world, a child's rhythm; I lived in the hectic, often unnatural rhythm of the modern world. While I had the sense every time I looked at my watch that it was later than I thought, she lived in a world where there were no impersonal encounters, where a trip to the farmer's market happily filled half a day, where there was always enough time for wonder at how lovely the rosemary looked next to the lavender. In fact, going through the market with her was like walking through the Louvre with an art connoisseur—except that you could touch and smell these still lifes. It would be a real blessing if you can integrate that timeless rhythm into your hectic, everyday lives.

As Nicholas Carr wrote, "there needs to be time for efficient data collection and time for inefficient contemplation, time to operate the machine and time to sit idly in the garden. " There's not a lot of garden left in the world you're heading into—so, when you find it, stop and savor the stillness. Do not miss your life by multitasking. A key, and often-overlooked aspect of recharging is also one of the most obvious: getting enough sleep. There is nothing that negatively affects my productivity and efficiency more than lack of sleep. After years of burning the candle on both ends, my eyes have been opened to the value of getting some serious shuteye.

And in the macho boys' club atmosphere that dominates many offices, women too often feel they have to overcompensate by working harder, longer, and later. In fact, lack of sleep has become a sort of virility symbol. I was once out to dinner with guy who kept bragging about how he only needed four hours of sleep a night. I wanted to tell him that he'd be much more interesting if he'd gotten five. Sleep and productive leisure can be keys to tapping into our wisdom—as is making our lives about something more than ourselves.

In a study on the roots of altruism, psychologist Dr. Ervin Staub analyzed men and women who had risked their lives during WWII to protect Jews hiding from the Nazis. "Goodness," he wrote, "like evil, often begins in small steps. " Small steps that frequently lead to much larger commitments—and can have ever-widening positive reverberations through our communities.

But of course it seems that all of you have already discovered this at Sarah Lawrence, with many of you serving in many different ways: at the Early Childhood Center, at a “Right to Write” prison program, at an art exhibition in the Yonkers public library, doing theater outreach in public schools, working on affordable housing and with the homeless, etc, etc. And I would love to invite all of you to write on The Huffington Post about what you're doing, because it inspires others and puts the spotlight on the good that's being done.

Marketers, who pride themselves on being ahead of the curve, are already tapping into our growing collective desire to do good. I was sitting in a hotel room the other night, when a commercial grabbed my attention. It began with somber piano music, followed by a voice-over: "Millions of people,” it said, “everyone out for themselves. . . can this really be the only way?" We then see images of various people doing the right thing, helping someone push-start a broken down car, tired firefighters after fighting a blaze. The commercial ends with the tag line: "Here's to doing the right thing," And do you know what that commercial was for? Chivas whiskey.

If Chivas whiskey feels that altruism is a good way to sell scotch, you know there's something in the zeitgeist.

This moment in history demands that we stop waiting on others—especially others living in Washington—to solve the problems and right the wrongs of our times. So as you are leaving this beautiful campus behind, please don't wait for leaders on a white horse to save us. Instead, turn to the leader in the mirror. Tap into your own leadership potential because the world desperately needs you. And that means daring to take risks and to fail, as many times as it takes, along the way to success—and, more important, to re-making the world. And to do it all with more balance, more joy, more sleep, and more gratitude. Thank you so much.

Trustees, faculty, friends, family, but mostly graduating seniors. Congratulations. I’m happy to be a part of this glorious day and happy to be back at Middlebury. It’s never hard to get me to return to this beautiful place, though invariably someone reminds me that I wouldn’t get in now. So, to you graduating seniors, I say thank you from my parents. You’ve made their investment back in the late ’80s and early ’90s that much more valuable. I’m not sure there’s a market that will let them sell high, but people look at me differently as a result of that piece of paper that hangs on the wall in my office. Thank you.

To me the beauty of Middlebury is the community, and we will come back around to that at the end. I know some of you have yet to go to bed, squeezing those last few drops out of the community. No need to worry, that community, those friends, don’t end today. Instead the community grows. Three of my best friends graduated seven years before I did. I used to think that the admissions office did a great job and I still do, but it must be something else. Maybe it’s the mud season that lasts from March right up to exams, when the tantalizing sun pops out just as you’re about to learn a semester’s worth of Macro Economics. Maybe it’s the runs on the golf course or covered bridge during the fall foliage. Maybe the hikes up Snake Mountain. Maybe those cold, wet November winds sliding off the Adirondacks and right through you. Maybe the relationships with friends, professors, deans. Ben and Jerry’s at lunch and dinner. No matter where you go you will have a Middlebury friend.

As I competed throughout the world my teammates asked me how big is that school? Mt. Hutt, Vail, Val d’ Isere, Sydney, Atlanta. No matter where I went there was always a Middlebury friend there. It’s a tight group. There is resentment however. Oh, you’re another Middlebury person. To those who resent, they had a choice. They just chose wrong.

These speeches are supposed to have a theme. So I’ll tell you what that is right now, “It’s not what happens to you. It’s what you do with what happens to you,” which happens to be the philosophy on which I’ve based my foundation. As I sat in my office trying to figure out what to say, there was a piece of a song in my head. “No straight lines make up my life.” I struggled for the connecting lyrics, but couldn’t move past that one line. I searched my mind for the singer, thinking it sounded ’60s, ’70s, and maybe a woman. Nothing, so I hit Google.

Harry Chapin, the ’60s/’70s storyteller.

“No straight lines make up my life. All my roads have bends, there’s no clear-cut beginning and so far no dead ends.”

No matter who we are. No matter how well educated we are. No matter how successful we are. No matter how well we insulate ourselves, something will happen that cuts us to the bone. Something will force us to question ourselves and the formative decisions that we’ve made. Whether death of a loved one: parent, friend, child, disease, accident, divorce, bankruptcy, something will happen. That’s when the idea of it’s not what happens to you, it’s what you do with what happens to you, comes into play.

A couple of years ago I returned home from a long trip. I’d been in Tibet, so it was 16 hours of driving over bumpy dirt roads to China and then a flight halfway across the world back home. At home I wanted to get my mail. I have one of those collective mailboxes at the end of the street. I parked my car and started pulling my chair out, putting the wheels on when this little girl rode by on her little pink bike with streamers coming off the handlebars.

She might have been six. She said, “What happened to your legs?”

Now, I’ve just flown halfway across the world. I didn’t really feel like having a conversation with a six year old. Nothing against six year olds, I just didn’t feel like having a conversation with one. But, from the time we’re little we’re taught not to stare at someone who looks different, aren’t we? So I told the girl, “I was a ski racer in college. My first day of Christmas vacation my brother and I went to our home mountain to train. With some childhood friends we took a couple of warm-up runs. My ski popped off in the middle of the turn. I fell in the middle of the trail, hitting nothing but the ground.”

I tried to explain it in a way that she could understand, “You know those little bumps on your back. Those are bones. They protect your nerves, which carry messages from your brain to the rest of your body. I broke two of those bones, damaging the nerves, so the messages don’t go from my brain to my legs and my legs back to my brain.

I didn’t know how I was doing. Apparently pretty well. She said, “You’ll never walk again?”

I said, “No. Probably not.”

As she rode away, she said, “That’s too bad.”

I wish that I’d stopped her. If I’d never had my accident I never would have been the best in the world at anything. I was the best monoskier in the world. I never would of turned a hobby into a profession. Wouldn’t have acted in a soap opera. Wouldn’t have had the guts to address all of you. Wouldn’t have been in People magazine. I wouldn’t have competed as a professional athlete for 15 years after I graduated. I wouldn’t have met presidents and heads of state. The Dalai Lama (okay, maybe I would have met the Dalai Lama because I met him here). That little girl saw the tragedy, but she didn’t see the potential gift.

I know that all of you have great plans. Some plans are better formed than others, but don’t be bound solely to those plans. Life is fluid. Sometimes when things don’t work out, it’s the greatest gift of all.

How often have we all said, “The best laid plans of mice and men,” partially quoting a line from Robert Burns, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry and leave us nothing but pain and sorrow for promised joy.”

The author, plowing his field at the end of the season, cuts through the mouse’s home destroying it. He laments the coming, cold, dark skies of winter, all the hard work by the mouse, the loss of a cozy little home. The mouse just runs away. At one point recently I said to my yoga teacher that I thought I still needed some form of acceptance for my accident. She said, “It’s not acceptance. It’s just a change in direction.”

People often ask me if I could go back and change history would I? It took me a while at first because it would be great to be six feet again. When you’re 4’10” the view doesn’t change that much and it’s often not that great.

I wouldn’t trade the accident for the experiences that I’ve had. I wouldn’t trade walking for the person that I’ve become. It makes me wonder. Looking back at myself when I was in college my plans weren’t well formed, but I can tell you for a fact that they didn’t include any of what I’ve done, and also I know for a fact that there wouldn’t have been any “straight lines.”

We started with the idea of the community. You are joining the Middlebury Alumni, which is an amazing community, but there needs to be something more. Look around. If this is your community, what does it say about the world as you see it? Everyone is intelligent, good looking, at least relatively well off, motivated, creative, hard working, successful. This community represents such a small part of the world.

When I had my accident my world switched. I spent 20 years as a white male, suddenly in a moment I became a minority. I didn’t think I’d changed but the way people treated me changed. I often see the best and most generous side of people, but I also see the most condescending and dismissive side as well.

If we are going to be successful, we need to create a community that is successful, a community that allows us to risk and fail in order to succeed. I started with the theme of “It’s not what happens to you. It’s what you do with what happens to you.”  Sometimes we need to give someone a hand up, just to reach that point.

Holocaust survivor and psychologist, Viktor Frankl said, “Success like happiness can’t be pursued. It must ensue as the unintended byproduct of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself.”

As you leave this wonderful community and join an even more wonderful one, remember that you are responsible for creating the community around you, bringing others into that greatness.

Thank you. Congratulations. Best of luck.

Before I begin, I must point out that behind me sits a highly admired President of the United States and decorated war hero while I, a cable television talk show host, has been chosen to stand here and impart wisdom.  I pray I never witness a more damning example of what is wrong with America today.

Graduates, faculty, parents, relatives, undergraduates, and old people that just come to these things ----Good morning and congratulations to the Dartmouth Class of 2011.  Today, you have achieved something special ----- something only 92 percent of Americans your age will ever know:  a college diploma.   That’s right, with your college diploma you now have a crushing advantage over 8 percent of the workforce.  I’m talking about dropout losers like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg.   Incidentally, speaking of Mr. Zuckerberg, only at Harvard would somebody have to invent a massive social network just to talk with someone in the next room.

My first job as your commencement speaker is to illustrate that life is not fair.  For example, you have worked tirelessly for four years to earn the diploma you’ll be receiving this weekend, and Dartmouth is giving me the same degree for interviewing the fourth lead in Twilight.  Deal with it.  Another example that life is not fair: if it does rain, the powerful rich people on stage get the tent. Deal with it.

I would like to thank President Kim for inviting me here today.  After my phone call with President Kim, I decided to find out a little bit about the man.  He goes by President Kim and Dr. Kim.  To his friends, he’s Jim Kim, J to the K, Special K, JK Rowling, the Just Kidding Kimster, and most puzzling, “Stinky Pete.”  He served as the chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, spearheaded a task force for the World Health Organization on Global Health Initiatives, won a MacArthur Genius Grant and was one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2006.  Good God, man, what the hell are you compensating for?  Seriously.  We get it; you’re smart.  By the way Dr. Kim, you were brought to Dartmouth to lead, and as a world-class anthropologist, you were also hired to figure out why each of these graduating students ran around a bonfire 111 times.  

But I thank you for inviting me, Stinky Pete, and it is an honor to be here.   Though some of you may see me as a celebrity, you should know that I once sat where you sit.  Literally.  Late last night I snuck out here and sat in every seat.  I did it to prove a point ---- I am not bright and I have a lot of free time.

But this is a wonderful occasion and it is great to be here in New Hampshire, where I am getting an honorary degree and all the legal fireworks I can fit in the trunk of my car. 

New Hampshire is such a special place.   When I arrived I took a deep breath of this crisp New England air and thought, “Wow, I’m in the state that’s next to the state where Ben and Jerry’s ice cream is made.”  

But don’t get me wrong, I take my task today very seriously.  When I got the call 2 months ago to be your speaker, I decided to prepare with the same intensity many of you have devoted to an important term paper.  So late last night, I began.  I drank two cans of Red Bull, snorted some Adderall, played a few hours of Call of Duty, and then opened my browser.  I think Wikipedia put it best when they said “Dartmouth college is a private Ivy League University in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States.”  Thank you and good luck.   

To communicate with you students today, I have gone to great lengths to become well-versed in your unique linquistic patterns.  In fact, just this morning I left Baker Berry with my tripee Barry to eat a Billy Bob at the Bema when my flitz to Francesca was Blitz jacked by some d-bag on his FSP.    

Yes, I’ve done my research.  This college was named after the Second Earl of Dartmouth, a good friend of the Third Earl of UC Santa Cruz and the Duke of the Barbazon School of Beauty.  Your school motto is “Vox Clamantis in Deserto,” which means “Voice Crying Out in the Wilderness.”  This is easily the most pathetic school motto I have ever heard.  Apparently, it narrowly beat out “Silently Weeping in Thick Shrub” and “Wimpering in Moist Leaves without Pants.”   Your school color is green, and this color was chosen by Frederick Mather in 1867 because, and this is true, “it was the only color that had not been taken already.” I cannot remember hearing anything so sad.  Dartmouth, you have an inferiority complex, and you should not. You have graduated more great fictitious Americans than any other college.  Meredith Grey of Grey’s Anatomy.  Pete Campbell from Mad Men.  Michael Corleone from The Godfather.  In fact, I look forward to next years’ Valedictory Address by your esteemed classmate, Count Chocula.  Of course, your greatest fictitious graduate is Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner.  Man, imagine if a real Treasury Secretary made those kinds of decisions.   Oh, I know.  You’re going to say “We’ve got Dr. Seuss.” Well guess what, we’re all tired of hearing about Dr. Seuss.   Face it: The man rhymed fafloozle with saznoozle.  In the literary community, that’s called cheating.  

Your insecurity is so great, Dartmouth, that you don’t even think you deserve a real podium.  What the hell is this thing?  It looks like you stole it from the set of Survivor: Nova Scotia.  Seriously, it looks like something a bear would use at an AA meeting.   

No, Dartmouth, you must stand tall.  Raise your heads high and feel proud.  

Because if Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are your self-involved, vain, name-dropping older brothers, you are the cool, sexually confident, Lacrosse playing younger sibling who knows how to throw a party and looks good in a down vest.  Brown, of course, is your lesbian sister who never leaves her room.  And Penn, Columbia, and Cornell …..well, frankly, who gives a shit.

Yes, I’ve always had a special bond with this school.  In fact, this is my second time coming here.   When I was 17 years old and touring colleges, way back in the fall of 1980, I came to Dartmouth.  Dartmouth was a very different place back then.  I made the trip up from Boston on a mule and, after asking the blacksmith in West Leb for directions, I came to this beautiful campus.  No dormitories had been built yet, so I stayed with a family of fur traders in White River junction.  It snowed heavily during my visit and I was trapped here for four months.  I was forced to eat the mule, who a week earlier had been forced to eat the fur traders.  Still, I loved Dartmouth and I vowed to return.

But fate dealt a heavy blow.   With no money, I was forced to enroll in a small, local commuter school, a pulsating sore on a muddy elbow of the Charles River.  I was a miserable wretch, and to this day I cannot help but wonder:  What if I had gone to Dartmouth?

If I had gone to Dartmouth, I might have spent at least some of my college years outside and today I might not be allergic to all plant life, as well as most types of rock.

If I had gone to Dartmouth, right now I’d be wearing a fleece thong instead of a lace thong.

If I had gone to Dartmouth, I still wouldn’t know the second verse to “Dear Old Dartmouth.”  Face it, none of you do; you all mumble that part.

If I had gone to Dartmouth, I’d have a liver the size and consistency of a bean bag chair. 

Finally, if I had gone to Dartmouth, today I’d be getting an honorary degree at Harvard.  Imagine how awesome that would be.

You are a great school, and you deserve a historic commencement address.   That’s right, I want my message today to be forever remembered because it changed the world.   To do this, I must suggest groundbreaking policy. Winston Churchill gave his famous “Iron Curtain” speech at Westminster College in 1946.  JFK outlined his nuclear disarmament policy at American University in 1963.  And today, I would like to set forth my own policy here at Dartmouth: I call it The Conan Doctrine.  Under The Conan Doctrine:

All bachelor degrees will be upgraded to masters degrees, all masters degrees will be upgraded to PhD’s, and all MBA students will be immediately transferred to a white collar prison.
Winter Carnival will become Winter Carnivale and be moved to Rio.  Clothing will be optional and all expenses will be paid by the Alumni Association.
Your nickname, the Big Green, will be changed to something more kick-ass like “The Jade Blade,” the “Seafoam Avenger” or simply “Lime-Zilla.”
The D-Plan and “quarter system” will finally be updated to “the one sixty-fourth system.”  Semesters will last 3 days and students will be encouraged to take 48 semesters off.  They must, however, be on campus during their Sophomore 4th of July.
I will re-instate Tubestock.  And I will punish those who tried to replace it with Fieldstock.  Rafting and beer are a much better combination than a field and a beer.  I happen to know that in two years, they were going to downgrade Fieldstock to Deskstock ---  7 hours of fun sitting quietly at your desk.  Don’t let those bastards do it!
And finally, under the Conan doctrine, all commencement speakers who shamelessly pander with cheap, inside references designed to get childish applause, will be forced to apologize…..TO THE GREATEST GRADUATING CLASS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.   DARTMOUTH CLASS OF 2011 RULES!!!

Besides policy, another hallmark of great commencement speeches is deep, profound advice like “reach for the stars.”  Well today, I am not going to waste your time with empty clichés.  Instead, I am going to give you real, practical advice that you will need to know if you are going to survive the next few years.   

First, adult acne lasts longer than you think.  I almost cancelled 2 days ago because I had a zit on my eye.
Guys:  this is important -- you cannot iron a shirt while wearing it
If you live on Ramen Noodles for too long, you lose all feeling in your hands and your stool becomes a white gel.  
And finally, wearing colorful Converse high-tops beneath your graduation robe is a great way to tell your classmates that this is just the first of many horrible decisions you plan to make with your life.
Of course there are many parents here and I have real advice for them as well.  Parents, write this down:

Many of you haven’t seen your children in four years.  Now you are about to see them every day when they come out of the basement to tell you the WiFi isn’t working.
If your child majored in Fine Arts or Philosophy, you have good reason to be worried.  The only place where they are really now qualified to get a job is ancient Greece.
The traffic today on East Wheelock is going to be murder, so once they start handing out diplomas, you should slip out in the middle of the K’s.
You will spend more money framing your child’s diploma than they will earn in the next six months.  It’s tough out there, so be patient.  The only people hiring right now are Panera Bread and Mexican drug cartels.  
Yes, you parents must be patient because it is indeed a grim job market out there.  And one of the reasons that it’s so tough finding work is that aging baby boomers refuse to leave their jobs..  Trust me on this.  Even when they promise you for five years that they are going to leave….and say it on television --- I mean you can go on YouTube right now and watch the guy do it…there is no guarantee they won’t come back.   Of course I’m speaking generally.

But enough.  This is not a time for grim prognostications or negativity.  No, I came here today because, believe it or not, I actually do have something real to tell you.

Eleven years ago I gave an address to a graduating class at Harvard.  I have not spoken at a graduation since because I thought I had nothing left to say.  But then 2010 came.   And now I’m here, three thousand miles from my home, because I learned a hard but profound lesson last year and I’d like to share it with you.   In 2000, I told graduates “Don’t be afraid to fail.”  Well now I’m here to tell you that, though you should not fear failure, you should do your very best to avoid it.   Nietzsche famously said “Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”  But what he failed to stress is that IT ALMOST KILLS YOU.  Disappointment stings and, for driven, successful people like yourselves it is disorienting.  What Nietzsche should have said is  “Whatever doesn’t kill you, makes you watch a lot of Cartoon Network and drink mid-price Chardonnay at 11 in the morning. “ 

By definition, Commencement speakers at an Ivy League college are considered successful.  But a little over a year ago, I experienced a profound and very public disappointment.  I did not get what I wanted, and I left a system that had nurtured and help define me for the better part of seventeen years.  I went from being in the center of the grid to not only off the grid, but underneath the coffee table that the grid sits on, lost in the shag carpeting that is underneath the coffee table supporting the grid.  It was the making of a career disaster, and a terrible analogy.

But then something spectacular happened.  Fogbound, with no compass, and adrift, I started trying things.  I grew a strange, cinnamon beard.  I dove into the world of social media and started tweeting my comedy.  I threw together a national tour.  I played the guitar, did stand-up, wore a skin-tight blue leather suit, recorded an album, made a documentary, and frightened my friends and family.   Ultimately, I abandoned all preconceived perceptions of my career path and stature and took a job on basic cable with a network most famous for showing re-runs, along with sitcoms created by a tall, black man who dresses like an old, black woman.  I did a lot of silly, unconventional, spontaneous and seemingly irrational things and guess what ---- with the exception of the blue leather suit, it was the most satisfying and fascinating year of my professional life.  To this day I still don’t understand exactly what happened, but I have never had more fun, been more challenged, and this is important ---- had more conviction about what I was doing.

How could this be true?  It’s simple: there are few things more liberating in this life than having your worst fear realized.  I went to college with many people who prided themselves on knowing exactly who they were and exactly where they were going.  At Harvard, five different guys told me that they would one day be President of the Unites States.  Four of them were later killed in motel shoot-outs.   The other one briefly hosted “Blues Clues,” before dying senselessly in yet another motel shoot-out.   Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42.  One’s dream is constantly evolving, rising and falling, changing course.  This happens in every job, but because I have worked in comedy for twenty five years, I can speak best about my own profession.

Way back in the 1940’s there was a very funny man named Jack Benny.  He was a giant star and easily one of the greatest comedians of his generation.  And a much younger man named Johnny Carson wanted very much to be Jack Benny.  In some ways he was, but in many ways he wasn’t.  He emulated Jack Benny, but his own quirks and mannerisms, along with a changing medium, pulled him in a different direction.  And yet his failure to completely become his hero made him the funniest person of his generation.  David Letterman wanted to be Johnny Carson, and was not, and as a result my generation of comedians wanted to be David Letterman.   And none of us are --- my peers and I have all missed that mark in a thousand different ways.  But the point is this: It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.  It’s not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can be a catalyst for profound re-invention.

So, at the age of 47, after 25 years of obsessively pursuing my dream, that dream changed.  For decades, in show business, the ultimate goal of every comedian was to host The Tonight Show.  It was the Holy Grail, and like many people I thought that achieving that goal would define me as successful.   But that is not true.  No specific job or career goal defines me and it should not define you.  In 2000, I told graduates to not be afraid to fail, and I still believe that.  But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come.  The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.

Many of you here today are getting your diploma at this Ivy League school because you have committed yourself to a dream and worked hard to achieve it.  And there is no greater cliché in a commencement address than “follow your dream.”  Well I am here to tell you that whatever you think your dream is now, it will probably change.  And that’s okay.  Four years ago, many of you had a specific vision of what your college experience was going to be and who you were going to become.  And I bet, today, most of you would admit that your time here was very different from what you imagined.  Your roommates changed, your major changed, for some of you your sexual orientation changed.   I bet some of you have changed your sexual orientation since I began this speech.  I know I have.  But through the good and especially the bad, the person you are now is someone you could never have conjured in the fall of 2007.

I have told you many things today, most of it foolish but some of it true.  I’d like to end my address by breaking a taboo and quoting myself from 17 months ago.  At the end of my final program with NBC, just before signing off, I said “Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. “ Today, receiving this honor and speaking to the Dartmouth Class of 2011 from behind a tree-trunk, I have never believed that more.

Thank you very much, and congratulations.

I am deeply honored to be here with you all. I bring you special greetings from the Class of 1960. President Higdon, members of the Board of Trustees, my faculty colleagues, the wonderful staff of the college, the families of the graduates, and friends, and especially, the Class of 2011, it is a deep privilege to be here with you.

I was here early this morning – very early this morning – for an exceptional presentation, and really, for me, an exceptional, eye-opening and mind-expanding event, which meant I was at Connecticut College. I was with the students in Professor Tristan Borer’s class. They had done the research and then took the voices of diverse women around the world who together create what we might call world politics. But these are not women that you usually read about; they certainly aren’t women whose voices are usually heard; they never get the microphone. And yet the students, the very smart, engaged, thoughtful, committed students in Tristan Borer’s class, many of them right here in the graduating class – as well as juniors as well – managed to think deeply, think with nuance, and be creative. They managed to connect with women they didn’t know; they managed to connect with women whom they knew were part of their world.

Making connections is oftentimes talked about as if it’s reassuring. If you feel reassured, if you feel comfortable, you probably haven’t really made a connection. A connection should probably make you feel a little uneasy. Because if you make a connection it means you’re beginning to take responsibility for that person’s life. It means that that person is somehow affecting your life, but you’re also affecting their life.

I was thinking about connections a lot when I thought about our connection – everybody here, whether you’re a graduating senior, or you’re an alum, or you’re a family member, or if you’re a member of the Board of Trustees – everybody here is connected with the pioneering women and men from Hartford and New London who created this amazing institution. And I began thinking about them, and I began thinking about the month in which Connecticut College was formally chartered by the legislature of the state of Connecticut; that would have been April 1911. 

Now, probably some of you – especially if you’re from New York City, or maybe you just watch American Experience on PBS, or maybe you’re interested in labor history – some of you know that 1911 was a year of eventfulness; not all of it happy. Two weeks before Connecticut College received its official founding charter on March 25, 1911, it was a sunny day; it was kind of early spring in New York City, on the Lower East Side. In fact it was so warm on March 25, 1911, that a lot of people decided that they would come out and picnic in Washington Square, down in Greenwich Village. But the weekend had not yet been invented. You know, the weekend is an invention. The weekend is an invention of the labor movement. You’ve seen the bumper stickers, “If you’re enjoying your weekend, thank the labor movement.” Well, the weekend had not yet been invented in 1911. So, just a street away hundreds of workers were at work that sunny Saturday in March 1911, at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Now the shirtwaist had become very fashionable. It was a blouse that looked modern; it could be tucked into a long skirt, but a skirt that was daringly just above the ankle. And this really became – the shirtwaist with its long skirt – became for many women their ticket to modernity. Because if you wore the shirtwaist, this handsome white blouse in many styles, tucked into a not terribly long skirt, it meant you could move around the city. It meant that you could take a job and you could get paid for the work you did (That’s a radical idea for women, “Did you get paid for the work you do?”) and it was worn by women of all classes in 1911, and in fact, I just saw a photograph of women working at the Triangle Shirt Factory, and many of them who were sewing those shirtwaist white blouses, were in fact, wearing them. And then I also saw the wonderful calendar commemorating 1911, which is the calendar of 2011 for Connecticut College, and it showed President Sykes and the Secretary of the College with the first thirteen faculty members – seven women and six men – and I counted at least four shirtwaists being worn for this formal photograph – because these were modern women; these were women who dared to think that they might be professors. What a daring thing to think when state legislatures and members of Congress said that you weren’t rational enough to cast a vote, and yet you are daring to think that you could be a faculty member, armed with yourshirtwaist.

So, there they were, these hundreds of men and women in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. The factory was – the building – was ten stories high. Triangle was the biggest shirt maker in the country at the time – shirtwaist maker. It would be the Nike of today, and Triangle had the top three floors, the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth floor. And the women there spoke multiple languages; most of them, as are garment workers today in North America, most of them were relatively new immigrants, so the languages that they spoke to each other – at least when the supervisor wasn’t around telling them not to talk – were Yiddish, Irish, Polish, Italian. They were looking forward to their one day off, Sunday. They were looking forward to their paychecks, which would have been five dollars for a fifty-hour week. Not five dollars an hour; five dollars for a fifty-hour week. And then somebody on the eighth floor – we now know because we have wonderful historians doing this work – somebody carelessly tossed a cigarette that wasn’t fully extinguished into a wastebasket on the eighth floor.

There were very few rules about safety conditions in any kind of factory in the United States in 1911, so there were mounds of cloth; there were piles of paper from patterns stacked all around the factory floor. The fire spread. It spread so fast. People down in the park said later they looked up from their picnics and all of a sudden they saw smoke billowing out of the top floors of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. The women and men who worked on the eighth floor managed to get down the stairways. The people who worked, including the owners, up on the tenth floor, managed to scramble up to the roof and then to jump to a nearby building’s roof and to escape. But the women and men on the ninth floor went to their doors and they found that the managers had locked them. They’d locked them because the managers presumed that workers were thieves and were probably trying to steal cloth out of the factory. A hundred and forty-six Triangle Shirtwaist Factory employees died from that fire on March 25, 1911: twenty-three men and a hundred and twenty-three women. Many of them died as they tried to jump out of the ninth-story windows in desperation when they realized the doors were locked and the flames were spreading.

Now, up here in New London and in Hartford and many of the towns you come from, there were headlines. This was the worst industrial fire, so far, in American industrial history. There were headlines and they were read here, probably in the New London Day, and women who wore work shirtwaists began to think “Well, where do they come from? At what risk was my fashionable, functional, shirtwaist making me a modern woman? Who made that? At what risk?” There’ve always been connections between labor and education, between gender and class, but actually thinking about the connections, and thinking about our own connectedness, should make us uneasy because it brings a sense of responsibility.

This morning – it was very early – but I thought I should do a little research and my research was looking at the labels on my own clothes for today. My robe, it turns out, was made in Canada. My guess is it was made by new immigrant women, who would be Somali women, Filipino women, in Canada, probably in Winnipeg, or on Spadina Street, if any of you know Toronto. My other clothes today were made in Portugal – or let’s put it more directly – were made by workers who are Portuguese, workers in the Dominican Republic, and workers in Honduras.

My guess is that when you take off your robes and change your clothes – so you can clean out your rooms – you take a look at your labels, and my guess is here today we are connected with Chinese garment workers, with Vietnamese sneaker workers, with garment workers and textile workers in Mexico, Bangladesh, Romania, Cambodia. But being connected means that we have to take action. The first action is to be curious; to never put on a piece of clothing without curiosity, without thinking, “What kind of risks are the people taking so that I can have an affordable shirt? What kinds of doors are locked in the factories that make my sneakers or my fashionable sandals?”

So, to all of you who are graduating today, may you thrive. May every one of you thrive, and you’re going to thrive in many different ways. But may you thrive in a way that enhances the justice, and the safety, and the dignity of every person who has made the clothes that you are wearing today.

Thank you

Before I start, some of you may not have graduated from college before and you may not know the etiquette. It’s customary when you come up to get your degree to give the president a little tip. Ten or 20 bucks just to show he did a good job.

It’s also customary to give the commencement speaker a little something, no more than 15 or 20 percent of your annual tuition. Though I do take credit cards and I offer discounts for philosophy majors. This money is not for me. It’s going straight to the Wayne Graham for President campaign. This country has a yawning leadership gap that only Coach Graham can fill.

Even if you don’t give, I want you to know how great it is to be here on this happy occasion. The parents are happy to have produced such outstanding young men and women. The faculty is happy to have produced such outstanding graduates, despite everything their parents tried to do to them. The administrators are happy to have such an outstanding alumni, despite everything the faculty tried to do to them. The students are happy they have turned out so well, despite what the blowhards in all these categories tried to do to them.

Well, Class of 2011, I am the final blowhard. I am the last windbag between you and your degree.

So this is indeed a happy occasion.

Over the past few years, we’ve learned a lot about happiness. We’ve learned that the relationship between money and happiness is weak. Once you hit the middle class, getting richer doesn’t make you that much happier. The relationship between friendship and happiness is strong. Joining a club that meets just once a month produces the same happiness gain as doubling your income. Getting married produces the same happiness gain as earning an extra $100,000 a year. The daily activity that contributes most to happiness is having dinner with friends. The daily activity that detracts most from happiness is commuting.

Some philosophers distinguish between four types of happiness. The first kind is hedonism — indulging in the sensual pleasures. It is fashionable to look down on this kind of happiness. But judging from your bleary and bloodshot eyes this morning, you do not look down in hedonism. And you are absolutely right. I can tell you that every 50-year-old within the sound of my voice secretly wishes they had done more partying while in college.

The second type of happiness involves having money, beauty and status. It is an oddity of our culture that most of our collective fantasies seem to revolve most around this kind of happiness. If you look at the ads in glossy magazines, they all celebrate this kind of happiness.

I have an odd fascination with people who try to live out the lifestyles described in these ads. You see them in rich resort communities and fancy suburbs across America. These people are often incredibly attractive and effortlessly slender. When you look at them you realize they don’t really have thighs. Each leg is just one slender calf on top of another.

You see these incredibly attractive families and realize they have achieved a genetic miracle. Their grandmothers all looked like Gertrude Stein, but after marrying a succession of beautiful spouses, their granddaughters all look like Halle Berry.

I could tell you that when you have trouble making up your mind about something, tell yourself you’ll settle it by flipping a coin. But don’t go by how the coin flips; go by your emotional reaction to the coin flip. Are you happy or sad it came up heads or tails?


Sometimes you’ll see them dashing through private airports carrying tote bags, because when you have your own plane you don’t need luggage that actually closes. You’ll notice that it’s apparently become fashionable in the world of the super-rich to have dogs a third as tall as the ceiling heights, because they are often accompanied by these gigantic hounds that look like furry velociraptors and are named after Jane Austen characters. The moms are so fit from yoga they actually weigh less than their own children. They were in the delivery room cutting the umbilical cord themselves and flashing mandarin flashcards at their little newborns, getting them ready for the college admissions process.

The most amazing thing is the dads don’t get sick and die when they get old; they just take up surfing and extreme sports. After retirement they’re out on the snowboard slopes popping Cialis like breath mints, and by the time they’re 90 they are sprinting up Mount Everest. By this time they’ve shrunk down to 90 pounds of muscle and gristle. They’re covered in Spandex. They look like little iron Raisinets zooming up the mountain. I don’t know why our culture spends so much time celebrating this level of happiness, but it does.

But you, as graduates of Rice University, will not be satisfied with this layer. The third level of happiness has to do with friendships and relations. I once interviewed a man who spent his life studying happiness and he came back with this result: Happiness is love. Full stop. Middle-aged guys like me are not good at talking about love and relationships. My wife says that me pretending to be an expert on emotion is like Ghandi pretending to be an expert on gluttony. But the fact is, the surest way to measure whether a person is happy, healthy and well is to ask: How deeply is that person enmeshed in deep passionate commitments? You can be enmeshed with family and friends. You can be enmeshed with your community and co-workers. You can be enmeshed with great poets or artists. But you have to be enmeshed. Happiness at this level is a group project. It doesn’t come from inside. It comes from outside.

But most of us would say there is an even higher and rarer level of happiness. It goes by many names: excellence, meaning and fulfillment. It involves doing things that are painful, not pleasurable. It involves doing things that sometimes costs you friends. It involves achieving some large thing for the world. I’d like to spend the remainder of my time describing two different routes to this kind of profound and fulfilling happiness.

The first route to this kind of excellence was best described by a man named Clay Christensen in a fine commencement talk at Harvard University. When he graduated from college, Christensen decided that his most important immediate task was to find a purpose for his life. He was enrolled at a program at Oxford but he took off an hour each day studying, praying and thinking about his purpose. The program was very demanding, but each evening, no matter what, he took an hour off from his work to find his purpose.

He calls that enterprise the single most useful thing he’s ever done. Since he defined his purpose, he has allocated his time and energy in order to serve it. If you don’t have a purpose, you are sailing without a guiding star, he says. You’ll just wander aimlessly. You’ll spend too much time on things that give you an immediate sense of accomplishment, like completing a project at work, and neglect the deeper challenges that take longer to realize, like raising honorable children.

When Christensen describes his method, he sounds like the business strategist he is: First, identify a goal. Then devise a strategy. Then find the right metrics to measure your progress. Then execute your plan. I’ve been reading Christensen for years and recently I had a chance to meet him. I found him immensely honorable and inspiring. And yet I confess I’ve never been able to follow his method. I was not able at age 20 or 25 to sit down and think, pray and research and find a purpose for my life. In fact, I don’t think most of us are able to achieve this hard task in this way. I do not believe most of us are able, as we set out in life, to understand the circumstances in which our life will be lived. The world is too dynamic, unpredictable and unknowable.

Furthermore, I do not believe most of us are able, as we set out in life, to understand ourselves. The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and each of those neurons can have 10,000 or 15,000 connections. That mind-boggling complexity is the physical embodiment of the mind-boggling complexity that is ourselves. I don’t think we can ever see into the deepest wellsprings of our action, in youth or even at any age.

Finally, and I don’t know if I can express this adequately, but I don’t believe that we fully exist until our story is well under way. That is, I don’t believe we are people who then form relationships and set off on journeys through life. I think the journeys and the relationships come first and our personhood emerges slowly over decades out of them. So I respect Christensen’s route to fulfillment. He graduated from college and asked, What is the purpose of my life? What do I want from life? And then he oriented his life around the answers he came up with.

But I suspect many people can’t follow that path. And so I’d like to describe a second route to fulfillment. In this route, we don’t chart a life. We are summoned by life. We don’t ask, What do I want from life? Instead, we ask, What does my life ask of me? What is life summoning me to do? I didn’t make up this question. I found it in a very famous book by Viktor Frankl called “Man’s Search for Meaning.”

Frankl grew up in Europe and as a young student was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. This is obviously not the life he would have chosen for himself. But he found that this life presented him with certain problems he never would have experienced if he had not been imprisoned. Life called him to study human psychology in moments of extreme suffering. Life called on him to preserve his love for humanity in circumstances that made it extremely difficult.

Life, he decided, means taking responsibility for the tasks and problems that are put before us. As he wrote, “Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs.”

I hope and trust that none of you will be confronted with a task as horrific as a concentration camp. But tasks will arise. According to Frankl’s method, the question is this: Do you recognize the tasks in front of you and are you willing to dive into them?

To illustrate the point in more relevant terms, let me try to describe an experience that many of you are going to have over the next few years. You are going to spend the next 10 years wandering around American society.

People who graduated from college a generation ago usually did four things in rapid succession. They got their degree, they found a job, they got married and they bought a home. In 1960 the vast majority of college grads had done these three things by age 30. Now the situation is very different. Most people have not done these three things by age 30.

Today you get your degree, but if you are like most college grads, you will spend the next decade of your lives moving from city to city, school to school and from job to job experimenting with different careers and lifestyles. While you do this, by the way, your parents will go quietly insane.

But you are right to spend your twenties engaged in this sort of Odyssey. Because as you do, you will put yourself in the path of many problems and tasks that you can’t imagine today. Life will ask of you many things. You will probably fall in love. This won’t be an abstract proposition. It will be with a real live person, with a name, a face, unwanted odors and body hair. You will probably not even consciously choose to fall in love with this person. The love will just sort of well up inside and take over. You will confront this problem: Is this the person I want to marry?

This is the most important decision you will face in your life. If you have a great career and a bad marriage, you will be miserable. If you have a great marriage and a bad career you will be joyful.

I tell every college president I can that they should compel every student to major in marriage. Students should be compelled to take courses in the psychology of marriage, the literature of marriage, the neuroscience of marriage, the history of marriage. Nobody listens to me, so in your twenties you will have to assign yourself your own curriculum. You will have to prepare yourself so you can live up to this enormous task.

Life will ask you other questions. Some of you will find yourself in a poorly managed office. Life will ask, Can you lead and inspire people better than that jerk? Some of you will have a relative with Alzheimer’s. Life will ask: Can you help cure this disease? Some of you will find yourselves in neighborhoods where people drop out of high school, generation after generation. Life will ask, Can you help break this cycle of poverty? In other words, you fill find tasks all around. Sometimes these tasks will be thrown unexpectedly into your face. Sometimes they will be tasks you never imagined or sought.

If you will forgive a moment of autobiography, all my life I dreamed of working at a magazine. I love writing long magazine articles. That’s the sort of journalism I love best, and for many years I did that.

But several years ago I was offered a column with the New York Times. A column is 800 words twice a week. Imagine you have a paper due in three days and imagine that’s the rest of your life.

My first instinct was to turn the job down. But unexpectedly, life asked this of me. The New York Times is an incredible platform and a great newspaper. And not to be egotistical, but I thought I could represent a centerright point of view that doesn’t have many pundits on its side. I thought I could add a calm voice to an often overheated national debate. So I took the job.

I find the job hard and stressful. I don’t enjoy it as much as I did writing for magazines. But I’m very glad I took up the task life put before me. My enjoyment is worse but my satisfaction is better.

I feel bad about this little talk. I haven’t given you much in the way of concrete practical advice. I could tell you that when you are thinking of marrying someone, one thing you should do is sneak up and startle them. The startle response is a very accurate predictor of that person’s underlying temperament. I could tell you that when you have trouble making up your mind about something, tell yourself you’ll settle it by flipping a coin. But don’t go by how the coin flips; go by your emotional reaction to the coin flip. Are you happy or sad it came up heads or tails? That is your deepest self telling you what it wants.

No, this hasn’t been a very practical talk. But I have tried to describe two ways of thinking about life. Clay Christensen had his way of organizing his life. It worked for him and it will probably work for some of you. Viktor Frankl had his way of conceptualizing life. It emphasizes that we are not primarily questioning life, we are questioned by life. We are summoned by the concrete realities around us.

The message of the summoned life is that you don’t need to panic if you don’t yet know what you want to do with your life. But you probably want to throw yourselves into circumstances where the summons will come. It’s probably a good idea to spend a lot of time asking, What are these circumstances asking me to do? What is needed in this place? The crucial tests are likely to be, Have you done enough reading and thinking so you are aware of the summons around you? Do you have the capacities to complete these tasks?

As graduates of a place like Rice, I suspect you have been prepared and you do have these capacities.

But one there’s one final question: Do you have the ability to throw yourself against the currents of our culture and recognize that you are not the center of your life? The tasks and summonses are the center. Your happiness and your worth are a byproduct of how you engage them. Most of us are egotistical and most of us are self-concerned most of the time, but it’s nonetheless true that life comes to a point only when the self dissolves into some larger task and summons. The purpose in life is not to find yourself. It’s to lose yourself.

Thanks for your attention.

Welcome to the graduates, the students, their parents, the teachers, and other guests.  And thank you President Huddleston for this wonderful honorary degree.   

Being here today is a singular honor for me because it is two days shy of 35 years ago when I was sitting where you are today.  Wondering how my life would unfold.  Glad to be done with school and excited and apprehensive about the future.  In a poignant reminder of how sweet life can be, my Mom, my oldest son Ryan, and many of my family were in the audience 35 years ago and they are in the audience today… now accompanied by my youngest son, John.  Pretty darned cool.

There is a certain irony in the receipt of this honor though, given that it took me six years to complete a four year degree and that in my Sophomore year I was asked by the Assistant Dean of Students to no longer live on campus because while there was no particularly telling  event, she didn’t like that I was what she termed “a general troublemaker.”

Many Commencement speakers address a topic of global significance, however, given email input from many of you, it seemed more useful to provide a perspective on how I went from being in the audience 35 years ago to being up here today.  Of the 186 student emails received, 119 requested some form of life advice and the remaining 67 provided me with all different kinds of advice with my favorite being those explaining money was unimportant.  While I agree money is not the only thing, I’d also say that those of you expressing that opinion… clearly do not have kids yet.  And if you still don’t understand, I’m certain your parents can explain it to you.   

To begin, it might be useful to tell you a bit about that six-year college stretch, my career in general, and the things I think I learned along the way.

Not having a clear sense of what I wanted to do after graduation from high school in New Hampshire, even though I’d been accepted at UNH, I took the $100 won as a high school scholarship plus some money set aside, bought a $395 seven- year-old car and told my parents I wasn’t going to college.  I worked with my Dad as a mechanic for a few months then drove off to Michigan.  Spent a few months working there as a mechanic, a carpenter’s apprentice, and doing odd jobs before realizing, after a year of trying, that I had zero aptitude for manual labor.

Drove back to New Hampshire in June and applied for a six-year tour in the US Navy on a nuclear submarine.  Passed all tests but my friends started the verbal pummeling with “Six years under water… you’ll go crazy.”  Decided they were right and the day before swearing in called the recruiting officer, and after assurances he couldn’t send the cops after me, told him I wasn’t coming.

In July, at loose ends, and having been told that it was too late to apply to UNH for September admission, I took a drive to Durham, found the office for the Director of Admissions, Gene Savage, and refused to leave until he saw me.  After a couple of hours of waiting, Gene agreed to see me. I told my story and he agreed to let me in that September if I would immediately complete an application and send it to him personally.  I did and he let me in… a very nice guy!

After two years in school, but tired of never having any money, I went to work as an hourly employee full-time on the night shift at a factory making jet engine parts while also continuing full- time at UNH during the day.  After a few months of that and mid-way through my junior year, decided with a buddy that the path to true riches was in commercial fishing!  An early insight into my business acumen!

During that second semester, I earned a 1.8… I was happy I passed and my Mom was disgusted.  I quit school again while keeping the job working nights, we bought a 33 foot fishing boat and spent the next few months fishing off the coast of Maine… barely breaking even.  My buddy got married, and his wife having more sense than the two of us, encouraged him to quit… so we sold the boat.

Shortly thereafter, I got married, had my son Ryan 10 months later, and got the responsibility wits scared out of me.  That night job would never pay for all of this.  I needed to become responsible. Returned to school days, continued working nights, and finally graduated with my degree six years after first starting.  Having spent the last two and a half years as an hourly employee but now armed with a degree, I got a job in GE management, hoping some day I could just make $20,000 a year so I could support my family.  Had a daughter, got divorced, got married again, and had my son John.

Spent the next 23 years focusing on GE as a career, progressing through financial and general management roles in businesses like Plastics, Jet Engines, and Consumer Electronics, and culminating as President and CEO of the Major Appliances business.  In 1999, joined TRW, a $17 billion Cleveland company and became CEO. I joined Honeywell in 2002 and became CEO.

Since that time, we have taken Honeywell from a $23 billion company that lost money two years in a row to a $37 billion global success story with 130,000 employees.  We consistently generate strong sales, earnings, and cash flow and we are decidedly more global.  The share price has also grown commensurately and one analyst referred to
us as the “It Stock for 2011.” Now I’ve enjoyed telling you my story.  Most people after all, do enjoy talking about themselves.   But how does all of this relate to you?

Hopefully, you can benefit from some of my lessons learned.  God knows my two sons sitting in the audience today have had to hear enough about it.  But please remember it’s not a prescription… its advice… and it may be worth exactly what you’re paying for it!

So after a tumultuous beginning and a thus far successful 35-year career with various successes and failures along the way, what do I think I’ve learned?  It can be condensed into four major areas.

First… Recognize the Importance of People and Your Own Behaviors.  Be Self-Aware.

Be honest with yourself and face reality.  Know who you are.  In your personal characteristics, what are your strengths and what are the areas where you’re not so strong?  You can’t be good at everything so how can you fill in where you aren’t?   When you are younger this is one of the toughest things to do.  We are all born with different skills and aptitudes.  I was fortunate to be born at a time when my skill with a pencil was valuable.  A hundred years ago I’d probably just have been a bad farmer.  That’s not something you can control.   What you can control are your behaviors, how you look at life, and how you maximize the skills you do have.  Be aware of your impact on people around you.  Do people feel better as a result of spending time with you?  During the course of your career your biggest accomplishments will be achieved by motivating and inspiring others.  

Develop personal credibility in your dealings. “Do what you say” is not an empty phrase.  Stand for something and have values. Be open to new ideas… have opinions and state them but be willing to modify them for a better suggestion… acknowledge  the contribution of others even if it’s painful… it reflects on you. Recognize because someone disagrees, you don’t want to make it personal.  At the same time, not everyone you deal with is reasonable.  There truly are zealots in the world who can see only their point of view.  These people are the most dangerous and can be found in all walks of life.  Be tolerant.   

If a decision doesn’t seem right… change it!   Better the embarrassment of a changed mind than the lifetime penance of a bad decision!  In business
and in life. Be prepared to take hits to your ego whether deserved or not.  My Dad was a very proud man who could have quite a temper.  He owned a service station and one day when working with him when I was about 14 I watched him take an unwarranted verbal beating from a customer.  I was shocked because there was no response.  When the customer left, he came back and sat next to me on the curb and said “Dave, sometimes in business and in life you have to put your pride in your back pocket.”  Don’t let anyone break you down emotionally, be able to take that hit… they will happen.

Second… Get Out of Your Comfort Zone… Better Yet Get Comfortable About Being Out of Your
Comfort Zone!  Be a Learner! The greatest learning occurs where you’re uncomfortable because you don’t know it all.  Push yourself.  Be willing to take a chance, take a risk with something new… career, hobbies, dating, sports, whatever.  It doesn’t mean you should be impulsive.  It does mean that you should take calculated risks.  Get yourself into the arena… be a participant and not a spectator.  Don’t always wait for approval or perfect knowledge.  Do something.

Have the confidence in yourself to take that chance.  If you don’t, certainly others won’t.  And there will always be plenty of people to tell you why it won’t work, including some friends and family.   And sometimes they’ll be right… and that’s painful.

As my Mom always said, “Think for yourself.  Just because everyone is doing something, it doesn’t mean its right.” Which also means you have to be able to handle rejection and failure.  Successful people have failures… sometimes spectacularly embarrassing ones… but they learn from it and move on to the next success.  Several times during the last 35 years, I’ve thought my career or personal life was over.  It is… only if you let it.  Picking yourself up after a significant defeat or failure is really, really hard… and it’s really, really essential.   Don’t let people minimize your goals or your successes… learn instead from what they’re saying.  There may be a bit of truth in it that can help you.   Don’t be discouraged by failure or rejection… learn from it!

Life will happen to you, whether you try to guide it or not, so you might as well try to influence the outcome. You have to know what you want and you have to be willing to go after it! 

Third… Be Results Oriented, Have Goals, And Recognize That Hard Work Does Not Always Pay Off The biggest learning from the fishing boat experience was that “Hard Work Does Not Always Pay Off!”  If you’re working on the wrong thing, it doesn’t matter how hard you work, nothing will ever come of it.  Don’t get me wrong.  Hard work is important.   Just make sure you’re working on the right thing.  If you want to get ahead, you actually have to accomplish something.  If you work 100 hours a week and nothing happened, then there is no story.  The person who says “but I worked really hard,” still has nothing to show for it.  Harsh perhaps, but very true regardless of the endeavor.

I’ve also always liked this definition of insanity… “Doing the same thing over and over again, always expecting a different result.”  If you’re not getting the results you wanted or expected, you have to change something.

In setting your goals, recognize that it is always about trying to achieve two seemingly conflicting things at the same time.  While confusing perhaps in concept, each of you will face its consequences For example, do you want a great career or do you want a great family life?  If you run an organization, do you want people empowered so those closest to the action can make decisions quickly or do you want good controls so nothing bad happens?  If you run a company, do you want good short-term or do
you want good long-term results?  In every case, you want both… and the way to get both is to recognize the conundrum, understand where processes can be improved so you get both, and make decisions where trade-offs are needed.  It’s not an easy concept to understand, but it is real and you will face it.

Being smart is not enough to achieve results.  Plenty of smart people get beaten by others who are more hungry, take calculated risks, work harder, have better people skills, can execute better, or have more common sense.  Recognize what you need in that total package to succeed.   

Before making any decision, get the facts as best you can.  Don’t just react based on what newspapers say, or your ideology.  Make sure you understand the facts as both sides say them. Take responsibility for yourself.  Other than a basic right to opportunity, you are not entitled to anything.  No one is.  My Mom certainly drilled that into us.  In the Western world we often forget the reason we live so well is because our parents and grandparents worked harder than the rest of the world to get here.  The more you feel entitled to things, the tougher your life will be because that’s just not how the world works. Work hard… and make sure it’s on the right things.

Fourth… and Best of All… Enjoy Your Life!
Live your life not what your parents, friends, or others think you should do.  Know what you want out of life and go after it. Keep life in perspective… most crises aren’t.   Things do generally look better in the morning.  Just by living in the United States and graduating with a degree from UNH, you are destined to live a more comfortable life than 90% of the rest of the world.

It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take life’s problems seriously.  It does mean you should keep your cool.   By staying level headed and keeping problems in perspective, particularly while others are panicking or losing their cool, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish and how you can emerge as a leader.

Don’t live a life of regrets… when confronted by a decision, think about how you’ll feel when you’re 60 years old and look back on it.  If you think you’ll regret not having taken the chance, don’t hesitate for a moment!

Remember the significance of family and friends.  They make life worth living.  I mentioned John and Ryan; they are the biggest accomplishment of my life.  I couldn’t be prouder of the men they have become.

And as my Dad used to say when asked how he was, “Can’t complain, nobody listens!”  As a son hearing it 700 times, it was irritating.  As an adult, I’ve learned how much truth there is in it.  Don’t dwell on what’s wrong with your life and don’t hang around with people who do.  If something is wrong, do something about it instead.  90% of people want to feel good about what they accomplished at work or home, hang around with those people.  Not the 10% who don’t even want to try. Enjoy work… it’s fulfilling, there is a satisfaction in the human condition caused by the striving toward an end.

Enjoy your life.  Don’t go through life angry or resentful.  Be able to walk outside and enjoy the warmth on your face of a sunny day.  Feel good about a walk on the beach, the joy of family and friends, and the feeling of accomplishment.

Concentrate on the things you can control and don’t waste time worrying about what you can’t.   I’m not a traditionally religious man, but I’ve always taken solace in a prayer written in 1932 by Reinhold  Niebuhr of the Union Theological Seminary in New
York.  It reads:

“God grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change, the courage to change the things I
can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

Congratulations on your accomplishment today, good luck with your careers, and remember… enjoy your lives.

Thanks for listening.


As your commencement speaker, I will be brief. I’m not going to be as brief as Salvador Dali, who once gave the world’s shortest speech  –  six seconds in duration. He said, “I will be so brief I have already finished,” and he sat down. There was the perfect commencement speaker, but I’m not and I will be reasonably brief, nonetheless, I promise.

And to the point. I’m going to seize this opportunity to describe the world in a way you may not have often heard it expressed, even at this great University, and certainly not widely, even at our best universities. It is that the 21st Century is going to be the Century of the Environment worldwide, and in science it is going to be the Century of Biology. The reason is simply that this is the time we either will settle down as a species or completely wreck the planet.

We will have to evolve a better world order than the one we have now, which I like to call our Star Wars Civilization. I mean we have stone-age emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. In the case of emotions, they evolved in pre-history over millions of years. In the case of our institutions, especially within religions and ideology, we are in constant conflict. And in the case of our technology, we are seeing things going almost beyond the control of our imagination. These three stanchions of current civilization explain why we are constantly in trouble. They are dangerous. They are very serious problems for the rest of life and, ultimately, for ourselves. And today we are still far from even at the margin of solutions.

At the base of the problem, I would like to suggest, are the three still mostly unanswered fundamental questions of religion, philosophy and science. They are: Where do we come from?, What are we?, and Where are we going? You graduates have dealt with aspects of these questions, the great riddle, here at this university, in parts and pieces, but everywhere our best thinkers are confounded by them. It is still the case, as the French writer Jean Bruller put it during the dark days of the 1930s. He said, for then as well as for today, “All of mankind’s problems are due to the fact that we do not know what we are and cannot agree on what we wish to become.”

In one area in particular, the environment, humanity urgently has to decide what we are, what we wish to become, and where we are going. And that is especially true for the way we relate ourselves to the rest of life. And we better do it soon.

The world is fortunately beginning to turn green, at least pastel green. But I’d like to call your attention to an imbalance in the way we are turning green. The emphasis today is on the physical environment, that is, on climate change, pollution, the decline of fresh water and arable land, and the depletion of irreplaceable natural resources. And it’s well and good that we focus on these matters.

But there has been proportionately much less attention paid to the living environment, and especially the diversity of life  –  biodiversity  –  which is the totality of the ecosystems, such as ponds, rivers, forests patches, and coral reefs; and then the species of plants, animals, and microorganisms that compose each of these ecosystems; and then the genes that prescribe the traits of the species that compose the ecosystems  –  all are at peril.

That great hierarchy and resource has taken three-and-a half billion years to emerge. Our lives depend upon it, because we are,   first and above all things, a biological species living in a very special biological world. Our relation to it can be put in a nutshell as follows. Scientists have found the biosphere, that razor-thin membrane plastered onto the surface of the earth, to be richer than ever before conceived. But due to human activity it is being eroded away at an accelerating rate. We estimate, those of us who measure such things, that the rate of species extinction is now about a thousand times higher than before humanity entered the scene, and furthermore if it is left unabated, half the species on Earth will be gone or on the edge of extinction by the end of the century. 

That loss of so much of the rest of life, if allowed to continue, is going to inflict a heavy price on you and future generations in wealth, security, and spirit. If on the other hand, the problem is solved, the benefits in wealth, security, and spirit will become beyond measure.

So the torch is passed to you here. Please take the torch of this fundamental problem and the opportunity it provides to understand and to contribute to its solution.

And now finally a piece of personal advice. This university, one of the best in America, has given you the means to be flexible, to look ahead and that capacity, with determination and hard work, means you will lead a fulfilling and honorable life. If you are planning on graduate studies and they feel right, then good for you. If you opted out of advanced studies, but think that it might have been right, consider trying it and find out. We need as many determined, highly educated citizens in this faltering country of ours as we can get.

At Harvard I advised students for decades on these matters and here is what I’ve said to those in particular who were planning to go, as undergraduates, into medical and law schools, but were still a little shaky about the whole thing.

There is an enormous, built-in, professional flexibility in an M.D. In addition to the large array of specializations and general practice within those, there is public health, there is hospital and medical institute administration, and then there is the vast and very rewarding world of medical research. For the graduate in law and those going into the law school, there are endless avenues open for practice and application, in business, in public service, in public and private administration in a wide diversity of venues.

And for you graduates in science, technology, and education, the 21st Century is indeed one to make a huge individual contribution.

And for all of you, for whatever future you have in mind, the future and changes are becoming radically new and different at warp speed. Ours is above and beyond all an exponential world, changing faster than at any previous period of history. We are now in the early period of an overwhelmingly techno-scientific civilization, connected literally person to person. The accumulated knowledge of the world is already at the zettabyte level  –  that’s a one followed by 21 zeroes of bytes. It is growing faster and faster by the digital revolution in communication, which is changing everything  –  all that we know, all that we need to quickly learn, all that we need to understand in order to survive as a species. 

The trajectory of history can only be dimly foreseen. It will consist of shocks and surprises. This country and the rest of the world needs university-trained young people prepared not only by knowledge itself but by the capacity to find new knowledge in order to respond quickly to unexpected needs and crises, challenging all the various professions, also in public affairs, and in simple, everyday life. And, with it all, to think upon and understand the meaning of humanity and yourselves and your lives. So, go forth. Think. Save the world.

But for now, congratulations to you and to your wonderful, justly proud, and much relieved parents. And thank y’all for having me with you and, as a son of Alabama, to become an honorary Tar Heel.

Thank you President Hurwitz, Board of Trustees, friends, visitors, families, the embassy representatives that are here with us today and all of my fellow Canadian, all of them who are watching from afar in Canada or watching this online. I thank you so much for the warm reception and the incredible honor it is to be receiving this Gallaudet University honorary doctorate degree in recognition of a body of work, work that could not have been done, could not have been achieved without the communities whose rights we have fought together to defend.

I feel very proud to have the dedicated energy in the direction that I have over the last number of years and owe thanks and support to my family, the Canadian Hearing Society, the Gallaudet community and the deaf and hard of hearing communities in Toronto and in Ontario, in Canada and internationally.

Let me take a moment to congratulate and salute the graduating class of 2011. It is a great honor to be here with you today, the graduates, families, friends, Gallaudet community, and all of the visitors that are here sharing this day with you. It’s an absolute privilege and a great honor to be here and to see all of the barriers that we are being able to move forward and break down, communication and language barriers.

We have had the privilege of making great strides in all of this faced by deaf and hard of hearing children and their families. I’d like to thank Dr. Karen Strauss also the recipient of an honorary doctorate degree today and her wonderful TDI team for championing civil rights for telecommunications equality, for deaf and hard of hearing citizens, and families globally, congratulations.

Gallaudet University was founded in 1864. That was three years before Canada’s confederation. Gallaudet brought Laurent Clerc from France and Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc worked together to start to establish a number of different schools for the deaf, not only in the United States, but in Canada which eventually led to the establishment of Gallaudet College.

On April 8, 1864, a congressional bill that allowed the Columbia Institution to grant degrees was signed by President Abraham Lincoln who of course we’re all aware championed freedom and rights to equality. The National Deaf-Mute College was established in 1864 and Gallaudet’s dream of establishing a college for Deaf adults became a reality.

Gallaudet was a leading advocate in North America and throughout the world, for educating deaf people. The 1880 International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in Milan, Italy, passed resolutions banning the use of signed languages in the classroom in schools for deaf students and disallowing deaf educators and even hearing educators with signed language skills to continue to teach globally.

However, amazingly and bravely, Gallaudet continued to allow sign languages to be used in its classrooms, and continued to employ deaf professors and hearing professors with sign language skills. Canadian David Peikoff attended and completed his degree at Gallaudet University in 1928, returning to Canada to become a revered deaf leader and Canadian activist, a strong advocate of education and employment for the deaf community.

He was one of the founding members of the National Society for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, renamed and now known as the Canadian Hearing Society. He was one of the founding members of the Canadian Association of the Deaf as well.

He once wrote that the “objective of education for the deaf is not to develop speech alone, but to produce a well-adjusted deaf adult, capable of enjoying life and functioning as taxpayer, not tax consumer. He defended the rights of children to accessible language and helped change laws to allow deaf drivers to drive.

After 30 years of advocating for the rights of deaf Canadians to gain access to sign language and to higher education and employment many Canadians were able to attend Gallaudet University and many returned and were able to receive gainful employment.

He and his wife, Polly, returned to Gallaudet University where he successfully was able to work with the Gallaudet Alumni Association in raising $1 million in Canadian funds, all of which was donated to Gallaudet University. He was a champion for volunteerism through the Gallaudet University Alumni Association for more than 20 years.

Dr. Andrew Foster is an important figure within the African-American history and deaf history. Not only did he establish many schools for deaf students in Africa, he was also the first African-American to graduate from Gallaudet College, and that was in 1954.He encouraged and inspired many Deaf and hard of hearing graduates of African Schools for Deaf students to come here and subsequently graduate from Gallaudet. Now many Deaf and hard of hearing African-American Gallaudet graduates are employed at the university, at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and in many schools for the deaf across North America and Africa.

One such graduate, Wilma Newhoudt-Druchenwas elected to the South African Parliament. After the World Federation of the Deaf Congress, Deaf Way I and Deaf Way II conferences and Gallaudet’s Leadership Training Institute, an increasing number of Gallaudet alumni have entered the political arena both running for government seats and in senior management appointments in the government.

Gallaudet University has invested in its students to become public office holders. In fact, more than ten Gallaudet alumni have been elected politicians or have enjoyed senior management positions at all levels of government: municipal, state, and federal.

When it was my time to receive an education, Gallaudet University provided me with the political and democratic skills training that I brought back to Canada and I’m so very proud to become the first elected deaf parliamentarian in North America. That was an office I held for five years. After which I joined the Canadian Hearing Society and have been involved in the senior management team for more than 15 years, but still working with government and government relations.

Today, we have many Deaf and hard of hearing professionals; whether they be doctors or lawyers, they participate in leadership. Examples of which Dr. Alan Hurwitz, Gallaudet University, Gerry Buckley, National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Benjamin Soukup, Communication Services for the Deaf, and Chris Kenopic, The Canadian Hearing Society, all of whom are presidents and CEOs. There are many, many more to come.

Gallaudet University is truly a home, and is an engine for higher education that continues to be an integral tool in the building of thousands of bridges between deaf and hard of hearing people who use sign languages and our general societies, including institutions at all levels of government.

In July, 2010, Gallaudet University delegates along with hundreds of delegates from around the world, including Dr. Alan Hurwitz, President, Gallaudet University, and I attended the International Congress of the Deaf in Vancouver, B.C., where we witnessed ICED declarations that: rejected all resolutions passed at the ICED Milan Congress in 1880 that denied the inclusion of signed languages in educational programs for deaf students, they acknowledged and sincerely regretted the detrimental effects of the Milan Conference resolutions and they called upon all nations of the world to remember history and to ensure that educational programs accept and respect all languages and all forms of communication.

Our reaction was a tearful and cheerful feeling of liberation. To date, over 147 different countries have signed, and 99 countries have ratified the United Nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. This is the largest ever, first-time signing and ratifying of a convention. the convention confirms the rights: to receive education and access to information in sign languages; To have professional sign language, spoken language interpreting; to accept and facilitate the use of sign languages, and to promote and facilitate the use of sign languages; to promote the cultural and linguistic identity of the deaf community; in addition to signed languages are defined as languages equal to spoken languages.

These are now powerful; this is now powerful ammunition in our fight for deaf education rights, including the protection of schools for deaf students and the removal of barriers to higher education, the elimination of sign language cleansing and our fight against all forms of discrimination and our fight for full and effective participation in democracy globally. The right to access language and language acquisition is a necessary prerequisite for exercising the right to human dignity, freedom of expression, and all other human rights.

Deaf and hard of hearing children have the right to barrier-free access to language acquisition during the early years when language is readily acquired. Sign languages in schools for the deaf are not only options but they’re the human right of deaf children and students, and it is on par with spoken languages and sign languages need to be accessible to our deaf children.

I watched President Obama’s inauguration on TV, I saw millions and millions of people cheering when he said, “We are shaped by every language and culture.” This not only aligns with Gallaudet University’s mission but it sends a very clear message globally. The surcharge on foreign students at Howard University was imposed in 1989. That’s when Congress approved a recommendation by the Department of Education.

The Howard University president Announced to the special convocation for South African President Nelson Mandela that Congress has rescinded the tuition surcharge that had been imposed on international students at the university.The rescission of the surcharge took effect with the tuition charges in 1995.

The late Dr. Andrew Foster, the late Dr. David Peikoff, along with WilmaNewhoudt-Druchen and I are all in the same company that supports the removal of surcharges for deaf and hard of hearing international students who want to come and study at Gallaudet University. These international students are our true hope. They will become our ambassadors of change, the ambassadors of democratic freedoms and the rights for higher education, and they will become our future leaders.

We would like to ask the Board of Trustees and the president of Gallaudet University to work with the Department of U.S. Education and the Congress of the United States to remove the surcharge for deaf and hard of hearing international students attending Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. This should make it possible for Gallaudet University to recruit a larger number of international students and graduate more international agents of change.

As President Clinton mentioned right here in his 1994 Gallaudet University Commencement keynote, he said that,“Gallaudet is a national treasure and as an international research university, Gallaudet should not have extra barriers that serve to exclude international students.”

The change in policy is enthusiastically supported by students and faculty at the University and by university alumni around the world. To me, Gallaudet University is clearly an international treasure. We know that deaf and hearing people are working together on the Gallaudet campus and globally and the goal is to build bridges, to gain respect for one another and to form a strong, unified front for the education of all levels of government, for local, regional, provincial, state, national and global societies at large.

Gallaudet University plays an integral role in the higher education of deaf and hard of hearing students and in achieving the goals of: equitable enjoyment of global life, effective civic participation, the democratic and educational rights of culturally deaf, deaf oral, deafened and hard of hearing people, a society free of discrimination, and sign language cleansing, full access to language acquisition and multilingualism, and viable educational placement for our children.

Today, I ask you, families, friends and esteemed guests of the 2011 graduates, along with elected representatives of U.S. Congress, U.S. Education Department, donors, sponsors, elected Parliamentarians, ambassadors and representatives of the embassies to join me in thanking the Gallaudet community for its invaluable contribution, and to join me in knowing that your continued funding of one of the most accessible, higher post-secondary education institution makes possible the education of our future leaders and this will reshape and improve our societies globally.

In closing, let me tell you what I believe Gallaudet stands for: G – Global Access to higher post-secondary education, A – attitudinal barrier-free society, L- learning and liberation, L- leadership in building bridges and respect, A- agent of change, U- universal design, D- democracy and true freedom, E- excellence, a true center of excellence, T -transformation into full global citizenship, participation and enjoyment.

Congratulations again to the class of 2011 and to Gallaudet University. Laurent Clerc, President Abraham Lincoln, Edward Miner Gallaudet, Andrew Foster and David Peikoff are looking down upon us today with extreme pride in what you have accomplished. You’ve done it. Congratulations!I’m so very proud of all of you. 

Internationally, globally, thank you, and thanks to everybody who is watching in Canada.

Seniors, I'm so glad it's finally stopped raining and has turned into a beautiful day today. I've been concerned that this might be the most outdoor fun you've had all week.

I want to thank President Nugent, members of the faculty and administration, and especially the Class of 2011 and families and friends, for inviting me to address you on this very special occasion.

When President Nugent notified me of this honor—and after I had thought about it for a few weeks—it occurred to me that the best I could presume to offer you were simple observations drawn from my own experiences. While hardly the wisdom of the ages, this has occasionally resulted in certain opportunities and successes for those with whom I have had the privilege of working.

President Nugent has often drawn attention to the idea that my time at the College has been marked by young men and women who have wanted to be on my team. To the extent that this is true—and for me to even be standing here before you today—I can only assume one thing:

.... at some level you want to be coached!

So, in a few minutes we're going to have a short coaching session.

But, before I begin, I want to clear up some misconceptions about what it means to be coached, and I subsequently want to define performance from my perspective.

About a year after President Nugent arrived at the College we had an opportunity to have lunch together at the Kenyon Inn. At the time she remarked to me that she had noticed that some of the coaches at the College were among our best teachers. Of course, I was flattered by her compliment, but I had never really envisioned myself as a teacher. I responded, in turn, to President Nugent that I had noticed in my nearly thirty years at Kenyon that many of our teachers were among our best coaches!

Now, this was certainly not a case of me having a low opinion of teachers and a high opinion of coaches. I can assure you, I don't. But it was a recognition of what I had consistently come to expect from our best teaching faculty. They provoke. They inspire. They demand. They challenge their students to get out of their comfort zone, move away from their sclerotic and narrow view of the world, and take a chance on believing they might have more to offer than they think they do. Imparting a body of knowledge was less central to the process of learning than imbuing a sense of self-discovery.

Coaches, at their best, are provocateurs. Fundamentals of the game are important, but a greater concern is challenging someone to decide what it is they want to do, and why, and how one is going to get from point A to B without losing oneself in the process. When a deep bond of trust and understanding is established between a coach and an athlete as a result of time shared, then four simple words hold great meaning and inspiration for that athlete and serve as a call to action: you can do better! I've noticed this same dynamic with our best teachers and their students.

I may use a few 'sports metaphors' in coaching you today but do not presume I know any more about sports than any of you. This discussion will not devolve into how you can run faster, throw farther, train better, or, God-forbid, swim more efficiently.

Truth be told, I'm not much of an athlete myself. I have very little interest in—or knowledge of—sports, and even less interest in sports cultures. I don't watch SportsCenter. I'm not a fan of professional teams of any sort. I couldn't tell you what a triple-double is, how a 2-3 zone defense works, or what constitutes off-sides in soccer. A few years ago I was invited by the Buckeye football staff to join them on the sidelines for the annual Ohio State-Michigan rivalry. Much to the disappointment of my friends, I politely declined. It's a standing joke in my family that a day of fishing in the morning, a round of golf in the afternoon, and a baseball game at night would be a form of punishment for me.

It's fair to say I know a little bit about the mechanics and the energetics of swimming, but, let's face it, as a game it's pretty simple. One performs in a contained environment, making one's way up and down a clearly marked, unimaginative path countless times with the sole objective of arriving in time and in a good position. What makes this challenging is the fact that one negotiates this path while carrying a veritable panoply of emotions, expectations, and desired outcomes—all of which change from day to day, month to month, and year to year.

Come to think of it, this is not too different from your life on the Hill. You've been in a contained environment, making your way up and down a clearly marked path, always hoping to arrive in time and in a good place, and you have negotiated this path in a variety of different states. Sometimes you were threatened by how unprepared you were for what lay ahead. Other times you were totally captivated by the beauty and serenity of the moment, fully committed to the purpose of where you were going. The point is, like swimming, this is a place that has tested you, inspired you, brought you down and lifted you up, and ultimately, hopefully, challenged you in your own capacity to perform.

I may not be into sports in general, but I am totally captivated by performance and what it means to perform at the highest possible level. I'm fascinated by individuals who do things well, very well, in any arena. As a consequence, I'm drawn to great matchups in sports that I don't fully understand, in awe of honors presentations that leave me scratching my head, and humbled by any number of recitals, exhibitions, concerts, and performances that all promise something of value being put to the test.

The types of performance that interest me the most are those actions, deeds, and thoughts that can be measured or evaluated and compared to a standard, a standard of excellence. We're not talking about the day-in-and-day-out routine of merely showing up, simply doing what's expected and fulfilling requirements. For me, one's capacity to perform is a factor of time and effort, incentive and circumstance, with all the thought and action that went into the performance evaluated by how successfully it was mastered.

And make no mistake, mastery is what we're talking about here. The pathway to mastery has many different twists and turns, but there are two characteristics that are fundamental to the rhythm of mastery—discipline and risk. It's hard to imagine anyone being successful at anything without some measure of unrelenting effort, practice, or study. I find it equally hard to believe that anyone could scale the heights of greatness without taking a chance on attempting something new and risking failure. I know both sets of circumstances have been true in my world.

Malcolm Gladwell in his New York Times bestseller Outliers puts "the magic number of greatness" at 10,000 hours—the amount of time it takes to perform really well at anything. That's six hours a day, six days a week for six years. Gladwell's theory is based on the idea that one's capacity to perform successfully at the highest level is a choice, not a birthright.

No doubt, many of us at this institution see the value, if not the necessity, of sustained periods of time and effort if one is serious about changing one's capacity to perform. A few years ago I had an individual on my team who was quite talented and had the capacity to work extremely hard, albeit intermittently. He had aspirations of competing against the very best in the country, any division. Over the summer, while on an extended trip with friends, he wrote me wanting to know what he needed to do to achieve at a higher level. I replied as follows:

"A momentary flurry of intensity over a relatively short period of time, while challenging and sometimes beneficial, pales in comparison to the day-in-and-day-out consistency needed in order to move to the next level. If you truly want to be the best and 'create' something worthwhile, you have to train like the best. And the best do not necessarily train harder than we do. But they DO train more consistently over longer periods of time."

Now this may sound 'Gladwellian' to you, and certainly I'm of the persuasion that the ability to perform at higher levels is a choice in part determined by one's commitment to putting in the necessary time and effort, but it doesn't explain all success. I'm not necessarily convinced that six hours a day, six days a week, for six years, with no breaks, is the absolute best formula for improving everyone's capacity to perform.

Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert comic strip, in a recent essay in the Wall Street Journal entitled "How to Get a Real Education" offers some catchy but insightful lessons on how to be successful in entrepreneurship. But in my experience his key points carry great value for what it takes to get better in virtually any area. Three lessons in particular stand out.

Adams first talks about the importance of "combining skills," suggesting it's unlikely most people will develop a "world-class skill" in any one area but that it's not that difficult to learn how to do fairly well in a few different areas. Adams reveals, "I succeeded as a cartoonist with negligible art talent, some basic writing skills, an ordinary sense of humor, and a bit of experience in the business world. The Dilbert comic is a combination of all four skills. The world has plenty of better artists, smarter writers, funnier humorists, and more experienced business people. The rare part is that each of those modest skills is collected in one person. That's how value is created."

Adams further discusses the idea of "failing forward," which, in my mind, is not only invaluable from a career perspective, but also absolutely essential from a performance perspective. According to the author,"If you're taking risks, and you probably should, you can find yourself failing 90 percent of the time. The trick (and, parents, you'll love this!) is to get paid while you're doing the failing, and to use the experience to gain skills that will be useful later. I failed at my first career in banking. I failed at my second career with the phone company. But you'd be surprised at how many of the skills I learned in those careers can be applied to almost any field, including cartooning. Students should be taught that failure is a process, not an obstacle."

Best of all is the lesson Adams offers on "attracting luck", a point on which I believe I've built an entire career. Adams suggests,"You can't manage luck directly, but you can manage your career in a way that makes it easier for luck to find you. To succeed, first you must do something. And if that doesn't work, which can be 90 percent of the time, do something else. Luck finds the doers."

As far as developing one's capacity to perform is concerned, let us agree that a concentration of effort over some period of time is absolutely essential, as is the necessity of balancing one's performance expectations with one's inherent ability and the reality of one's life.

Dr. Joel Stager, director of the Human Performance Lab at Indiana University, in his 30 years of lab research has observed the following: "There are commonly only two responses when people walk into the lab for their aerobic capacity to be tested. One group asks, 'How long do I have to run?' and the other group asks, 'Who has the highest value you've ever recorded?' I'll let you guess which group consists of the elite performers!" In summarizing performance capacity, I find myself agreeing with Dr. Stager when he says, "We are not all born equal, but perhaps it is more about doing the most with what you were born with than letting what you weren't born with limit your performance."

Coaching Session
OK. We're ready for our coaching session. This is a little larger team than I am used to, but let's give it a shot. I'm not going to ask you get up and move around or stand up and cheer. This session is definitely not interactive. Like generations of Kenyon swimmers, all you have to do is sit there and take it! Decide for yourself if anything makes sense or if you have a better way of looking at things.

I have three coaching points I want to make with you today, and they all relate to one's capacity to perform. Before I begin, however, allow me the one convention of this business that I fully embrace, for reasons that aren't necessarily related to sports. (Steen replaces academic cap with baseball cap).

OK, thanks. I'm ready to go!

So, how's your attitude?

Probably pretty good today. What's not to be good? You've successfully made it from point A to point B and tomorrow you'll have all the necessary credentials to prove it!

What's your attitude going to be like on Monday? Or next month? Or next fall? I'm sure some of you have jobs lined up, many of you are off to graduate school, a few of you will be traveling, and still others are uncertain about what you're going to be doing in the next few weeks, let alone the next few years. From my point of view that's OK, because regardless of what you're doing next week or next year, things will change and, in some cases, things will change dramatically. What's most important in this whole process, however, is attitude.

Back in the mid-90s I had a big, strapping sprinter on my team, with a big booming voice, who won a couple of NCAA titles in the 50-yard freestyle. Fortunately, everybody on the team liked this guy, because when anyone was having a difficult practice, or a bad meet, or an awful day in class, or a problem with coach, his comment was always the same, "Hey, man, it's all about attitude!" No doubt, an individual of lesser stature offering the same admonition over and over again would have been persecuted! Even though this guy wasn't the hardest worker on the team, or the most talented, no one ever doubted the direction he was going.

And that's what's important to remember about attitude. It's not whether it's good or bad, but does it define your direction? If the best path in getting from point A to point B is due north, I've had very few individuals on my team who have made the serious choice to head south! People usually fall short because they're a degree or two off in attitude and, over time and distance that can put you in a place far away from where you would like to be.

You may have honestly assessed what constitutes a journey in the right direction, but if you're not performing the way you want to perform don't look at what you're doing, look at your attitude.

On my team, when I challenge someone's attitude—and I love doing that—it's not an attack on their character. It's a belief in their ability to get back on course.

What you have made of your life today is a result of the attitude you established for yourself when you came to this place in the fall of 2007. Your life in the future will be the result of the attitude you set for yourself when you leave this hallowed ground. If you're fortunate to have people in your life like you've had here at Kenyon—people you trust, people who know and appreciate you well enough to look you in the eye and remind you that you can do better, listen to them and make the necessary adjustment in your attitude. The worst position to be in is not slightly off course, and it's doubtful that any of you are deliberately going to head due south. The worst position to be in is a belief by you, or those around you, that you couldn't possibly do any better than you're currently doing!

OK. We've pretty much redefined attitude as it relates to performance. Let's take a look at your capacity to prepare.

How is your work ethic?

Is it helping you or hurting you in your capacity to perform? During your time on the Hill did you give it your best? Or did you avoid putting in the time and effort necessary to fully take advantage of your opportunities?

Regardless of how you performed at Kenyon, we can all agree—whether we subscribe to the 10,000-hour rule or not—that a sustained period of focused attention and applied effort is absolutely essential in getting better at anything that really matters. And, yet, hard work, in my experience, is not the sole determinant of one's capacity to achieve. In fact, one's sense of what can be accomplished in any endeavor—what is truly possible—is often compromised by too much hard work and too little imagination. All work and no play may make Jack a dull boy, but all work and no imagination will most definitely make Jack an under-performer. Of this I'm absolutely convinced!

It's been my experience that the hardest workers are not always the most prolific performers. The correlation between grinding it out, day in and day out, and the capacity to perform at transcendent levels does not always appear to be direct. In discussing this with my fellow coaches on the faculty over the years, I've picked up on similar sentiments. The student who puts in the work is not always the student who is the most creative and engaged in their thinking. If you have a limited imagination—a limited concept of what's possible—then performing in a truly exceptional manner at any level, in any arena, is improbable at best, irrelevant at worst.

You may have the talent to excel. You may have the intelligence to excel. You may have the work ethic and competitiveness to excel. But the real question is: do you have the imagination and creativity to continuously 'reframe' your reality so it is consistent with your highest aspirations? Imagination fuels perspective and perspective puts one in touch with the bigger picture. The bigger picture, in turn, allows for more possibilities and more ideas. Performing at one's best begins with the creation and expression of an idea—nothing more, nothing less.

Do you have the imagination to see yourself doing something truly exceptional? Certainly it's difficult to sustain a leap of the imagination that isn't, in part, grounded in the knowledge and appreciation of one's inherent abilities. But it's been my experience that people greatly under value their capacity to perform and, as a result, their capacity to achieve.

Imagination can be improved. Committing the best of yourself to any worthwhile endeavor requires that you do so. By attaching your efforts to whatever it is you choose to do in a way that stimulates your imagination, you enhance your capacity to perform at any level. To quote no less a 'performer' than Albert Einstein on this subject,

"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."

My final coaching point of the day: It's my contention that in any given moment one lives one's life in one of two ways, either under a threat or for a challenge. In performing when it counts, it's one or the other, under a threat or for a challenge. If, as Einstein says, "Imagination will take you everywhere," then living your life under a threat will take you nowhere.

Perceived threats, often resulting in fear, invariably compromise our capacity to perform in the manner we most desire. And there are all sorts of perceived threats that ultimately reduce us in stature, making us feel small, insignificant, and powerless. There is the threat of failure. The threat of not measuring up. The threat of pain. The threat of humiliation. The threat of illness or injury. The threat of not being appreciated or valued. The threat of being exposed for who we are. The threat of not being understood. And the list goes on and on.

It's so easy to live one's life threatened by the outcome we fear that we deaden our senses to the process, content to merely occupy time and space, satisfied with a half-life of sorts. We go through the motions, occasionally wake up, look for our shadow, and quickly scurry back into our den of predictability.

Sound familiar?

And yet it is possible to reframe our threats into challenges and get a much better return on our performance investment with little more time and effort involved. In doing so, you first have to wake up. You have to be among the living! A conscious decision needs to be made that you're not going to allow the same threats to keep undermining your performance.

Second, you have to be honest with yourself, recognizing and acknowledging that which most threatens you. It has to be disclosed to someone you trust. It can't continue to remain a secret.

Third, you need to cultivate the two qualities we talked about earlier that are fundamental to one's capacity to perform—discipline and risk—and then you need to know how and where to apply these qualities most effectively in reframing threats into challenges. Discipline and risk, when applied directly to living one's life for the challenge, have a way of offsetting the threats that tend to compromise our capacity to perform.

Ask and answer the following questions:

Do you have the capacity to see the challenge in any situation in which you feel threatened?
Do you have the discipline to prepare for and stay focused on the challenge?
Are you willing to risk predictability in pursuit of the challenge?
If the challenge itself becomes your truth in any endeavor, can you really be threatened? Risk waking up to see your world for what it truly is—a playing field of limitless challenges designed for your personal edification and enlightenment. That being the case, and it is, what threat, if any, awaits you? Only one. Not playing the game.

Herein concludes our coaching session, but on Monday you start a new game. The good news is your attitude, imagination, and ability to see challenges where previously you saw only threats has been sharpened significantly during your time at Kenyon.

David Brooks, in a recent New York Times column, suggests that high performing individuals "begin with two beliefs: (1) the future can be better than the present, and (2) I have the power to make it so."

When you leave the Hill this weekend accept the challenge of starting over, attempt to perform well in some capacity, and, if you are successful in becoming a somebody at something (and many of you will), I would offer you the following advice Jon Stewart gave his audience at a show in Columbus a few weeks ago:

"Be proud of who you are, but don't wield it as a club."

Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you today.

Thank you, President Reveley. Congratulations to my two fellow honorary degree recipients Brian Lamb and Marian Wright Edelman. And greetings, Class of 2011.

You're 20, 25, 30 minutes–maybe an hour–from the zenith of your years of effort. Only an insurance guy stands between you and your degree. How in God’s name did it come to this?

The “insurance guy” standing before you was once a rare Italian American on campus. On my first day, my English professor read the roll and called out “Pulmonary.”

No one answered.

I realized he meant me. I spoke up. And this is virtually the first thing I ever said on this campus: “Professor, I am not an artery.”

In Williamsburg, in 1962, they weren't used to northerners with Italian names.

That’s one of a thousand memories I have of William & Mary. I bet you have a thousand, too. Memories are what make this place special. This campus is a shrine of tradition. But tradition can be a jailor. It’s the dreams of where life will lead you that I’ll talk about today.

You may wonder why I’ve stayed so involved in this college over forty years. This place helped me realize my dreams. Dreams, fed by vision, passion, integrity and an enduring belief that anything is possible, is what you and I share, bridged by the decades.

A survey once asked people older than me – octogenarian CEOs – to reflect on their careers. Collectively, they wished they had taken more risks, had more fun, and built more monuments to things they believed in.

I’ve taken risks. Big ones. And I’ve had fun. Lots of it. And there’s something more.

I believe deeply in this place, and I’m proud to have supported it. Looking out today, you represent a living monument of what I believe in: an awesome school called William & Mary.

As you take your degree, you’re joining some pretty heady company.

This place produced sixteen signers of the Declaration of Independence. And we won’t be making any more of them.

But it’s produced four Supreme Court justices—so far.

Eight Cabinet members—so far.

Thirty-one governors—so far.

Three Presidents of the United States—so far.

And, while my count may be off, one great insurance guy—so far.

The potential of all of you, and those that follow in your footsteps, is why I say “so far.”

William & Mary has a centuries-old tradition of producing leaders in politics, industry and culture – a wellspring of women and men of character that the world requires.

It’s daunting to follow in their footsteps. Guess what? You don’t have to. You shouldn’t.

Don’t live by the old standards of people long dead memorialized in oil on campus walls. As great as our traditions are, we don’t want this college to be about their memories. We want it to be about your dreams.

I’m living proof that each one of you can be builders of a future dream.

Playing in Traffic 

In your time here, you’ve been taught not to rely on tradition but to question the status quo.

We revere our Founding Fathers, many of whom passed through this campus. But when they propelled us toward revolution, there was no tradition to guide them. All they did was question, with good reason, decades of dictatorial British rule.

In 1989, in Tiananmen Square, a lone protestor known as Tank Man did the same thing standing before a column of Chinese tanks.

A few months ago, in 2011, a young Google executive in Cairo named Wael Ghonim helped engineer a revolution overthrowing a corrupt regime.

From Williamsburg to Beijing to Cairo, what united them all, separated by centuries, was a collective courage to defy tradition and play in traffic.

Let’s agree that throwing yourself in front of a Chinese tank takes playing in traffic to the extreme. What I mean by playing in traffic is that, each of you in your own way, need to take risks, mix it up and make something happen.

Wael Ghonim did something like that a year ago. He created a Facebook page, the simplest act in the social media playbook. But because that Facebook page brought attention to the beating, and death, of a young Egyptian named Khaled Saeed, Wael Ghonim is to Egypt what Paul Revere was to the 13 colonies.

Sometimes, it requires great personal risk. Other times, it only requires you move beyond your comfort zone. And that’s my message: go play in traffic, and find out what’s possible. You won’t make a difference by sitting on the sidelines.

Let me tell you a story.

In 1968, with a William & Mary degree and two years of coaching football and teaching history under my belt, I was going to New York Law School part time. And I went looking for a job. I figure, I’m a law student, I ought to work in a law firm.

It didn’t occur to me that maybe I ought to be a lawyer first, but never mind.

I didn’t know much about the law, but I knew one thing: every place with three names is a law firm. Like Dewey Cheatham & Howe. So I found a place called Carter, Berlind & Weill.

Three names. A law firm, right? So I showed up, walked in the door and asked for a job.

The receptionist sent me back to talk to Mr. Sandy Weill. He asked me what I wanted to do.

I said I wanted to work at a law firm. He said, “This isn’t a law firm.” I go, “Really. Well, I’m flexible.” Turns out it was a brokerage. So, you see, your education doesn’t stop when you graduate. I learned something right there.

I said, I don’t know what you do here, but I’ll bet I can do it.

Sandy Weill must have thought I had moxie—you might say cojones now—because he gave me a job at his company—a company you know by a different name today: Citigroup.

The firm back then didn’t have much room for me. They gave me a student-sized desk and plunked it half inside a closet, half sticking out into the hallway.

“Hey, Joey Baby,” the guys in suits would say, slapping me upside the head as they walked passed my desk, heading in to review their numbers with Mr. Weill.

Twenty years later, “Joey Baby,” who didn’t know what a brokerage was but could rope-a-dope with the guys in suits, became President of Shearson Lehman Brothers.

And those who used “Joey Baby’s” head for a speed bag? I remembered each of their names. They found themselves on a different compensation plan later on.

That’s what you have to do to play in traffic: show up, knock on doors, scrap, be engaged, do something. Things will happen.

...

When you do, keep four big ideas in mind. You could call them four signs along the road.

Here’s Number one: have a vision and go for it.

Number two: bring passion to your vision.

Number three: match your passion and vision with integrity.

And number four: remember, absolutely anything is possible.

I want to bring these four signs to life by talking about people I know – and people in this graduating class – who put these ideas into action. The 1st Road Sign: Vision

The first road sign is “have a vision.”

Before Lou Holtz brought me here on a football scholarship, I had another education: watching my father and grandfather make their way in the world.

My grandfather came here on a boat from Sicily, arriving at Ellis Island. He figured the best way to become an American was to do American things. So he pursued an unlikely career in baseball: with a thousand dollars he recruited Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig to barnstorm the country, the diamond heroes inspiring kids at every stop.

This immigrant, this man with a vision, went on to own the Trenton Giants, a team Willie Mays played for on his way to the Big Leagues.

Then Trenton went without a pro baseball team for over forty years until my father, Sam, reignited my grandfather’s vision. Sam was 80 years old at the time, just getting over quintuple bypass surgery. But he was like a thunder you couldn’t control.

“I want to bring baseball back to Trenton,” he told anyone who’d listen.

“Why don’t you get some rest, Pop,” I told him.

He told me we should raise buy a team, move it to New Jersey, and rejuvenate the town. He won that argument with me.

He also won over the politicians. He won over the press. And he won over the community. At a point in life when many people sit back and watch games on their sofas, he was in the arena, helping to build a ballpark – a monument to his vision that still stands today as the home of the Trenton Thunder, our Double A Affiliate of the New York Yankees.

My father was my best friend. When I ran into trouble in my freshman year and wanted to leave William & Mary, he told me, as only a dad can, to stick it out.

My mother, Josephine, was by his side all the way. She’s 98 today, still thriving, and wishes she could be here today as she was when I graduated in 1966.

She’s represented by the thousands of proud William & Mary parents gathered around us. Value your parents, and love them. Because long before you had the vision to be sitting out there, a great education under your belts and a world of opportunity ahead, that was their vision for you. And for their vision, let’s give them some thanks and applause today,

...

A mentor helps, doesn’t it? Let’s thank Dr. Allison and all the faculty of William & Mary for what they do to mold and shape the vision of our students into life-changing, life-affirming action. Thanks to all of you.

The 2nd Road Sign: Passion

If “vision” is where you’re going, then “passion” is the commitment to getting there. And that’s the second big sign along the road.

When I attended here, compared to today, there was little in the way of technology. But there was heart. This place had heart. It still does.

You can Google for an answer. You can Google for a mate. You can Google for a career. But you can’t Google to find what’s in your heart – the passion that lifts you skyward.

I was getting on a helicopter one day when the pilot left the cockpit right before we took off. Uh-oh, I thought. He bounded over to me and hugged me, and he said, “I love you, man.”

That’s nice, the pilot loves me. Could be worse.

So I board the chopper and put on the headset so we can talk. I gotta find out why the pilot loves me.

And he says, “Joe, I saw you speak in the Georgia Dome in front of 80,000 people when you were head of Primerica Financial Services.” And you said, “You gotta find the thing you feel passionate about and do it, no matter what.” That inspired me to do start this helicopter business. And today I have this great life because you inspired me to find my passion.”

I want all of you to find your passion, too. Find the thing that inspires you, that makes you want to get up in the morning, and get to it.

Tribe athletes know about passion.

In the fall, cross country, soccer and the football team took their titles. And in 2010, this became the first school to earn 100 CAA championships.

The athletes at this college have a passion to win.

In fact, it’s a trait unique to everyone at this school.

...

Passion is the DNA of life. This class is filled with stories like those. If I recited the passionate pursuits of everyone here, I’d still talking when the Class of 2012 graduates.

If you played on one of the William & Mary sports teams, and did so with a passion to win and excel, please stand up.

And every other member of the Class of 2011 – whether you pursued your passion in the laboratory, on the stage or in the classroom, please stand up too.

Anyone who used their years here to pursue excellence with passion in your chosen fields of endeavor, this is your moment to stand and be recognized by the parents who fed your passion to go here, and the faculty who helped shape that passion once you arrived.

What you brought to William & Mary, you will bring to the world.

This, my friends, is a tribe, joined for a simple purpose to pursue and express their passion.

Parents and faculty, please give them a hand.

The 3rd Road Sign: Integrity

If you’re going to take chances and play in traffic – it takes passion and vision.

But it takes integrity, too. And that’s the third big road sign of life.

v Integrity is really simple: It’s just being true to who you are.

About ten years ago, I found myself in Paris. I was 57, basically retired. I had spent 32 years of my life with Citigroup, the place I started, when I thought Sandy Weill ran a law firm.

A guy named Henry Kravis contacted me. That’s a name you might not know, but he’s one of the titans of global investment. Henry and his firm, KKR, wanted me to take over and revitalize an old British brokerage they owned called the Willis Group.

By now, I’d figured out the difference between a brokerage and a law firm, so I had that going for me.

I went up to London to check out the firm. I could have walked in acting like an extra in “The King’s Speech,” but that’s not me. Instead, the chilly reception I got in London was as if Fonzi had ridden his motorcycle right into Buckingham Palace.

I wasn’t going to try to pretend to be a British gentleman. I know who I am, and Henry wanted me running Willis because of who I am.

So I walk in, offer a proper handshake, and I say, “How ya doin?”!

This started what’s been a wonderful decade at the helm of Willis by being true to myself. And wherever you go from here, you all have to be true to yourselves, too.

...

Integrity means being who you are, no matter what. It’s the only way to get where you’re going and be truly happy how you got there.

The 4th Road Sign: Anything Is Possible

Here’s the last big road sign of life: Anything is possible.

There is always some dream-stealer out there who’ll tell you “you can’t.”

...

But you can. Because anything is possible. Say it with me: “Anything Is Possible.” In Chicago, at 1,451 feet, you’ll find the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.

It used to be called the Sears Tower. Now it’s called the Willis Tower.

They said you can’t change the name of the Sears Tower. But I thought – yes I can. I’m a William and Mary graduate, and I’ve learned anything is possible.

This was 2009. Sears had been out of that tower for 20 years. A lot of other businesses were moving out, too. The economy was pretty grim. That emptied out tower was a big, skyline-sized reminder of the global collapse.

That old name was a reminder, too.

My company, Willis, had just completed the biggest-ever merger of insurance brokers. I had a lot of people in Chicago in the combined company who needed a home. I figured, why not put them in that tower, wipe the slate clean, and name it after the new operation moving in?

An economic recovery needs people to show confidence that there’s prosperity up ahead.

Maybe it’s just a new name, but a new name can help make a new start. And a new start reminds people that no matter how entrenched the old ways are – anything is possible.

And you know what people told me? You’re crazy. You can’t rename the Sears Tower.

The word “can’t” hasn’t stopped me yet. So I used a few tricks up my sleeve.

One was going on the local radio talk shows. On one of the drive-time stations, before I came on the air, the host starts mocking me with a fake British accent. He said, “And now, direct from London, here’s the chairman of the Willis Group, Mr. Joseph Plumeri.”

Not even my mother calls me Joseph.

So he’s expecting a British guy. I didn’t give them the Prince of Wales, I gave them Joe from Trenton. I leaned into that microphone and I said – “How ya doin’?”

In a little while, I helped remind Chicago that this is a city where anything is possible. Despite a bad economy, we really could move forward, and this was one way to do that.

And it worked. Today, they call that building the Willis Tower. Some call it The Big Willie. Trust me, I know how that sounds.

Wherever I go, people always quiz me: “how were you able to rename a landmark?” “What was the magic?”

There was no magic. The answer was simple. I asked. In the face of all the doubters, I asked because I believe deep in my heart that anything is possible.

My hero in life is Winston Churchill. If he was Italian, he would’ve been really great.

After World War II, after enduring hardship with his countrymen and leading Britain through the Blitz and onto victory, he ran for re-election and was soundly beaten.

He said, “Success is never final, failure is never fatal: it is courage that counts.”

You can constantly strive to make a difference other people don’t have the courage to do.

That young man in Tiananmen Square had the courage to stare down a column of tanks.

Weal Ghonim, that Google executive in Egypt, had the courage to start a movement.

The courage to have a vision. The courage to have passion. The courage to have integrity. The courage to believe that anything is possible.

Most people in the world know all these words.

They know “vision” – but they don’t see it.

They know “passion” – but they don’t feel it.

They know “integrity” – but they don’t live by it.

They know the words – but they don’t know the music.

In your years at William & Mary, you learned the words. I’ve just told you where the music comes from. It comes from your heart. I told you earlier this place has heart. Now you know what I mean.

The music is the visceral, electrifying feeling you have in your heart. See it. Feel it. Live by it. Go play in traffic, the music beating in your heart, knowing that anything is possible.

In life, there are "Ready, Set" people and there are "Ready, Set, Go" people.

The “Ready, Set” people spend their lives preparing, analyzing, talking and never jump.

Then there’s the “Go” people. They want to make things happen.

That’s what you are. That’s what you’ve said for four years—Go Tribe!

Go play in traffic, and let’s say our War Cry one more time together: Go Tribe!

Thank you so much. 

Thanks for having me here today. Seriously I’m very honored to be her today I know this is a very special moment for you. This is a celebration for you a celebration of all the hard work you’ve put in, all the late nights of studying, and the extra jobs and loans you had to take out to pay your tuition.

So congratulations! You deserve it. Congratulations not only to you graduates but to your families and friends that are here with you today and have supported you along the way. I see a lot of proud faces in the audience. You deserve to be proud.

When I look at you I see myself, over a decade ago, when I was in your shoes. I might look young, but I graduated a long time ago, back in the 20th century, 1999, from the University of Pennsylvania and I remember sitting at my own commencement ceremony. I sat in a seat just like yours filled with nostalgia and appreciation, a little bit of anxiety and uncertainty but also a healthy dose of anticipation and optimism.

I always get excited when I come back to speak to college students because I really have faith in you. I know you’re intelligent, motivated and you’re ready to do something big in the world. I believe that you graduates have unlimited potential to create a major change in the world. When you leave this campus you will take with you an abundance of knowledge, an extensive vocabulary and perhaps most important, the ability to think critically, to question assumptions and to challenge ideas. That’s what comprises a great education.

Consider this education a gift. I know what you’re thinking, that was the most difficult expensive gift I’ve ever received and you’re right. It was expensive and it was difficult. You overcame significant obstacles to be here but I think you know it was well worth it. You are now equipped and empowered with the tools you need to succeed in life. That’s something you shouldn’t take for granted. Not everyone gets this opportunity. I’ve seen, first hand, how a good education changed my own life as it will undoubtedly change yours.

I don’t know about you but I was an exception in my neighborhood. The majority of my high school didn’t even make it to high school graduation, let alone college. You are the recipients, in a nation where a college education is not always a given. Take a minute to consider the alternative for those who don’t receive this gift, this privilege.

Without an education doors remain closed. Opportunities don’t arise. Lack of education often seals the fate of individuals trapped in the cycle of poverty. As a nation we see too much of this. The United States had dropped from first to 18th in high school graduation rates among developing nations. While this is statistically unsettling enough as it is consider that just 15 percent of our schools are responsible for 50 percent of the dropouts.

That means those schools have a high concentration of dropouts and those schools happen to be concentrated in our poorest communities, the communities that are most in need of the transformative power of a good education. These places are sometimes, unfortunately, called dropout factories. They are perpetuating the cycle of poverty in low income communities. It is abundantly clear the education system in the U.S. is in need of repair. Many of our schools are literally and figuratively crumbling. We’re not giving kids, especially low income kids, the chance to succeed, to make it through high school, let alone college.

It’s what they call educational inequality. The sad and unchangeable reality is that where a child is born, what color that child is or how much money that child’s parents make often determines the quality of his or her education. In the land of opportunity that’s not just. That’s not fair. That’s not America. We’re better than that.

Right here in New Jersey we can see a massive achievement gap. Although New Jersey does fit in the rates of overall student achievement, it ranks 47 for the size of its achievement gap between economically advantaged kids and disadvantaged kids.

This means that while the state consistently delivers a quality education to privileged students, it often fails those with fewer resources. The gap has not changed over the last three decades. I think that’s a call for action.

I don’t share these statistics with you to discourage you. I’m not here to be the depressing guy. There is good news which I’ll get to soon but we have to talk about problems before we can talk about solutions. As it stands a good education in the United States of America, one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations on this planet, remains a gift for some when it should be a right for all.

I echo the remarks of a national leader who took a huge political risk to champion civil rights in the thick of a battle during the 1960’s. Between the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, two landmark pieces of legislation that established fundamental for all Americans regardless of race, our president, Lyndon Johnson, delivered the 1965 commencement address at our university, a historically black university in the nation’s capital. He titled this speech “To Fulfill these Rights.” He said that not only is the importance of civil rights legislation that these newly enshrined rights were only the foundation for the work to be done. In his words, “This is the next and more profound stage for the battle of civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact, equality as a result.”

This call to action reigns true today. Frankly, his aspirations remain unfulfilled and education inequality lies at the heart of the problem. I believe that education is the civil rights issue of our generation and we must strive to make equality in education a reality, not just a theory.

Where do you come into the picture? I’ll give you a hint. It has something to do with this wonderful gift that I mentioned earlier, this wonderful education that you’ve received. I’m looking out across this amazing crowd, and I see potential in you. You, as graduates of Kean University have the power of education at your disposal. As the president said, you’re a great equalizer. You have the power to be great leaders. You’re equipped to succeed in your jobs, your hobbies and your relationships. One of the greatest things about education is that it gives you control over your own destiny.

With that in mind, I’m not going to tell you what to do. I will urge you to embrace that control, embrace that autonomy, and use that power for good. Take a look at your resources, your career, your vote, your spare time, your voice, your money, and consider applying some fraction of that towards a good cause that is close to your heart. If you choose to do so, you can make a positive impact on the world

I did the same thing. I took a look at my life, the resources at my disposal, the influence that I have, I took a look at that a few years back and I found my own way to push for change in the world. A few years ago I had the opportunity to travel to Africa and saw firsthand what it was like to live on less than a dollar a day. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I grew up in a blue collar home in western Ohio. My family struggled at times but when I went there I saw what it was really like to live in extreme poverty. That experience inspired me to do something. It inspired me to start the Show Me Campaign, an organization whose mission is to break the cycle of poverty through solutions that have been proven to improve peoples’ lives and to give them the opportunities to survive and to succeed. I believe that education plays a critical role in breaking the cycle of poverty. That’s why the Show Me Campaign fights for people’s access to quality education here in the United States.

The good news is that the solutions are actually out there. We have a plenty of innovators who are working hard to discover solutions to our educational crisis. There are schools all over the country demonstrating that all kids have great potential if they’re given the right opportunities. Right here in New Jersey we have some big reform projects just getting underway.

I’ve had the chance to spend time with one non-profit call Turn Around for Children which is partnered with highly motivated public schools and districts to transform some of the underperforming schools into excellent learning environments. I support Turn Around because they’re providing essential training and support in schools that serve the students who need it the most.

I’m also on the board of the Brooklyn Bridge Academy in New York. They are a phenomenal group of charter schools that are achieving amazing results by hiring and supporting a passionate and talented teaching staff, creating a culture that is highly conducive to learning and setting high expectations for everyone in the building including students, teachers and administrators. These schools are taking kids that normally would go to a normal public school in their neighborhood. These public schools are often dropout factories and these kids come from the same communities as the other kids, from the same parents. These schools spend the same amount of money on the kids per student and they’re achieving dramatically better results. These schools are on a mission and the dramatic rise in test scores and graduation rates show that they are achieving that mission.

If these and other innovative efforts continue, we can make real progress towards repairing our nation’s education system. You can take what was a gift to your generation and make it an enviable right for the next.

While your education here at Kean University does not require you to be a spokesperson for any particular causes you now have the resources, the skills, the privilege, and hopefully the passion to pursue the fulfillment of these rights. I urge you once again, to take that gift and go forth into the world with a mission for good. Find ways to give. Find ways to serve. Find ways to contribute to humanity. I can’t think a way to lead a more meaningful life than that.

Maybe you’ll travel the world. Maybe you’ll make change right here in this area. I’m told that many Kean graduates will go on to be great teachers. Teachers are some of our nation’s most important resources. Every day they help shape the future of this country. Excellent teachers have the power to change lives, to change schools, and to change entire communities. There is no other in school factor that affects student results more than the quality and the effectiveness of their teacher. Teachers are the key. They are the frontline, the key to any educational reform movement.

No matter what profession you choose, you all can make a choice to be aware of what is going on in your community. Choose to pay attention to issues of social justice and choose to make a real difference. Be the inspiration that fills the gap. You have so much power, so much opportunity; make sure this education, this amazing gift, doesn’t go to waste.

Thank you.

Congratulations class of 2011 and your parents too; I know that this was a joint effort. What a legacy this is. What a remarkable sight this is, looking out at you. I am so honored on my husband’s behalf.He would be doubly honored to share this award with his friend and colleague. This is a great day for both of us. My first graduation present to you is that while I was sitting up there I decided cut my speech in half. I know you’ve got your diplomas and let the partying begin.I want to join in that.

Let me just share a few lessons that I’ve learned on the front lines of history with Richard during the past 17 years. Richard believed in the primary importance of American values, American values as a force for good in the world.He was what you might call a muscular liberal.He wanted American power to stand for American decency. He never let the bureaucracies or process hinder his goal. He thought that it was okay to step on some pretty big toes if lives were at stake.His brand of diplomacy had a human face. It was built on trust and respect, not on assertion of power but if that fails he wouldn’t hesitate to summon power. He felt that the only way to break down barriers is by sitting face to face, human to human with your bitterest foe and that’s what he did in the Balkans when he was given his last mission, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He insisted that the president of Afghanistan and Pakistan travel toWashington together and attend all meetings together.Once you know your adversary it’s much harder to demonize him. He liked to say that diplomacy was like jazz; you improvise as you go along, always keeping your goal very clear and using every available tool that you can summon to achieve your goal.If you thought I could be useful he used me and I was happy to be used.

Yeats, one of my favorite poets, once said that “education is not a pale but the lighting of a fire.” Certainly a fire burned brightly inRichard until the last. He did not waste any time and neither must you. Here in one of the world’s great cities, walking its history soaked streets these past years you’ve passed your teachers and your fellow students have surely lit the fire within you.

Fearless now as you go onto the next chapter, remember every original idea seems crazy at the beginning. Be original and trust your instincts and don’t take no for an answer. Especially if the no is followed by, “Well that’s not the way we do business around here.” That’s what Richard was told when he tried to get the European powers to break the deadly siege of Sarajevo, yes by using force as a last resort or later at the United Nations when he pushed the Security Council to deal with the worldwide aids epidemic. We don’t deal with health issues on the Security Council he was told. He prevailed by never giving up and never getting discouraged.

The audacity of determination could well be the title of his biography and maybe someday yours. “There’s no sadder sight,” Mark Twain once said “than a young pessimist.” Pessimists do not change the world. They don’t think it’s worth the trouble but can.

For a number of years I fought for journalists’ rights as the only real safeguard against demagogues and dictators. Whether in the Middle East or in central Europe you simply cannot build genuine democracy without a free and responsible press empowered to rigorously investigate politicians, government officials and businessmen.It’s that simple.

Please note that I use the word responsible when describing the press. Comment is free but facts are sacred. The very famous British editor once said that it is the bravest of the brave who are under fire from Damascus to Tehran, reporters risking all to keep us informed and it is for them that I make interventions through my work at the committee to protect journalists. I do this partly because there was no such organization when the Hungarian secret police arrested my mother and father and sentenced them to long prison terms merely for the crime of being good reporters.

Then that, as now, facts upset dictators. They can even upset countries whose self-image can clash with the truth. I recall how upset we Americans were by the images of torture at American hands in Abu Ghraib. My parents went to prison fighting for the right to report facts just a few decades ago in Europe. We have a great tendency to forget too soon. That’s a mistake. Only history puts event in perspective, people die, and history does not.

For the first time in 2500 years most Europeans live in liberal democracies. For the first time European nations do not ask their citizens to die for their countries. WhenI first returned to this city two decades after my family was forced to flee, my Hungarian friends and I lived in different worlds. Today we share the same world. Our children are indistinguishable from each other in appearance and in their aspirations. This is a wonderful thing but let’s not lose sight of the people, our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents who paid the highest price so that we could live to enjoy this wonderful day together in Budapest.

In my books I try to connect today’s world with our recent history. As a sort of warning bell intolerance on this continent is ever-present and ever dangerous. At the same time a determined man or woman can achieve remarkable things. My husband did. In my book on Raul Wallenberg, the first book I ever wrote,Wallenberg was the hero of Budapest. I focused on the difference that another such man made in standing up to the hate mongers. Wallenberg, like Richard, also stood up to those too cautious bureaucrats who in their way can also lead millions to their death by blindly following inhumane policies.

In my most recent work,Enemies of the People,I burrowed into the archives of the communist secret police to reveal how ordinary decent citizens can be turned into tools of a terrorist state by the most powerful of all weapons, fear.

Facts are the most potent of all weapons and dictators know that. Look at how the Iranian demagogue freely distorts history, denies the Holocaust and how devastating that would be in the absence of documentation to prove that he’s a fabricator.

National identity is a beautiful thing. I still get a lump in my throat when I hear the haunting sound of Hungary’s beautiful national anthem but national identity cannot be a weapon of exclusion in our global village. In the age of a Europe without borders, the internet, instant messaging and face book, it is unimaginable to isolate one people, one nation from any other.

I’m looking at you, a student body of over one hundred nationalities. Friends you made here will be your friends for life. You are strangers no more.The world is your neighborhood. Einstein once said that there are two ways to live your life; one is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. Thank you so much for allowing me to share this day with you. Now please go out there and make a difference.

I am grateful to be given this honor: an honor that is symbolic of the commitment to the arts that Belhaven University, Dr. Roger Parrot, and your Board of Directors have made. You are making a statement; that the arts are fundamental to the core of higher education. The arts are not a peripheral luxury for the elite few, but a central necessity, how a civilization is to be de?ned, and how our humanity is to be restored. The arts, like the spring flowers all about Belhaven this day, bring the aroma of the New.

I have just returned from Japan where I saw first hand the enormous devastation from 3/11—the massive earthquake, the Tsunami, and the ongoing nuclear disaster. I visited the small fishing village of Ishinomaki in northern Japan, a beautiful coastal town swept away by a series of tsunamis, one of which reached 30 meters high. My friend Emiko, who grew up in Ishinomaki, now finds her home and her parents' business gone, though they themselves were spared having been in Tokyo at the time.The aroma—the stench—of death filled the air as I walked about the region. I saw rice fields inundated with salt water, fishing vessels in the middle of streets, trucks still floating in the rivers. After a month, volunteers with masks and orange overalls are still helping residents salvage what they can, helping one house at a time.

One 17-year-old, whose parents and her grandparents were swept away by the Tsunami, returned home to find nothing there worth salvaging, came to the House of Prayer while I was visiting. It was place where a team of missionaries had been giving out basic necessities and they had just set up shower stalls. This met a supreme need for the tsunami-stricken Japanese whose culture celebrates, and needs, cleanliness. I could not imagine what she felt as the hot water washed over her for the first time in a month. I wondered if she could feel the waters at all, or what the waters signified to her.

As I was driven back to Tokyo, we went through Fukushima prefecture, staying far west, away from the dark shadow of the nuclear power plant as much as the road would allow. The Zao mountain range appeared beyond the clouds, with cherry blossoms in full bloom, enchanting the villages tucked away in the crevices between the mountains. It was hard to see scenes of such beauty—of the trunks of the trees, the wet-darkened barks. The disaster was freshly etched in my mind—thousands were still unaccounted for. My heart felt numb and the beauty I now saw seemed cruel.

“April is the cruelest month, breeding

Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing

Memory and desire, stirring

Dull roots with spring rain.”

So begins The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, which he wrote in 1922. April is indeed cruel with the lilacs, or right now in Japan, the cherry blossoms at the highest realm of beauty, invading the “memory and desire” of our war- and tsunami-ravaged heart. We are awakened to horrors and terrors, but Nature does not wait until we stop grieving. It moves on, as does the world, without empathy or knowledge of what really happened. My visit to Japan echoed the lament that Eliot spoke of, where beauty and trauma are forced to dwell together.

Today, you begin a new journey, and for you it is a bright April, full of hope. But we must also remember that for many April has been the “cruelest month.” We must learn to engage with such intractable realities—to engage our creativity within the harsh confines of our broken world and the wide spaces of creating the “world that ought to be.”

My paintings have become a lament of sorts over the years, weaving in and out of our Ground Zero conditions into “The Still Point of the Turning world.” I use the traditional Japanese materials of Nihonga to paint with—pulverized pigments, gold, silver, and platinum. These materials themselves have to be pulverized and pounded to become beautiful. It seems that the refiner’s fire continues to burn, and we have no choice but to go through the process. And in such a journey, every ideology is tested and found wanting. Our faith in God, too, is tested

Zygmunt Bauman, a sociologist, noted that we live in a Liquid Modern time. Post-modernity, he notes, is not solid, but liquid, and constantly shifting. The old allegiances to solidity that we assumed in modernity are now replaced by uncertainty. Our foundations are shifting under us. We have seen in recent times the solidity of our economic system collapse in front of our eyes. We are now facing new questions in the security behind the use of nuclear power facilities. We are finding that in every sphere—in the arts and sciences, business and politics—there has also been a tsunami of sorts. Paradigm shifts are taking place. How many times have we heard the word “unprecedented” in news headlines today? Bauman writes:

“It would be imprudent to deny, or even to play down, the profound change which the advent of ‘fluid modernity’ has brought to the human condition. The remoteness and unreachability of systemic structure, coupled with the unstructured, fluid state of the immediate setting of life-politics, change that condition in a radical way and call for a rethinking of old concepts that used to frame its narratives. Like zombies, such concepts are today simultaneously dead and alive. The practical question is whether their resurrection, albeit in a new shape or incarnation, is feasible; or – if it is not – how to arrange for their decent and effective burial.”

Because of this uncertainty, the insecurity and lack of safety in liquid modern times, we will have to confront increased cynicism and despair. The path of despair is what I am afraid many Japanese will choose in the next years. To give up hope, imbibe despair, and choose to end their lives. If we do not teach our children and ourselves what we imagine and hope for, if we do not seek to define that elusive “world that ought to be,” then the culture of cynicism will define it for us. We are awash in apathy and terror. Thus to create in those waters, we must have more than an optimist’s escapism. Today, to create is to hope. To create is to live.

True Art does not chase after novelty—it is a sensory quest toward the New order of what God is creating, toward fully realized humanity. Using our senses, Art poses deeper questions, rather than giving easy answers. To be truly human in a liquid reality, we must re-define what the culture of fear and cynicism deems as the “world that ought to be.” “The World that Ought” to be is not an utopia; it is instead created out of sacrificial love. To love is to quest for the “World that Ought to Be.” Love is enduring and love uses all of our senses. Love is generative, and will create the stage for the New to appear. The role of the artist in a liquid reality is to awaken all of our senses through creativity and love.

Mary of Bethany, the quintessential artist, brought the extravagant nard to anoint Jesus in John 11, transgressing against the cultural norms of the day. The wedding perfume she poured upon Jesus was the only earthly possession Jesus took to the Cross. That aroma anticipated what is to come. A sacrifice of love co-mingled with the aroma of the New. Aroma created a liquid reality that transcended the chaos of the darkest day of Jesus’ journey. The aroma anticipated a Wedding; a royal, cosmic wedding.

The best of the arts, then, probe through our senses to the “memory and desire,” hovering between life and death, despair and hope. And yet, the best of the arts also point to, or even re-define, the World to come, causing us to rise up, like Lazarus, from the dark tomb of cynicism and despair.

My wife and I recently went to see a production of Our Town by Thornton Wilder at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York City. David Cromer, the founder of the theatre, played the narrator role magnificently. On the spare, dark stage, the famed story of a small New England town was brought to life. One scene in particular stood out to me. It was when young Emily, who died giving birth, is caught somewhere between life and death, ?ghting to recover her memory. She is given the opportunity to move back in time to her 12th birthday.

At this point, the stark colors of the small stage begin to change. And faintly, we in the audience begin to detect an aroma. At first, we think that it is a nearby restaurant cooking their dinner for customers. But the aroma of bacon and eggs continues to ?ll the theatre. The producers had a surprise in store for us. The entire back stage opens up to reveal yet another stage, filled with color and light. Real bacon and real eggs are being cooked by Emily’s mother. Emily’s memory, though fading away, is depicted as more real than the “reality” of the main stage, or even of the gravesite in which the other characters stoically sit. Before Emily returns from her vision to die, she is given, perhaps for the first time, a full experience of Reality—fully engaging our senses in the process.

What if there is a Reality behind the reality we know? What if there is a Stage behind the stage of our life? What if our “memory and desire” points to a greater Reality? What if Emily’s liminal state can be reversed from Death to Life, at least in the audience’s experience? The smell of the bacon is REAL, and poses powerful questions about the nature of reality, and the nature of art.

Of course, the effect on the audience is that we witness Emily’s memories fading away, and we are made to feel the coldness of the earth. She settles comfortably into the graveyard with the others, losing herself in the process. This is a lament of what is lost, what is being washed away. It’s a comment on the modern condition—that even before death, we are sense-less, only half alive.

For Emily, the memory fades. But for the audience, her memory has become a new reality, full of the aroma of the New. That is the power of the arts. The arts can remain a fresh experience, even though the memory and desire fade.

In our liquid time, art needs to become the aroma of bacon and eggs. It is not the art of the novel, but the art of the familiar that awakens our memory of the core essence of our lives, to the morning of our twelfth birthdays. With all solid notions being washed away, as new fears of our days creep into our consciousness, we must insist on reminding people that there is a Stage behind the stage, a Reality behind the reality. But instead of reminding people of the cold earth, we need to awaken the deposit of what is to come. There is a banquet waiting for us beyond the veil. If all is in flux, our task is to touch the fragile earth with the promise of heaven. Create the “still point of the turning world” in the eye of the storm of life. The Gospel of Jesus makes this possible.

Think of John: 21. Here Jesus, in his post-resurrection glory, is cooking breakfast on the beach, and he invites his disciples to partake. Think of the ?sh he is cooking. Where did he get this ?sh? Did he simply create the ?sh at will? Or cause it to jump into his ?re? And he is eating in his post-resurrection body. So was the ?sh resurrected as well? The aroma invites his incredulous disciples to partake, not only in a conversation with the resurrected Savior, but in a meal—a post-resurrection meal. The new Kingdom arrives with an aroma, the aroma of the New.

What the producers of Our Town touched, perhaps unconsciously, was a chord of realization, a hunger, that points to what is to come. The world may call this The World that Ought to Be; C.S. Lewis called it Sehnsucht, a German word that can be translated as “a longing.”

He stated in his essay “The Weight of Glory”:

“For they (art and music) are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.”

I am going to go a bit further than Lewis here. I am convinced that art and music, while not the Thing itself, contain the aroma, the actual aroma, of the New. Artists, whether cognizant of Christ or not, detect this aroma. Bacon and eggs point to that reality. Therefore, you, graduates of Belhaven, have already tasted the aroma of the New. When you dance, when you play your violin, when you draw, what you see, and hear and smell and touch, it all invites you into the aroma of the New. The two worlds, the old and the New, are connected in the arts. Typically, we stop to think about such “idealistic” enchantment and say dismiss it by saying something like, “Well that performance was glorious…but we must now return to reality and do something useful with our lives.” (Or to say, as a performer, seeking some sort of a Utopia, “Oh, we could have done that better.”) Pragmatism will revert us, like Emily in Our Town, back to cold earth and deadened senses.

The World that Ought to be is that which is already imbedded in our senses. God’s hand touches us, even through the cold earth of death and despair, even though we are being washed away in the sea of Liquid Modernity. The Gospel is an aroma, the aroma of the New. And the aroma will reach us, even in the darkest despair.

Tolkien knew of such a world:

“The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.” – Haldir of Lothlorien

Love, my friends, is today mingled with grief. And yet love grows greater. Create in and through that love. Calm the seas of your anxiety and infuse new life deep into the poisoned wells of culture.

“There are many dark places but still there is much that is fair.”

Come and dance, play and paint upon your Ground Zero ashes. That is how we must now love the world. Step into the receding waters filled with poison, but do it with faith. Then the stench of death will be replaced by the aroma of the New. The Stage behind the stage will open up, and instead of being forced to surrender to the cold earth, we will dance upon the waters, hear new sounds, and create new colors.

Let me tell you, it is a pleasure and an honor, yes Chicago, to be with all of you today and I want to thank President Tatum for her leadership and for that very kind and generous introduction.She is such an inspiration to all of the women who are part of the Spelman family. So let’s give her our thanks and a round of applause.

I also want to acknowledge a few people who are here in the audience, Senator Isakson, Representative Johnson, and of course Mayor Reed. Thank you all so much for joining us today. Thank you all for your leadership.

I want to give a special shout out to one of my people, my staff members, Ms.Kristin Jarvis of Spelman class of 2003! Look ladies, want to know what Spelman does for you?Kristin is my right-hand woman. She travels with me all across the country and around the world. I don’t know what I would do without her.She has been with me from the very beginning, looking after my girls and taking care of my mom. So I want to thank Spelman for giving me Kristin.

Again let’s take a moment to thank all of those beautiful people sitting behind you all today, standing behind you every day, the folks who brought you into this world, the folks who showed you with their love that you belong here, they pushed you, they believed in youand they answered calls those late nights even when you were just calling for money. So again let’s get a special round of applause for all the families here today.

Of course most of all to the Spelman class of 2011, congratulations! We’re so proud of you. We’re proud of the effort you’ve invested and the risks that you took. We’re proud of the bonds that you forged the growth that you’ve showed. We’re proud of how for the past four years you’ve immersed yourselves in the life of the school and embraced and all that it has to offer.

In doing so you didn’t just write a chapter in your own life story, you also became part of the Spelman story, a story that began 130 years ago about 10 miles down the road from where we are today.

By now all of you know the details about how two white women from up north came here to Atlanta to establish the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary.

We want the world to know this story. They started out in a dank church basement loaned to them by a kindly preacher named Father Quarrels. In their first class they had just 11 students, many of whom were former slaves.

Back then the thought of an African American woman learning to read and write was to so many laughable at best and impossibility at worst. A plenty of people tried to persuade them from founding the school. They said the south was too dangerous. They said that at the ages of 56 and 48, these women were too old. These two ladies were unmoved.In their own words, they were determined to lift up these women and girls who never had a chance. It’s a story that has been told and retold, enacted and reenacted in every generation since the day that Spelman first opened its doors.

In a time of black codes and lynching this school was training AfricanAmerican women to be leaders in education and health professions. In a time of legalized segregation this school was establishing math and biology departments and training a generation of black women scientists. At a time when many workplaces were filled with not just glass ceilings but brick walls, this school was urging black women to become doctors and lawyers, engineers and ambassadors.

Now that is the story of Spelman College, that unyielding presumption of promise, that presumption of brilliance, that presumption that every woman who enrolls at the school has something infinitely valuable to offer this world.

Ladies, that is now your story. That legacy is now your inheritance. I chose that word inheritance very carefully because it’s not an entitlement that you can take for granted, a gift with which you can do whatever you please. It is a commitment that comes with a certain set of obligations, obligations that don’t end when you march through that arch today.

That’s really what I want to talk with you about this afternoon.I want to talk to about the obligations that come with the Spelman education and how I believe you all might fulfill those obligations going forward.

So let’s go back to those first 11 women in that church basement all those years ago. Their teachers started with nothing but a couple of bibles, notebooks and pencils. When it rained it got so damp in that church that grass started growing on the floor. Often the stove was so smoky and the light was so poor that students could barely see their teachers.

Still a week after week more women showed up to enroll. Some walked eight or nine miles each way; many were older, in their 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. That doesn’t sound old to me. Often they were ridiculed but they kept coming.

One student and her name was Mary Ambrooks simply stated, and these are her words, “I spoke of going to school and people laughed at me and said, ‘You go to school? You’re too old. You’re so old you’ll die there.’ I told them it was just as good a place to die in as I ever wanted. I knew that the teachers would bury me and so I just came right along.”

Now that spark, that spirit, that odds defying tenacity has defined the alumni of this school from its very first graduating class. Think about one of my heroines, Mary Wright Edelman, class of 1960, working as a young civil rights lawyer down in Mississippi. Attorneys and judges chambers refused to shake her hand. The sheriff locked the doors against her when she came to visit her clients in jail. She was always careful to leave the door open when she started her car in the morning, that way if somebody had planted a car bomb she had a chance of being injured rather than killed. Through it all she continued to represent her clients. She continued to resist unjust laws with every fiber of her being.

Then there’s JanetBragg, class of 1925, who was determined to be a pilot. When she was barred from flying out of segregated airports she worked with her flying school classmates and instructors to build their own airfield. When she was rejected from the women air force service pilots because of her race she enrolled in a civilian training program instead. When she completed her training but an instructor unfairly prevented her from receiving her license she picked up and moved to Chicago passed the exam and became the first African American woman to earn a commercial pilot’s license. Of her experiences she said, there were so many things they said women couldn’t do and blacks couldn’t do, every defeat to me was a challenge.

For six generations that is what Spelman women have done. They have seen every defeat as a challenge. Did they have moments of doubt, anxiety and fear? Did they have moments of despair when they thought about giving up or giving in?

Of course they did; we all do. I am no exception. Some of you may have grown up like me, in neighborhoods where few had the chance to go to college, where being teased for doing well in school was a fact of life, where well-meaning but misguided folks questioned whether a girl with my background could get into a school like Princeton. Sometimes I saved them the trouble and raised the questions myself, in my own head, lying awake at night, wondering whether I had what it took to succeed.

The truth is that there will always be folks out there who make assumptions about others. There will always be folks who try to raise themselves up by cutting other people down. That happens to everyone including me throughout their lives but when that happens to you all here’s what I want you to do. I want you to just stop a minute, take a deep breath, because it’s going to need to be deep, and I want you to think about all those women who came before you.

Thank you Marilyn, President Rabinowitz, honored guests and fellow Hofstra graduates!

They’ve asked me today to give you some advice about life. I’ve given this a great deal of time and thought and here it is: keep drinking.

You made it through college this way, you’ve graduated, I say keep up the good work. Celebrate today. Celebrate tonight. Then put the bottle down.Put the other stuff down too, and really live your life, which is something you can’t do if you’re lying on the floor. And when I say live your life, I mean live your life.

The best advice I ever got from anyone about anything was from a creator of great television shows like Mary Tyler Moore and The Cosby Show. His name was Ed Weinberger and this is what he said, “Do the show you want to do, because in the end, they’re going to cancel you anyway.” This became not only how I ran my show, but my philosophy of life. We’re all going to get cancelled one day. So do the show you want to do.

That doesn’t mean it will be easy. And maybe it’s not supposed to be.When I was a kid watching too much television, I didn’t know there was writing, directing and producing. I was watching “The Honeymooners”, and I just wanted to be those guys, I wanted to be funny on stage. That’s all I wanted. And so I did all the shows in High School and then I came to a college that was known for having a great theater department called Hofstra University.

My first impressions in 1977.. Hempstead. Giant looming concrete towers, I checked into Tower E and finding my room, I say my room, but I shared the 10 by 20 cell with two other shocked teenagers, we were impressed to learn that our rooms had recently been vacated by team members of the New York Jets, who used to practice over there and had just used our dorms as their dorms. You could tell where they slept, because our beds were caved in, as if elephants had decided to take naps in Tower E.

I had a lot of fun here. I ate terrible food on the meal plan here. I made friends for life here, got to be in a lot of plays and struck out with a lot of girls. But, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Fine Artsdegree in Theater, I was ready for life, real life. A life where just showing that theater degree and saying “I’m an actor” opened every door in New York City. Now I know a lot of you have carefully planned for the future, and your proud parents are here today, ready to help you, and sacrifice even further for you. Some of them, because they love you so much, have asked me to pass on a message to you: Please don’t move back in with us.

I say this to my kids as well. I mean, listen, us parents, we used to be kids. We went to school. We graduated. We struggled. But when we could finally support ourselves, we used to do whatever we wanted, we’d go out, party, take trips whenever we wanted, buy a house, do whatever we wanted with those rooms in that house and then you came along. Now this doesn’t mean we don’t love you, doesn’t mean we’ve stopped deeply caring. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t call or visit often. It’s just, we put a hot tub in that room. And besides, how will you ever have any self-esteem if you don’t do things for yourself?

That’s what my parents said to me. My terrific parents are here today, Max and Helen Rosenthal. I owe everything I am today. They didn’t want me back, they told me so, and I was going to show them. I had enough self-esteem not to move back in with my father and mother. Right after graduation, I moved in with my grandmother.

That’s true. The German word for grandmother is “Oma”. My Oma, or as we called her “Crazy Oma,” lived in a not so good neighborhood in Washington Heights, Manhattan, but, it was a huge 2-bedroom place. She was a tough and yes, crazy, old German lady who greeted me in a green bathrobe with curlers in her hair and a big soup ladle in her hand.

This was my roommate. I thought that since the old apartment was so big, we could go weeks without seeing each other. I thought that I could come and go as I pleased and still not have to pay rent. I thought this was a good idea. I didn’t know I would actually have to pay with my soul. Crazy Oma had rules in her house. She did not enjoy visitors, or people of any kind, really. I was not allowed to leave the apartment without my clothing passing inspection and my hair was brushed, often against my will. Every meal was to be eaten at home, cooked by Crazy Oma. Every meal involved some kind of cold cuts from the neighborhood butcher. The name of the butchers was, “Bloch and Falk”. Sounds appetizing yes? I remember baloney looking mystery meats with the big white splotches of fat in it. Then the murky, salty German soups that tasted like the ocean. One night I took a sip and stared at my spoon. There was a hair curler in it. I even started to miss the Student Center.I lasted two weeks at Crazy Oma’s. I knew I had to move out on my own or I was going to kill Crazy Oma and sell her body to Bloch and Falk.

So I did move out, to another Washington Heights apartment, with another Hofstra graduate or two or three or four, and we made our way. The first job I got with my new degree in Theater was phone sales, cold calling. I sold farm and implement cleaner in a boiler room set up on Park Ave South.

My script began, “Congratulations, you’ve won a television!” This was usually followed by someone suggesting that I please enjoy myself, though not in those exact words.I tried to get auditions, and I ate tuna fish for dinner most nights. The next job I got was as a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I worked the graveyard shift; that’s midnight to eight in the morning. I thought I could do this. I was fired from the Metropolitan Museum of Art for falling asleep on a 300 year old bed. It’s all true.

My next job was managing a deli at 70th and 3rd, called PJ Bernstein’s, for a nice man named Lou. I enjoyed the deli. I gained 15 pounds but I came to work one day and work was closed. The lights were off, the chairs were up and the door was locked. The guy from the store next door came out and said sweetly, “You look for Lou? Ha, ha. He run away. He owe everybody money, the milk man, fish man, meat man. You don’t see him again. Ha HaHa. Hey, you are the famous stupid boy who fall asleep in the museum! Ha… stupid”

I went home hungry that night. At least I had tuna fish. But when I got home I discovered that one of my roommates had given my last can of tuna to his cat. I got into my little bed with that day’s newspaper and opened it to see a big, full page ad for a big Long Island college, “Hofstra University. We teach Success.”

“Hm, I said to myself. I must have been out that day”. But even though I was pretty hungry, a little lonely, a lot frustrated, I was young and I actually remember thinking to myself, I have a place to live, I have a television and “At least I get to pursue what I want”.

That’s something not to take for granted, the actual pursuit of happiness. Then my apartment was robbed and they got my television.

I bet you graduates are now wondering, “Why is this guy telling me all this?” And the parents are going, “Not exactly an ad for living out there on your own, thanks “doctor”".

It gets worse.Right around this time, some other actor friends of mine, who were in the same, leaky boat, asked me to help write a show for all of us to be in. We did, and that show became very successful. We had literally written our own ticket, a great lesson. But then egos got involved and backstage backbiting and greed and jealousy and I was fired from the very hit show I had helped create, by people I thought were my friends.

This was a real welcome to the real world, and it was the absolute lowest point in my life. Lower even than being on the Hofstra meal plan. I could have sued these people. I had grounds to sue them but I had no money, so I did the poor man’s version of suing. I got incredibly depressed.

A talent agent had seen me in the show and said, “If you come to Hollywood, you will never stop working as an actor. So I packed a bag and flew to Hollywood and I never started working as an actor. I started writing, with another friend of mine who wanted to break into sitcoms. We had to write a sample scripts. We didn’t know what to write about.

At the time there was a popular TV show called “Roseanne”, and I thought, what if her husband had to take a job at night as a security guard in a museum and he gets fired for falling asleep on a 300 year old bed? That’s what we wrote and agents and studio people started reading this and saying “what an imagination!” I went from being an actor who ate tuna fish for dinner, to eating whatever he wanted. And then I got jobs on terrible shows, like a sitcom for Robert Mitchum. Ask your parents who’s Robert Mitchum and they’ll say “no one who should be in a sitcom”. Then some more terrible shows and then not so terrible shows, and then I met a guy named Raymond, and I wrote a show for him. I put a lot of my family stuff into that show and at first, got a lot of notes from a lot of executives. I would listen to these notes, and consider them carefully, and then I did the show I wanted to do. I got to do that show for 9 years and now I’m a doctor.

The point is, when I was here at Hofstra, taking all the classes they made me take that I knew I’d never use, English, Play Analysis, Art History, all those essays I had to write, and then when I was out there on my own, suffering, I had no idea what it was all for. I wish someone had told me, “Your degree will be good for something, just maybe not what you thought originally. If you’re open to it, sometimes life presents you with what you’re supposed to be”. So that’s why I’m here today you beautiful people. I wish for you, what I had.

Real life and what that will lead to. I found a reaI life and the best part of that real life, I found real love, not just in my work, but in my beautiful bride Monica, also something I got from Hofstra,you may recognize her as Amy, the brother’s wife on Raymond. There’s an interesting story how she got the part, she slept with the producer; we were already married so it was very unusual. She’s now the Mom of our two spectacular kids Ben who’s 16 and Lily who’s 13 and who will not be living with us. I’m going to encourage them, and you, even though it might be scary, to go out and live your life, go through the hard times and take notes. Maybe you’ll write about them someday. Pursue happiness, find love, find out what you’re meant to be, be nice, be generous, leave a good tip, support your school, support the arts, brush your hair and floss your teeth, hold on to your friends, especially your college friends, and even if you have to stay with your folks for a little while, its ok, but don’t ever move back, move front.

You can do it. You will do it. You’re Hofstra Graduates! Do the show you want to do! Have a drink!

So, ladies and gentlemen of the Class of 2011 –today you’re on the brink, about to cross over….

Last week, you had projects and deadlines and meetings and not a second to spare… And next week? Well, for many of you next week will be luxuriously relaxed with just a touch, or for some of you maybe more than a touch of ”Uh Oh” because your tomorrows may be looking just a bit too relaxed, just a little bit too “I don’t know what’s next-ish” than you’d like and that’s  what I want to talk about today.

I want to talk to you about your tomorrows in journalism….

It is, I know, hard to find a job.

I’m guessing you look at the world of newspapers and magazines and broadcasters and webcasters and Huffposts and Daily Beasts and sometimes the whole bunch of ’em feel like the City of Troy – you know,  this high walled, Fortress of Journalism, occupied by people who somehow got in before you did and now they’re looking down at you… little you, a newbie standing alone on the beach  and you’re looking up,  thinking: “Hey! How’d you get in there?… and they’re not telling…

But the question’s still a good one:  How these days does anybody get a good job in journalism, a job where you are surrounded by good people, people you envy and admire, people like the folks you just spent two years with at this school? (I mean not all of them –but I imagine that each of you now have one or two or maybe three friends that you made here that you know are good at what they do, and sometimes better than good… and sometimes better than you. )

So how do you taste more of what you tasted here, which (if I can presume) includes the thrill of occasionally writing a good sentence, of asking exactly the right question at the right moment, of making two pieces of tape fit perfectly together, of getting to meet new people, go new places, see things unfold… these little satisfactions of journalism… how can you have more of that?

That’s all you’re asking, right? That’s all you want. That, and a salary.

And yet it seems so hard right now.

You can send resumes, you can phone friends. You can phone friends of friends, call up people and try to make a quick impression, but does that get you the job? For some of you, yes.  Some of you, not yet.

It took 10 years for those Greeks to figure a way into Troy… ten years on the friggin’ beach until finally the cleverest guy in the group – the “wily’ Ulysses – figured out a way, involving an oversized horse, which makes you wonder: how wily do you have to be to get a job?

What if – and here’s a horrible thought – that because you were born in 1980, or 82, 85, 87, graduating into a job-stricken, wildly changing economy… maybe you’re just doomed.

Some of you must be thinking that—and for you who are, and to your parents, I say: No, no, and no.

I am here to tell you, that you are stepping into a world that is riper, more pregnant with newness, new ideas, new beats, new opportunities than most generations of journalists before you. You are lucky to be you, very lucky, though you may not be feeling it at the moment.

So let me tell you a feel-bad story that should make you feel good.

It’s about a guy who got a job as a correspondent at CBS News, in its day, the best place in the world to work. And he got it at the age of 23. He’d had a short stint at the Charlotte News in North Carolina; he’d written some good pieces and got a call… literally, he got called and was asked to come to the CBS Building, then on Madison Avenue in New York, where he was offered a writing job on the spot. These things actually happened. And because he was fast, a natural stylist with a keen eye, it happened to Charles Kuralt. That was his name, Charles Kuralt.

And he knew how lucky he was…because at that first job interview, as he walked from the elevator to the guy he was supposed to talk to, on his way down the hall, he passed a door – it was closed, but on it, lettered in gold, were the words “Mr. Murrow”, as in Edward R. Murrow, who was at that moment the anchor of the evening newscast. And when he was hired as a writer there, he could looked around at the mailboxes with names on them that in those days, those names, you may not know them now, but those names back then were legends: Eric Serveried, Charles Collingwood, Richard C. Hottelet, Daniel Shorr, Robert Trout.  This was friggin unbelievable: to be one of Murrow’s boys – at 23 – when you practically ARE a boy! Oh my god.

And then, not too long after, he had his big break.

As I say, he was a news writer, writing copy off in a corner, sometimes for Murrow, but he’s pretty much an indoors guy, and he’s dreaming of course, of getting outdoors where things are happening and one night – in the middle of the night, on the graveyard shift, two a.m.—the bell on the wire ticker goes off and says an airplane has just fallen short of the runway at LaGuardia Airport and is sinking in the East River, right now.

And Kuralt and the night editor flip a coin for who’s going to go, Charles wins and runs downstairs, jumps into a cab and says “Take me To LaGuardia.” The problem is, no sooner are they out of the midtown tunnel, then the cab gets snarled in some weird pre dawn, fire engines-heading-to-the-airport  traffic jam, so Kuralt leaps out, and starts running through the tangled cars up the highway when he sees a guy on a motorcycle weaving his way through the traffic, so he waves his hands wildly, flags him down, says he’s a news reporter, there’s a plane in the water, he’s on deadline, “take me!” and the motorcycle guy jerks his thumb at the saddle on his bike, says “Hold On’   and then, like a stunt driver, zigzags through the cars to the airport and Kuralt is one of the first on the scene, where he climbs over fences, gets the interviews, and makes it onto the evening news. After which he’s anointed “correspondent”, the youngest ever…at 23.

Charles Kuralt not only could write nicely. He had a voice and a calm and a style that was… well, let’s just say when I got to CBS, I felt about Charles Kuralt they way Kuralt felt about Edward R. Murrow… I thought he was remarkable. There have been few reporters in my lifetime that I admired more.

So fast forward 40 years… to 1990 or so. Now I am on the same floor with Kuralt, right next door. And I liked to wander into his office because, well, because, it felt like a privilege. Every time I walked through his door I felt that I had a hall pass to yak with Zeus, if only I could disguise my… well, my admiration… I liked him so…

So on one particular day, it was a late fall afternoon, near to Thanksgiving, and the sun was low in the sky and when I walked in Charles was at his desk, sitting there, back lit by the sun, like a saint. And at first all I could see was his silhouette… but when my eyes adjusted, it was strange. He was holding what looked like a reefer between his thumb and index finger (which wasn’t a habit I would ever associate with Charles).  It was rolled, like a joint, very tight, but I could tell this bit of paper had been carved out of the front page of a Wall Street Journal that was lying on his desk. He had seen something on that front page, and he had, with his pen, drawn a circle around it so many times – over and over – that the piece had come loose and he’d taken this fragment and twisted it into this skinny little shape… and when I walked in, he put the twisted thing down on his desk top, all alone, then he looked at me, got up, a little unsteadily, he pointed to the paper, and then he left the room.

And I wondered, What is it? What’s he got?  So I looked at the paper, and on the front page there was a story about CBS. This was a while ago, so I may not have all the details right, but it seems that CBS had paid a huge hunk of money to get a new station manager to work at WBBM, their premier Chicago station… and the story of this producer was that he had been hired by a Miami station that was very low rated, nobody watched it, until this guy, who’s name I don’t remember any more, got the idea to hire very buff, very curvey, very news-delicious newscasters, both men and women, and have them deliver many of their reports from the beach, often in beach wear and sometimes, from in the water, where they got kind of wet, showing  off their extra beautiful parts, and the station in a multi-station market had leapt from a, you know 6 percent share to something miraculous, like a 50 percent share. Half the people in Miami who were watching news on television were now watching this guy’s station… and when I opened the little twisted bit of paper, Charlie’s reefer, the paragraph that he had circled over and over, that paragraph said that CBS, Edward R. Murrow’s CBS, Charlie Kuralt’s CBS, had just hired this guy to be the new station manager.

And that’s when Charles came back into the room, and slumped down in his chair and looked at me like a man who had lost a friend. Or like a man betrayed. And the thing is, as I tell you this story now, I’m sure a lot of you are thinking, “Of course. CBS is a business and if a business can get a 50 share of a market, (If any business can get a fifty percent share of any market, if there’s a way to do that….) you’ve gotta know someone’s going to try. Maybe it’ll work, maybe it won’t.  Beachwear in Chicago can be a little tricky come October, but come on, this isn’t shocking, this is what businesses do.

But when Charles Kuralt went to CBS, it wasn’t a business. It was a calling. It had saints. It had heroes. It had character. And it protected its own. If you went into battle, in World War 2 or in Korea or in Vietnam, for CBS, and you found yourself under fire, in harm’s way, if you survived, you were honored the way soldiers honor each other. Charles and his cameraman Freddy Deitrich, had been fired on Vietnam. They were caught in an ambush, and a soldier they’d been covering, a Lieutenant Son, from the South Vietnamese Army had come over to see if they were ok and at that moment, a sniper shot Son through the head and he fell right where Kuralt was. Right next to him.

After that, Kuralt knew, because this is how it worked back then… everybody at CBS  would remember his service, would remember what he’d risked to get a story and after that, he pretty much had a lifetime contract. Even if, later, they didn’t like you that much, they wouldn’t fire you. I’m not saying CBS was always honorable. It wasn’t. I’m not saying it was always noble. It wasn’t. But it did offer men like Kuralt a deal: It said to you: “Give us your heart, give us your best years, and we will protect you. We will pay you. We will keep you. And you will part of us. And you will be proud to be part of us.”

And Charles Kuralt bought that deal hook, line and sinker, but then – on the afternoon I’m talking about… in the 1990s, after a bunch of ownership and management shuffles, by the time he read that story in the Wall Street Journal, he knew that the bloom was off his rose, that CBS was becoming, like so many companies before and after, a place where they would go for the quick fix, hire the hottie, then fire the hottie, love you on Monday, leave you on Thursday, or maybe even Wednesday… or Tuesday, and he hadn’t seen it coming. He had believed in Murrow. He just didn’t believe in this.

And I remember saying to him on that day… in that office, me on my side of his desk, and him on his side, in the setting sun… “Here’s the difference, Charles, between my generation and yours. Here’s what my friends will never do, that you and your friends DID do: we will never trust a company that hires us, no matter how good, how proud it is at this moment, to stay loyal to us. To protect us. We will never put our faith in a corporation, even a good one. We can’t. Because everything we know tells us that we will be disappointed. That we are vulnerable. And you, sitting here, are just another example of what my friends already know.”

Though I’ll tell you… thinking of him hitching a ride on a motorcycle, gunning his way down the Grand Central Parkway from a plane crash, clasping the hottest story of the day to his chest and taking it home to Mr. Murrow, a young news gladiator working for the best company on earth… it would be so wonderful to be able to walk into a place and not have to worry again about anything but your work. But that world has vanished. Poof!

Which is only to say that the notion that if you could get yourself into the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CBS, NBC, Time, Newsweek, they’d take you in, teach you,  protect you….

Those days – first, didn’t last long…

Maybe one, one and a half generations got that deal.

And for you, the generation after me, I’ll say to you what I said to my hero, Charles:

You can’t trust big companies to keep you safe.

I know most of you don’t and I’m just here to remind you: A job at NBC, ESPN, New York Times, NPR, may look safe today – but things change. They always change. And companies won’t protect you from that change. They can’t. And these days, they don’t even try.

Which brings me back to where I started.

If you want to make a life in this business, if you want to begin, and survive and flourish, how do you do it?

How do you start?

Well I think there’s a way.

There’s always a way, but lately I’ve noticed a pattern emerging. And I’ve seen it work for a number of people who are close to your age… I’ve watched them step from obscurity… to notice… to a little money… and then to a actual salary, following this route.

It isn’t easy.

But here’s what I’ve noticed.

Some people when they look for a job in journalism ask themselves, What do I like to do and Who can take me there? Who can get me to a war zone? To a ballpark? To Wall Street? To politicians, to movie stars? Who’s got the vehicle? And you send them your resume and you say, “I want a seat in your car.” … And you wait.

But there are some people, who don’t wait.

I don’t know exactly what going on inside them; but they have this… hunger. It’s almost like an ache.

Something inside you says I can’t wait to be asked I just have to jump in and do it.

I was one of those people. When I was a teenager I loved political conventions. My mom watched them on TV, she was really into politics, so I watched with her… and there was something about nominating conventions… all those senators and mayors and political bosses in a huge, blazing room with the banners and balloons and funny hats, choosing and bargaining, will it be Kennedy or Stevenson, the cameras, the lights, the drama, I just… when I got a little older… I just wanted to see it for myself.

So at age 20, I think it was, and this is just really kind of crazy behavior, I decided I’d just go. There was a political convention in Chicago in 1967, one year before the riots in 68. It was a political convention for left wing anti-war activists planning to nominate Dr. Martin Luther King and Dr. Benjamin Spock the world famous baby doctor/pediatrician as President and Vice President… it was called The New Politics Convention. And I thought, I’m going to go and “cover” that convention.

I had no idea what it meant to “cover” anything…except that when you watched real reporters on TV… I noticed they all had “credentials”, something impressive hanging around their necks. So, to prepare, I went to Art Brown’s Art Supply store in New York and got some pre-inked letters, called LettraSet , cause in those days no one had  printers and fonts at home. All you had was a typewriter, and no one’s going to fall for a credential that’s typed. No. So,  for $2.50, I got myself a sheet of pre-inked Bodoni bold letters, fifty a’s, fifty b’s fifty c’s…and letter by letter, rubbing with a stylus, I forged an I.D. for some reason from the Yale Daily News.

I didn’t go to Yale. I went to Oberlin College. I was on the Oberlin paper. But some sick impulse told me Oberlin wouldn’t be impressive enough, so I painstakingly created a Yale Press card with a Yale logo and made up all these different looking signatures with different colored pens, and I then laminated the thing, twice. I thought lamination was crucial. The more plastic you had around your ID, the more credible the forgery and when I walked into the Hilton Hotel in Chicago I was looking pretty good…except for the fact that the Yale Daily news had actually sent a reporter to this convention, he later became an undersecretary of state, Strobe Talbot, and he was two people behind me on the registration line when we were waiting to get in, so for the next three days,  I had to constantly make sure that Strobe Talbot and I were never, ever in the same room… But the thing is: they let me in. And I just… did it. I learned what reporters do by watching them, and then copying what I saw.  I ran up corridors. I interviewed people. I took frantic notes. I’d rush from ballrooms to the convention pressroom and type like crazy, what exactly I don’t remember, cos nobody had sent me there; I was writing nothing to nobody.  It was a pantomime, the whole thing, but I was in heaven. At one point there was a fight in a corridor, while the fight was still going on – and this was Chicago, people really hit each other – I squirreled on my belly underneath the fighting  to get a quote from the first victim, whose name happened to be Maliewsky, or some long Polish name with lots of vowels, not easy to spell but I knew everybody would want to know the right spelling – I’d just learned that – so lying on the floor I say to him, “How do you spell Maliewsky? M, A, L, I or is it E? and with his head pressed to the carpet, he tells me, and I squiggle back out, and ten minutes later I’m standing in the pressroom… once I was sure Strobe Talbot wasn’t there, and I’m spelling Maliewsky and then, generously I’m…. sharing my quote! Oh man.

When I went home, by total chance, I was seated on the plane back to New York (which cost, by the way, in those days, 30 dollars if you were under 22)  next to none other than  Dr.Benjamin Spock, the now anointed vice presidential nominee. So I had an exclusive interview with THE GUY! It was an exclusive for nobody… but still… I was so excited, we shared a cab back downtown and I left my clothes in his cab. The next day, my mother called me (cause my parents’ address was on the bag) and she said, “Do you know Dr. Spock? Cause he just left your clothes in our lobby.” And there was no way I could tell my mother what I’d done. No way.

I still have trouble explaining to myself. I just wanted to be there. And, I should tell you I wasn’t, like, planning a career or dreaming dreams of a life in journalism. In fact, I had just seen Gregory Peck in To Kill A Mockingbird and I wanted to be him. A trial lawyer, that was my dream. So after college and national service I went to law school.  Journalism wasn’t my first love… or my only love, but the seed was planted. And then later, when I graduated law school and had this deep, haunting feeling that I’d made a mistake, and I’d didn’t have the talent or the character to be Gregory Peck,  then asked myself… well, what can I do? What am I good at? And I thought, well, I’m good at explaining things… I like learning stuff and meeting people and who gets to do that? And I remembered my weekend in Chicago…

And the thing is, at that moment, after law school, I was desperate to be good at something, and Journalism, I thought, might save me from being a nobody.

And, because I’d had that crazy weekend, I had a sly feeling, maybe it could be better than that. Some combination of desire and desperation gave me my next plan: I went to my living room, with a tape recorder and I composed a ten part series about Presidential Impeachments. Richard Nixon was being investigated by Congress at that time… this was the Watergate era, and I just wrote ten questions I thought might be on peoples’ minds:

If a president is impeached does he go right to jail? No. He goes on trial.

Who runs the trial? Who’s the judge?

Who’s the jury?

If Senators are supposed to weigh the evidence like jurors, what if 6 of them are in the bathroom during important testimony. Normal Jurors can’t go to the bathroom, but I bet Senators can?

Who is Nixon’s lawyer?

Who is the prosecutor?

Does the President go to work when he’s being impeached?

And so on…

And I took all these questions, and because I’d gone to law school, I answered them and performed a question and answer 40 minute drama, for some reason, in the style of Howard Cosell, the great ABC sportscaster. Why I did my impeachment lesson as a sportscast, I have no idea. It was not a… uh… big success, But one radio station, a community, underground,  lefty kind of station, found it curiously plausible. And that’s all it took, one. That tape got me my first job…

But the impulse, to explain, to write, to tell, began here… [tapping heart] On my insides.

Journalism doesn’t have to be your first love… or your only love.

You can come to it in desperation, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life, that it’s this or the abyss.

But once you get going… it helps if you love it. There are different things to love. Some of you, no doubt, have learned to love the spotlight, you want to be the narrator… the on-camera, the presenter, the voice, the big byline.

Others of you may choose producing, designing, managing, staying out of sight, shaping the product.

Some of you like speed. Find something, get it right, get it on, go home. Some of you like it slower:  go somewhere, hang out, mull it over, write a draft… take your time…

What you love can differ, but the love, once it comes, that feeling of waking up with a kind of eagerness, a crazy momentum that pushes you into your day, an excitement you realize you don’t ever want to go way… that’s important.

If you don’t have that feeling, maybe you’re lucky. You can lead a more sane life.  But if you do – I say congratulations. You have what it takes to begin.

What you do next? Well, the obvious option is to go to Conde Nast, Sports Illustrated, MTV.  They’re there. You can go in and pour coffee for the person who sharpens the pencil for the person who writes the copy and work your way all the way to the top. That’s what Charles Kuralt did. And in his day, with his talent, he did it very fast.

But here’s another way.

It’s not easy. It’s not for everybody. Just something to think about.

Suppose, instead of waiting for a job offer from the New Yorker, suppose next month, you go to your living room, sit down, and just do what you love to do. If you write, you write. You write a blog. If you shoot, find a friend, someone you know and like, and the two of you write a script. You make something. No one will pay you. No one will care, No one will notice, except of course you and the people you’re doing it with. But then you publish, you put it on line, which these days is totally doable, and then… you do it again.

Now I understand that if you’re married, or have a kid, you can’t not make money. And I know that it is not fun, it’s the opposite of fun, to juggle rent payments with car payments, to fudge medical bills, to play roulette with your credit cards, to have bills that must be paid month after month after month, that don’t go down, and I know about friends and siblings who didn’t go crazy, who didn’t try to become professional storytellers, who became normal things, like sales people, and doctors and teachers  and are now moving into homes, buying real furniture and making you feel like you are slipping backwards in the world for the sin of  following a dream. I know about that.

But let me tell you what I’ve also seen.

I’ve also seen, in my most recent area, science journalism, I’ve seen people do just what I’ve proposed. I’ve seen people, literally, go home, write a blog about dinosaurs (in one case), neuroscience, biology. Nobody asked them. They just did. On their own. By themselves.

After they wrote, they tweeted and facebooked and flogged their blogs, and because they were good, and worked hard, within a year or two, magazines asked them to affiliate (on financial terms that were insulting), but they did that, and their blogs got an audience, and then they got magazine assignments, then agents, then book deals, and now, three, four years after they began, these folks, five or six of them, are beginning to break through. They are becoming not just science writers with jobs, they are becoming THE science writers, the ones people read, and look to… they’re going places. And they’re doing it on their own terms! In their own voice, they’re free to be themselves AND they’re paid for it!

How they managed, I don’t know. Some of them worked by day and wrote by night.

Some lived with their parents. Some must have struck deals with spouses or with friends.

But I notice, because I talk to them, and now I often work with them… I notice that they get courage from each other. They’ve got a kind of community. At first it was virtual; they wrote each other. Then they met each other. Now they support each other. Watch out for each other. One day, I imagine, they will get and give each other jobs. And they share a sensibility, a generational sense, that this is how “we” do it.

News, after all, is a spin of words and pictures. It’s a kind of music. There are beats in a newscast, a newspaper story. Ed Murrow sounded like Ed Murrow. Huntley and Brinkley sounded different.  Anderson Cooper, different still. When you grow up in different decades, you laugh at different jokes, hear different machines, (typewriters versus computers, pinball machines versus Mario Brothers), you hear different ads, jingles, songs, sounds.

When you talk or write or film, you work with the music inside you, the music that formed you. Different generations have different musics in them, so whatever they do, it’s going to come out differently and it will speak in beats of their own generation.

The people in charge, of course, don’t want to change. They like the music they’ve got.  To the newcomers, they say, “Wait your turn”.

But in a world like this… rampant with new technologies, and new ways to do things, the newcomers… that means you… you here today, you have to trust your music… It’s how you talk to people your age, your generation. This is how we change.

After all, when it began in the 1930’s, Time, the weekly news magazine, was a radical idea created by young Henry Luce and his college friends. The New Yorker got its beats from young James Thurber and his buddy E.B. White, and their boss Harold Ross, I was at Rolling Stone when Jann Wenner put together his amazing gang of writers, designers, critics, photographers. Then Ira Glass did it again with Gen Xers. Each of these groups have a shared feel; they are expressing something that belongs to their age, their time.

So for this age, for your time, I want you to just think about this: Think about NOT waiting your turn.

Instead, think about getting together with friends that you admire, or envy.  Think about entrepeneuring. Think about NOT waiting for a company to call you up. Think about not giving your heart to a bunch of adults you don’t know. Think about horizontal loyalty. Think about turning to people you already know, who are your friends, or friends of their friends and making something that makes sense to you together, that is as beautiful or as true as you can make it.

And when it comes to security, to protection, your friends may take better care of you than CBS took care of Charles Kuralt in the end. In every career, your job is to make and tell stories, of course. You will build a body of work, but you will also build a body of affection, with the people you’ve helped who’ve helped you back.

And maybe that’s your way into Troy.

There you are, on the beach, with the other newbies, looking up. Maybe somebody inside will throw you a key and let you in… But more likely, most of you will have to find your own Trojan Horse.

And maybe, for your generation, the Trojan Horse is what you’ve got, your talent, backed by a legion of friends. Not friends in high places. This is the era of Friends in Low Places. The ones you meet now, who will notice you, challenge you, work with you, and watch your back. Maybe they will be your strength.

If you choose to go this way, you won’t have Charles Kuralt’s instant success. It will take time. It will probably be very lonely. A living room is not a news room. It doesn’t feel like one. You know you’re alone. And on the way, you might get scarily close to not being able to afford a living room.

But what I’ve noticed is that people who fall in love with journalism, who stay at it, who stay stubborn, very often win. I don’t know why, but I’ve seen it happen over and over.

So, here, for what it’s worth, ladies and gentlemen of the Class of 2011, is my graduation advice. Some of you will say, “This is a fantasy. Pay this man no attention,” but hey, you invited me, so here’s what I’ve got:

If you can… fall in love, with the work, with people you work with, with your dreams and their dreams. Whatever it was that got you to this school, don’t let it go. Whatever kept you here, don’t let that go. Believe in your friends. Believe that what you and your friends have to say… that the way you’re saying it – is something new in the world.

And don’t stop. Just hold on… and keep loving what you love… and you’ll see. In the end, they’ll let you stay.

Thank you.

Thank you, Chairman Fall, for that kind introduction.

President Jacobs, members of the class of 2011, university officials, distinguished faculty and staff, family and friends: good morning.

It is a pleasure to join you here in Savage Arena and I am honored to be asked to make a small contribution to this special occasion.

I understand that just last month, in this house, the Toledo Rockets won the WNIT1 women’s basketball championship.I understand that just last month, in this house, the Toledo Rockets won the WNIT women’s basketball championship. I understand that just last month, in this house, the Toledo Rockets won the WNIT women's basketball championship. They are the first team in the school’s history to win a national post-season tournament.

I am not even going to pretend that I can deliver a performance as historic as that today. I confess that when I was in college, my sport of choice was learning how to drink beer, a feat in which I, ultimately, was utterly unsuccessful.

There are several reasons for the pleasure and the emotion I feel at being here today. The first is because I find myself in front of so many young people in one of the most important moments of your lives.

And on behalf of both Chrysler Group and Fiat, I wish to express sincere congratulations to all of you receiving diplomas today from the University of Toledo.

You have achieved an important milestone, and you are about to embark on the next great adventure in your life.

I have no idea of the roads that you have traveled or of the dreams that you are building for your future. And even if I did know every minor detail, I would be very careful about handing out advice.

Even though I have become an interesting subject for people much younger than you.

A couple of days ago, I received this email. Spelling was not great, but the content was.

I am an 8th grader who is currently creating a portfolio that will help me learn more about the profession of being a CEO.

I wondered if you would be able to answer the three following questions that so that i can have a more in depth and personal understanding on this line of work?

1.After you ended college how did you get started?

The last two questions are priceless.

2.Should I get help and have a CFO and a COO or should i do it all myself?

3. What degree in college is needed for me to be taken seriously in the business world?

Please email me back with your response prior to May 15, 2011 so that I may include your insights in my final portfolio. I look forward to your response.

Regards,

This young man, as is and will be for each one of us, is the embodiment of a unique combination of factors, influences and interactions with others that will ultimately shape the choices we make. I have no road map to give you for your personal journey and I have no intention of teaching you a lesson.

What I can do is share some thoughts based on my own professional experience and the lessons I have learned personally.

There is another reason that I am particularly pleased to be here. Today is Mother’s day.

Mothers have a profound influence on shaping our lives, and I want to wish a Happy Mother’s Day to all of the Moms here today.

Mothers, and Fathers, you are justified in the pride you feel today, as your tremendous efforts have produced this group of bright and talented young men and women. Looking back to the past, thinking about the man I have become, it’s my family, my mother and father, who come to mind.

It is our families that help us begin to form the values that are to define us.

Then we grow and begin to mature, we go through different experiences: some less important and some more important, but they all contribute to formation of your character.

In the months and years ahead, you will face the enormous challenge of keeping up with a constantly changing world. You will need to be open and flexible in order to embrace that change. The winds of change will blow you off course if you are not anchored by a core set of values. While circumstances may change around us, values are not negotiable. Defining your values is much more than an academic exercise. It takes time and effort to clarify what you believe in, what puts meaning into your life and, ultimately, gives you integrity. Some groups of Native Americans envisioned conscience as a triangular stone located deep within us. Whenever values are violated, the stone revolves or turns.

With each turn, the corners of the stone cut you giving a tangible sign that something is wrong in your life. But with each turn, the corners wear off a little, too.

So if you continue to violate your values, eventually the sharp corners of the stone are rounded off meaning the conscience can no longer “cut” as it is meant to do.

In the face of constant change, a sense of values enables us to be resilient, to stay true to the important principles in life that have no borders: justice, integrity, honesty, and respect for others. It is important that when we exercise the privilege of making choices, we do so with rigor and commitment, and with full awareness of the consequences that they can have.

Commitment and rigor, together with a strong set of values, have been at the center of Chrysler’s turnaround.

The recent experience that our Company has been through could, in some way, be helpful to you in your own personal lives.

As you know, two years ago Chrysler had been handed a death sentence by the vast majority of financial analysts, the press and even the general public.

But instead of accepting this death sentence, with the help of President Obama’s administration, we rolled up our sleeves and worked intensely to transform our organization and culture. We succeeded in launching 16 new products in only 19 months, renewing 75% of the product portfolio. Market share is increasing and last Monday Chrysler announced its first quarterly net income since the Company began operations in June 2009.

And hopefully, in short order, less than two years after we received government support, we will repay every dollar that was lent to us by the American and Canadian governments, with interest. I’m not saying these things to brag about our accomplishments.

We still have much to accomplish with earnest commitment and humility.

I am telling you these things to give you an idea of the results that can be achieved when there are clear objectives, a strong motivation and enormous passion.

Our first quarter 2011 results represent more than just a positive income statement.

They represent the spirit of tens of thousands of people who, having suffered through the crisis, found the strength to pick themselves up and move forward.

They are a testimony to the pride of Chrysler, a company that went to hell and back and is determined to regain its rightful place in the global automotive landscape. They are a manifestation, above all, of the mentality of the team of individuals leading the business today.

Courageous individuals with a hunger for challenges and the will to shape their own future. Individuals who are not victims of change, but instead seek it out and often initiate it. Men and women who understand the concepts of service, community and respect for others. Men and women with the extraordinary capacity to bring out the best in others, help them build self-confidence and grow as professionals and, even more importantly, as human beings. They are the real architects of Chrysler's turnaround and they are also the best guarantee of its future.

As I look out at this arena, as I look at you graduates, your families and friends, I think of the historical moment we are living through as you receive your degrees.

We need to realize that we are at a crossroad, and this makes our choices even more important. This is a crucial moment and the world couldn’t need your talent and energies, your passion and commitment more.

The education you have received doesn’t just serve you or your family. It also serves the community as a whole.

You are fortunate to have been exposed to the knowledge and ideas of the faculty at this outstanding university, which has demonstrated an open mentality and created a dynamic and creative environment. The approach taken here at the University of Toledo is based on the very specific notion that, in the end, the real focus is man and the society in which he lives.

This was Einstein’s exhortation more than 70 years ago:

“One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The value of a man is in what he gives and not in what he is capable of receiving. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.” Einstein was right.

Focusing on oneself is a very limited ambition.

People who content themselves with their comfort zone are condemned to live in a self-made prison, where the walls are too high and too thick for air and light to get in. People who see only themselves are destined to remain trapped alone within the fragile two-dimensional image of a looking glass.

What a person has done during his life should not be measured by what he has achieved for himself, but rather by what he has left behind for others.

The prospects we have before us are open as never before. The power of the free market in a global economy is not up for discussion. None of us can stop or alter how the markets work. Neither do I believe it would be desirable. This open field of play serves as a guarantee that everyone can compete on an equal footing. It is the only way to have access to those things which we have never had before. But efficiency is not – and cannot be – the only thing that regulates life. There are bigger problems for which the market is not capable of offering a solution. And I don’t believe it ever will be able to.

There are parts of the world that are in a state of complete imbalance, where poverty and the lack of economic power of some social classes mean an overhaul of the system is desperately needed. There are countries where people are fighting for their destiny. Theirs is a struggle for freedom, for a dignified life and, in some cases, simply for survival.

These problems call a deeper issue into question: that is, the moral responsibility of our actions. At the 1999 World Economic Forum in Davos dealing with the impact of globalization, Nelson Mandela, the then President of the Republic of South Africa, addressed a collection of the most prominent politicians and business leaders from around the world.

I was fortunate enough to be in the audience when he spoke.

In his remarks, he raised some of the thorniest issues facing us all as we try to cope with the unprecedented speed of change impacting our lives.

His words are worth repeating as I believe they address humanity’s real challenge:

“Is globalization only to benefit the powerful and the financiers, speculators, investors and traders? Does it offer nothing to men, women and children who are ravaged by the violence of poverty? …You will therefore understand why this old man, to whom you have granted the privilege of bidding you farewell in the twilight of his public life and at the turn of the century, has raised such very practical matters of unfinished business.”

His words on that day served as a reminder that shaping the world the way we want it to be is not something that can be delegated to others.

These are the issues on which our society – any society that truly wants to define itself as fair – has a duty to question itself.

And Mandela wasn’t just talking to the powerful of the world. He was addressing each and every one of us. He was addressing the human tendency to cocoon ourselves in our relative well being, selfishness and indifference.

There are times when I wonder whether our failure to address the unfinished business that Mandela spoke of – the pervasive reluctance to take responsibility for shaping the future – is because we are just too comfortable in our relative well being and too indifferent to those in need. I wonder when the moment will arrive to take the first step and begin remedying the scandalous inequalities that exist in the world today.

I wonder whether – as we have done over the last decade including the action taken this week against a sworn enemy not only of the United States, but of liberty and of universal values – we would show the same commitment and be as effective in fighting an even more powerful and widespread enemy such as global poverty.

I wonder whether we will be capable of resolving the root causes of economic and social inequality before the gap becomes so vast that they cannot be ignored because they threaten the stability of the economic order we have carefully built and now cherish. I don't have all the answers.

But I believe that the future is not just the responsibility of governments. It's an individual and collective responsibility.

It's a challenge that calls for a concerted and shared commitment. Closing our eyes, or thinking that finding a solution is someone else's role, makes us part of the problem.

We all have a responsibility to make the most of the opportunities available to us now. We have a duty to commit to what we are able to do, to dedicate our individual skills and talents, to unite the best of society and work together to achieve higher objectives. I am talking to you about this because you are young and have the future in your hands. You are tomorrow’s leaders, and as such, you have a duty to open your minds and look beyond the walls of your offices. 

The essence of leadership, when all is said and done, is the personal assumption of the moral duty to be proactive in building our future.

Acknowledging one's own responsibility to give future generations hope for a better future. It is this is that makes leadership a privilege and a sacred trust. * * *

I would like to share one last thought with you that relates directly to the way in which you choose to live your lives.

Much of our lives are made up of clearly defined periods. Education is one of those periods.

A college degree is an important milestone along the path. When we pass it, we

may feel we're leaving behind a series of rules and rigid patterns, and that we are finally free. Free to choose for ourselves and to begin building what we want.

But feeling free and actually being free are two very different things.

The freedom I'm talking about is something inside you.

It is determined by how open-minded you remain, how receptive you are to the new or different, to the infinite possibilities that present themselves, even if you don’t go looking for them or could never have imagined them.

One piece of advice I can give you today is to not let the choices you make at a certain moment in your life – choices regarding your studies, the sector you work in, or the career path you take – shut everything else out.

There's so much more on the other side of the doors that present themselves to you. I did 9 years of University studies in Canada, and began with philosophy simply because, at that point of time in my life, it was something important for me.

Then I went on to study something completely

and started work as an accountant, then as a lawyer.

I widened my paths several times, first working in finance, then moving to operating roles in packaging, aluminum, chemicals, biotechnology, services, trucks, tractors and cars.

I can’t say if philosophy made me a better lawyer back then or if it makes me a better Chief Executive today.

But it did open my eyes and my mind to other things.

There will be many doors along your path, and behind each of those doors will be things that can change you and your lives.

But you will recognize them only if you have embraced a philosophy of appreciating everything that happens to you.

We all tend to filter the world around us through what we know. So try and go beyond what you already know, fill your mind with the new, nourish it with different interests, open it to the extraordinary.

Life is too short to let the world we experience be restricted by our own limited vision.

Those who are unable to see things from a different perspective, to listen to different opinions, and to go beyond their own limited experience, lose the opportunity to live life to the full.

And the biggest tragedy is that they will never realize what they have lost.

Of the many books I read as a teenager, one in particular was a source of great inspiration. The book was “Zorba the Greek” by Nikos Kazantzakis. I would like to share with you a passage from his writings: "We are little grubs, minute grubs on the small leaf of a tremendous tree. Some men - the more intrepid ones - reach the edge of the leaf. From there we stretch out, gazing into chaos.

We tremble. We guess what a frightening abyss lies beneath us. In the distance we can hear the noise of the other leaves of the tremendous tree, we feel the sap rising from the root of our leaf and our hearts swell. Bent thus over the awe-inspiring abyss, with all our bodies and all our souls, we tremble with terror.

From that moment begins. . . the great danger.

Some grow dizzy and delirious, others are afraid; they try to find an answer to strengthen their hearts, and they say: 'God!'

Others again, from the edge of the leaf, look over the precipice calmly and bravely and say: 'I like it !'." In that “I like it!” lies the lesson that at the beginning of this speech I promised not to give you. And in it lies the answer to what you will be tomorrow.

It depends on how you view the future. It depends on the faith you have in yourselves, your desire for knowledge and your willingness to test yourselves. There won't be anyone pushing you to the edge of the leaf, forcing you to abandon routine or the sense of security associated with habit and custom.

It will depend on you and you alone.

And it is also the only way you will find your wings and take flight. I can only hope that you will have the courage, every day, to listen to your heart and appreciate all that the world is capable of offering,

I hope that each one of you finds true freedom, and is able to get up every day, look around and say “I like it!”

I wish you all Godspeed

Thank you, President Spar.  Members of the board of trustees, esteemed members of the faculty, proud parents, squirming siblings, devoted friends:  congratulations to all of you.  But especially, congratulations to the magnificent Barnard Class of 2011.

Looking at you all here fills me with great joy, in part because my college roommate, a member of your faculty, Caroline Weber, is here.  Carrie, it means so much to me to be at your school, and in part because I work in Silicon Valley, let’s just say I’m not usually in a room with this many women.  For the wonderful men who are here today, if you feel a little uncomfortable, we’re really glad you’re here, and no line for the men’s room.  It’s worth it.

I graduated from college exactly 20 years ago.  And as I am reminded every single day where I work, that makes me really old.  Mark Zuckerberg, our founder and my boss, said to me the other day, “Sheryl, when do midlife crises happen?  When you’re 30?”  Not a good day at the office.  But I am old enough to know that most of our lives are filled with days we do not remember.  Today is not one of them.  You may not remember one word I say.  You may not even remember who your graduation speaker is, although for the record, Sheryl with an S.  You won’t remember that it was raining and we had to move inside.  But you will remember what matters, which is how you feel as you sit here, as you walk across the stage, as you start the next phase of your life.

Today is a day of celebration, a day to celebrate all the hard work that got you to this place where you can sit, kind of sweltering in that gown.  Today is a day of thanks, a day to thank all the people that helped you get here, the people who nurtured you and taught you, who held your hand, who dried your tears.  Today is a day of reflection.  Excuse me, a little laryngitis.

As you leave Barnard today, you leave not just with an education, but you take your place amongst the fortunate.  Some of you came here from families where education was expected and emphasized. Others of you had to overcome far more obstacles to get here, and today you become the very first member of your family to graduate from college.  What an amazing accomplishment.  But no matter where you started, as of today you are all privileged.  You are privileged in the most important sense of the word, which is that you have almost boundless opportunity in front of you.  So, the question is, what are you going to do with it?  What will you do with this education you worked so hard to achieve?  What in the world needs to change, and what part do you plan on playing in changing it?

Pulitzer Prize winners Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas Kristof visited this campus last year and they spoke about their critically important book, Half the Sky.  In that book, they assert that the fundamental moral challenge of the 19th century was slavery; of the 20th century, it was totalitarianism; and for our century, it is oppression of girls and women around the world.  Their book is a call to arms, to give women all over the world, women who are exactly like us except for the circumstances into which they were born, basic human rights.

Compared to these women, we are lucky.  In America, as in the entire developed world, we are equals under the law.  But the promise of equality is not equality.  As we sit here looking at this magnificent blue-robed class, we have to admit something that’s sad but true:  men run the world.  Of 190 heads of 2 state, nine are women.  Of all the parliaments around the world, 13% of those seats are held by women. Corporate America top jobs, 15% are women; numbers which have not moved at all in the past nine years.  Nine years.  Of full professors around the United States, only 24% are women.

I recognize that this is a vast improvement from generations in the past.  When my mother took her turn to sit in a gown at her graduation, she thought she only had two career options:  nursing and teaching. She raised me and my sister to believe that we could do anything, and we believed her.  But what is so sad—it doesn’t just make me feel old, it makes me truly sad—is that it’s very clear that my generation is not going to change this problem.  Women became 50% of the college graduates in this country in 1981, 30 years ago.  Thirty years is plenty of time for those graduates to have gotten to the top of their industries, but we are nowhere close to 50% of the jobs at the top.  That means that when the big
decisions are made, the decisions that affect all of our worlds, we do not have an equal voice at that table.  

So today, we turn to you.  You are the promise for a more equal world.  You are our hope.  I truly believe that only when we get real equality in our governments, in our businesses, in our companies and our universities, will we start to solve this generation’s central moral problem, which is gender equality.  We need women at all levels, including the top, to change the dynamic, reshape the conversation, to make sure women’s voices are heard and heeded, not overlooked and ignored. 

So my hope for all of you here, for every single one of you, is that you’re going to walk across the stage and get your diploma.  You’re going to go out tonight or maybe all summer and celebrate.  You deserve it.  And then you’re going to lean way into your career.  You’re going to find something you love doing, and you’re going to do it with gusto.  You’re going to pick your field and you’re going to ride it all the way to the top.

So, what advice can I give you to help you achieve this goal?  The first thing is I encourage you to think big.  Studies show very clearly that in our country, in the college-educated part of the population, men are more ambitious than women.  They’re more ambitious the day they graduate from college; they remain more ambitious every step along their career path.  We will never close the achievement gap until we close the ambition gap.  But if all young women start to lean in, we can close the ambition gap right here, right now, if every single one of you leans in.  Leadership belongs to those who take it.  Leadership starts with you.

The next step is you’re going to have to believe in yourself potentially more than you do today.  Studies also show that compared to men, women underestimate their performance.  If you ask men and women questions about completely objective criteria such as GPAs or sales goals, men get it wrong slightly high; women get it wrong slightly low.  More importantly, if you ask men why they succeeded, men attribute that success to themselves; and women, they attribute it to other factors like working harder, help from others.  Ask a woman why she did well on something, and she’ll say, “I got lucky.  All of these great people helped me.  I worked really hard.”  Ask a man and he’ll say or think, “What a dumb question.  I’m awesome.”  So women need to take a page from men and own their own success.

That’s much easier to say than to do.  I know this from my own experience.  All along the way, I’ve had all of those moments, not just some of the time; I would say most of the time, where I haven’t felt that I owned my success.  I got into college and thought about how much my parents helped me on my essays. I went to the Treasury Department because I was lucky to take the right professor’s class who took me to Treasury.  Google, I boarded a rocket ship that took me up with everyone else. 

Even to this day, I have those moments.  I have those moments all the time, probably far more than you can imagine I would.  I know I need to make the adjustments.  I know I need to believe in myself and raise my hand, because I’m sitting next to some guy and he thinks he’s awesome.  So, to all of you, if you remember nothing else today, remember this:  You are awesome.  I’m not suggesting you be boastful. No one likes that in men or women.  But I am suggesting that believing in yourself is the first necessary step to coming even close to achieving your potential.

You should also know that there are external forces out there that are holding you back from really owning your success.  Studies have shown—and yes, I kind of like studies—that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women.  This means that as men get more successful and powerful, both men and women like them better.  As women get more powerful and successful, everyone, including women, likes them less.  

I’ve experienced this firsthand.  When I first joined Facebook, there was a well-read blog out in the Valley that devoted some incredibly serious pixels to trashing me.  Anonymous sources called me a liar, two-faced, about to ruin Facebook forever.  I cried some when I was alone, I lost a bunch of sleep.  Then I told myself it didn’t matter.  Then everyone else told me it didn’t matter, which just reminded me of one thing:  they were reading it too.  I fantasized about all kinds of rejoinders, but in the end, my best and only response was just to do my job and do it well.  When Facebook’s performance improved, the trash talk went away.  

Do I believe I was judged more harshly because of my double-Xs?  Yes.  Do I think this will happen to me again in my career?  Sure.  I told myself that next time I’m not going to let it bother me, I won’t cry.  I’m not sure that’s true.  But I know I’ll get through it.  I know that the truth comes out in the end, and I know how to keep my head down and just keep working.

If you think big, if you own your own success, if you lead, it won’t just have external costs, but it may cause you some personal sacrifice.  Men make far fewer compromises than women to balance professional success and personal fulfillment.  That’s because the majority of housework and childcare still falls to women.  If a heterosexual couple work full time, the man will do—the woman, sorry—the woman will do two times the amount of housework and three times the amount of childcare that her husband will do.  From my mother’s generation to mine, we have made far more progress making the workforce even than we have making the home even, and the latter is hurting the former very dramatically.  So it’s a bit counterintuitive, but the most important career decision you’re going to make is whether or not you have a life partner and who that partner is.  If you pick someone who’s willing to share the burdens and the joys of your personal life, you’re going to go further.  A world where men ran half our homes and women ran half our institutions would be just a much better world.

I have a six-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter.  I want more choices for both of them.  I want my son to have the choice to be a full partner not just at work, but at home; and I want my daughter to have a choice to do either.  But if she chooses work, to be well-liked for what she accomplishes.  We can’t wait for the term “work/life balance” to be something that’s not just discussed at women’s conferences.

Of course not everyone wants to jump into the workforce and rise to the top.  Life is going to bring many twists and turns, and each of us, each of you, have to forge your own path.  I have deep respect for my friends who make different choices than I do, who choose the really hard job of raising children full time, who choose to go part time, or who choose to pursue more nontraditional goals.  These are choices that you may make some day, and these are fine choices.  

But until that day, do everything you can to make sure that when that day comes, you even have a choice to make.  Because what I have seen most clearly in my 20 years in the workforce is this:  Women almost never make one decision to leave the workforce.  It doesn’t happen that way.  They make small little decisions along the way that eventually lead them there.  Maybe it’s the last year of med school when they say, I’ll take a slightly less interesting specialty because I’m going to want more balance one day.  Maybe it’s the fifth year in a law firm when they say, I’m not even sure I should go for partner, because I know I’m going to want kids eventually.  

These women don’t even have relationships, and already they’re finding balance, balance for responsibilities they don’t yet have.  And from that moment, they start quietly leaning back.  The problem is, often they don’t even realize it.  Everyone I know who has voluntarily left a child at home
and come back to the workforce—and let’s face it, it’s not an option for most people.  But for people in this audience, many of you are going to have this choice.  Everyone who makes that choice will tell you the exact same thing:  You’re only going to do it if your job is compelling.

If several years ago you stopped challenging yourself, you’re going to be bored.  If you work for some guy who you used to sit next to, and really, he should be working for you, you’re going to feel undervalued, and you won’t come back.  So, my heartfelt message to all of you is, and start thinking
about this now, do not leave before you leave.  Do not lean back; lean in.  Put your foot on that gas pedal and keep it there until the day you have to make a decision, and then make a decision.  That’s the only way, when that day comes, you’ll even have a decision to make.

What about the rat race in the first place?  Is it worthwhile?  Or are you just buying into someone else’s definition of success?  Only you can decide that, and you’ll have to decide it over and over and over.  But if you think it’s a rat race, before you drop out, take a deep breath.  Maybe you picked the wrong job. Try again.  And then try again.  Try until you find something that stirs your passion, a job that matters to you and matters to others.  It is the ultimate luxury to combine passion and contribution.  It’s also a very clear path to happiness.

At Facebook we have a very broad mission.  We don’t just want you to post all your pictures of tonight up there and use Facebook to keep in touch, even though we want that, so do a lot of that.  We want to connect the whole world.  We want to make the whole world more open and more transparent.  The one thing I’ve learned working with great entrepreneurs—Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google—that if you want to make a difference, you better think big and dream big, right from day one.

We try at Facebook to keep all of our employees thinking big all day.  We have these posters in red we put around the walls.  One says, “Fortune favors the bold.”  Another says, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”  That question echoes Barnard alum Anna Quindlen, who said that she majored in unafraid.  Don’t let your fears overwhelm your desire.  Let the barriers you face—and there will be barriers—be external, not internal.  Fortune does favor the bold, and I promise that you will never know what you’re capable of unless you try.

You’re going to walk off this stage today and you’re going to start your adult life.  Start out by aiming high.  Like everyone here, I have great hopes for the members of this graduating class.  I hope you find true meaning, contentment and passion in your life.  I hope that you navigate the hard times and you come out with greater strength and resolve.  I hope that whatever balance you seek, you find it with your eyes wide open.  And I hope that you—yes, you—each and every one of you have the ambition to run the world, because this world needs you to run it.  Women all around the world are counting on you.  I’m counting on you.

I know that’s a big challenge and responsibility, a really daunting task, but you can do it.  You can do it if you lean in.  So go home tonight and ask yourselves, “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?”  And then go do it.  Congratulations, 2011.

Well, thanks, President Nikias, Dean Ellis, ladies and gentlemen, award winners, honored award recipients, and most importantly graduates of the Class of 2011.

I was particularly fired up to get the opportunity to speak today at President Nikias’ first commencement. I’m not quite sure what the USC traditions are to schedule a man’s first commencement on Friday the 13th. And I’m kind of a little nervous. I’m a little superstitious. I was working on a big project early this week. I was afraid I might not be able to be here. I thought I might have to Skype in. I’m glad to be here today. By the way, to all the families and graduates, post-graduation please Skype on.

I want to start with congratulations to all of the graduates of the Class of 2011. It’s really quite amazing, it’s a journey, people will describe it, but at the end of the day I want you to just take one minute and celebrate it, because you deserve it, baby, to the Class of 2011. And to all the parents and family who are here, I know you deserve it.

Until about two years ago, I didn’t know much about USC. I had never even been on the campus. So, you can call me, if you will, a newbie. I first visited two years ago. I have a son who just finished his freshman year here at USC. I have to tell you, it’s an infectious place. It is really an infectious place. I feel like I really drank the USC Kool-Aid. I show up here for my first Parents Weekend, run into this sort of primitive ritual called the Tailgate. I proceed to a game against the University of Washington in my backyard where I’ve lived for 31 years, and I’m sitting there with Dean Ellis going, “come on Trojans.” We won’t discuss the outcome.

I also have to tell you, a guy I know in Seattle has a son who goes to the school down the street here, UCLA. And I saw him the other day, yes, that’s right. I saw him the other day, and he starts chirping at me, chirp, chirp, chirp. I said, “I’m going down to USC to speak.” Chirp, chirp, chirp, UCLA better, chirp, chirp, chirp. I had it. I whip out my Windows Phone, I Bing the university rankings, and I just show it to him right there in black and white, USC 23 – UCLA 25. So, I’ve had the Kool-Aid.

I come here today imbued with a lot of optimism. I’m naturally, it’s kind of my personality, a very optimistic personality. And yet, I’m also optimistic because of the opportunity I’ve had to work in the field of information technology. Information technology has shaped the world. Information technology has been able to advance the world in a way that’s like none other, frankly, in human history. We’re sitting here 60 years, essentially, after the introduction of the first computer. And yet the amount of invention and creation that is continuing to go on to make society smaller, to lead to advances in science, and medicine and education, in communications, in media, is really quite remarkable.

I would ask the parents who are here to think back to about the time you would have been college age. Try writing a term paper without a word processor and without the Internet. That was the world we grew up in. And, of course, it’s inconceivable today.

When I decided to go to Microsoft, I was actually in the middle of an academic program. I was going for an MBA. And a friend of mine, Bill Gates, who I had gone to college with, he says, “Hey, Steve, why don’t you drop out and come join me?” Drop out? My father didn’t go to college. Dropping out, bad idea.

So, I went home and I told my mom and dad, I think I’m going to drop out, join a tiny little company, friend of mine. But, boom, my parents jump in. They said, what do they do? Software. Software for personal computers. My father comes up out of his chair. “What’s software?” Pretty inconceivable today. My mother asked an even more interesting question for the year 1980, why would a person ever need a computer? The opportunities that are proceeding are really quite amazing. And I don’t think there would be any better time to really come out of school, and have a chance to make a difference across a broad variety of fields.

Our industry, boom, we’re driving forward. We’re going to be creating new things. And certainly I had a chance to talk to about 30 Trojans last night who will all be joining Microsoft after graduation. The kind of optimism with which we can talk about the opportunities is incredible. And that same technology base is going to help, as I said, in so many other fields.

I would like you to think about here things, three things that I’ve had a chance to decide are really important based upon the time I’ve spent at Microsoft, and I’ve spent in the information technology industry. Number one, great ideas matter. Number two, find passion. And, number three, be tenacious, be irrepressible. Those three things are just, boom, bake them in, that’s what I encourage at least my poor freshman son to do, bake them in. They’ll really take you a long way. Microsoft was really founded on a single good idea, an insight, a direction that Bill Gates and Paul Allen had that nobody had had. The microprocessor is a form of free intelligence, and with the right software there will be a computer on every desk, and in every home. And now we can say every pocket and every television set, and every everything.

And even today that same fundamental idea and where it can take us remains infinitely powerful. Another way to sort of grab this idea about ideas and direction, I like a quote from Wayne Gretzky. He says, good hockey players skate to where the puck is; great hockey players will skate to where the puck is going to be. Ideas and direction really matter, and you had an opportunity here at USC to be educated, to be exposed, to pick up so much that will give you the insights and the ideas that will matter to you and to the world as we move forward.

Second, find passion. This is not an easy one. People think passion is something you either have or you don’t. People think passion is something that has to manifest itself in some kind of explosive and emotional format. It’s not. It’s the thing that you find in your life that you can care about, that you can cling to, that you can invest yourself in, heart, body, and soul. Finding passion is kind of your job now.

It’s been your job the last four years at USC, or shorter, or longer, depending on which program you’re in. And it’s your job as you go forward into the world. You won’t necessarily find it the minute you get out.

I think about my own personal sort of discovery of passion. I didn’t come to the technology industry naturally. I wrote my first computer program in ninth grade, and I hated it. I was shy as a kid. I don’t think that I qualify on that anymore. I got to college and I was going to be a physicist or a mathematician. I decided I had way too little patience after about the end of my freshman year, and I groped for other things to do.

The thing that switched me on, actually, I was the football manager for our college football team. And I discovered through that that I like to organize things, that that was kind of my passion. I got out of college, as many of you are, and I went to work for a great company, and I found I didn’t have the patience to work marketing brownie mixes and cake mixes. I had to give it up after a year or two.

Then by luck, as I was thinking about a career in the movie business, another business that I thought might match my patience and attention span, my buddy called and I was introduced to this fast paced, wonderful industry, where I could be a little organizer of a 30-person company from day one. And I found my passion. It takes a lot of trial and error. It takes a lot of experimentation. Find your passion, so that every day you can get up, even on the bad days you can get up and say, I really do love what I’m doing. This really does fire me up.

And last but not least, be tenacious. I actually prefer the word irrepressible, but everybody I ran the speech by says it’s too hard for people to get. But, irrepressible is kind of tenacious, but with optimism. You just have it in you. You keep going and going. You could say, isn’t that the same as passion. It’s not. Passion is the ability to get excited about something. Irrepressibility and tenacity is about the ability to stay with it. If you take a look at all of the companies that have been started in our business, most of them fail. If you take even a look at the companies that have succeeded, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, you name it, all of these companies went through times of hardship. You get some success. You run into some walls. You try a formula for a new idea, a new innovation, it doesn’t work. And it’s how tenacious you are, how irrepressible, how ultimately optimistic and tenacious you are about it that will determine your success.

I happen to think that’s a good lesson. It’s not just a lesson in our business. It’s not just a lesson that we learned with our Xbox product, or our this, or our that. It’s a lesson that applies whether you’re going into science, or medicine, or business, or any other walk of life. Ideas matter, find your passion, and be tenacious.

One question I think you’ve got to ask sitting here today is, how did USC do in preparing you for that, by my kind of short period of time to analyze I’d say awfully darned well. You’ve had a chance to explore academically. You’ve had a chance to explore through extracurricular activities, through athletics, through social things. You’ve had a chance to develop ideas and opinions that might matter, that you can take forward into the world.

But, I actually think it’s on this notion of passion, tenacity that perhaps USC is most special. To me USC seems to have a culture that promotes passion, that promotes tenacity, that promotes irrepressibility. I’ve had a chance over the last couple of years to meet a number of teachers, men and women, who have a chance to work with students here at USC, including a new neighbor of mine lives a few houses down the street, Pete Carroll. I have never met a more passionate, irrepressible human being. He happens to work for one of the founders of Microsoft, Paul Allen, who said to me, I’m not sure what we’re going to get when we put you and Pete in a room, Steve, but it’s going to literally sing with energy.

So, I do think USC has a special culture. And, in fact, I think you start learning about passion and tenacity at USC before you ever come here. I think it’s the first thing the school teaches. I think you knew it before you ever finished your first tour of the USC campus. The model of this place just sort of, to me, symbolizes passion and tenacity. Fight on, passion and tenacity. Fight on. Passion and tenacity. Fight on.

This is a Steve Ballmer. That’s a fight on. This is a class with passion and tenacity. Go get them Class of 2011. I know you’ll succeed. 

I am honored to be with you as we gather to celebrate your graduation from Philadelphia University.

While I teach at Stanford and Berkeley, to be honest… this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation.

I realize that my 15 minutes up here is all that’s between you and the rest or your life, so if I can keep you awake, I’m going to share 4 short stories from my life.

My first story is about finding your passion.
My parents were immigrants…  Neither of them had been to college—my mother graduated from high school but my father left school after the 7th grade.  Still, like many immigrants, they dreamed that someday their children would go to college…  Unfortunately that was their dream—but it wasn’t mine.

I ended up at Michigan State because I got a scholarship…Once I got there, I was lost…unfocused…and had no idea of who I was and why I was in school. I hated school.

One day my girlfriend said, “You know some of us are working hard to stay here. But you don’t seem to care.Why don’t you find out what you really want to do?”

That was the moment I realized I, …not anyone else…was in charge of my life.

I took her advice. I dropped out of Michigan State University after the first semester.

In the middle of a Michigan winter, I stuck out my thumb and hitchhiked to Miami, the warmest place I could think of.

I had no idea what would be at the end of the highway. But that day I began a pattern that I still follow—stick out your thumb and see where the road takes you.

I managed to find a job at the Miami International Airport loading racehorses onto cargo planes. I didn’t like the horses, but the airplanes caught my interest.

Airplanes were the most complicated things I had ever seen. Unlike other kids who were fans of the pilots, I was in awe of the electronics technicians in charge of the planes’ instruments. I would hang around the repair shop just helping out wherever I could. I didn’t know anything, so I didn’t get paid…

But soon some technician took me under his wing and gave me my first tutorial on electronics, radar and navigation. I was hooked. I started taking home all the equipment manuals and would read them late into the night.

For the first time in my life, I found something I was passionate about.

And the irony is that if I hadn’t dropped out, I would never have found this passion…the one that began my career. If I hadn’t discovered something I truly loved to do, I might be driving a cab at the Miami airport.

My life continued to follow this same pattern…I’d pursue my curiosity, volunteer to help, and show up a lot. Again and again, the same thing would happen… people would notice that I cared…and I’d get a chance to learn something new.

Now that you paid for your degree…I’m going to let you in on a secret. It’s your curiosity and enthusiasm that will get you noticed and make your life interesting—not your grade point average.

But at the time…as excited as I was…I couldn’t see how my passion for airplanes and avionics could ever get me anywhere.  Without money, or a formal education, how could I learn about them?

The answer turned out to be a war.

My second story is about Volunteering and Showing Up.
In the early 1970’s, as some of you might remember, our country was in the middle of the Vietnam War—-and the Air Force was happy to have me.

I enlisted to learn how to repair electronics. The Air Force sent me to a year of military electronics school. While college had been someone else’s dream, learning electronics had become mine.

After electronics school, when most everyone else was being sent overseas to a war-zone, I was assigned to one of the cushiest bases in the Air Force, right outside of Miami.

My first week on the base… our shop chief announced: “We’re looking for some volunteers to go to Thailand.” I still remember the laughter and comments from my fellow airmen. “You got to be kidding… leave Miami for a war in Southeast Asia?”

Others wisely remembered the first rule in the military: never volunteer for anything. Listening to them, I realized they were right. Not volunteering was the sane path of safety, certainty and comfort.

So I stepped forward, raised my hand—and I said, “I’ll go.”

Once again, I was going to see where the road would take me. Volunteering for the unknown…which meant leaving the security of what I knew…would continually change my life.

Two weeks later I was lugging heavy boxes across the runway under the broiling Thailand sun. My job was to replace failed electronic warfare equipment in fighter planes as they returned from bombing missions over North Vietnam.

As I faced yet another 110-degree day, I did consider that perhaps my decision to leave Miami might have been a bit hasty. Yet every day I would ask, “Where does our equipment come from… and how do we know it’s protecting our airplanes?”

The answer I got was, “Don’t you know there’s a war on? Shut up and keep doing what you’re told.”

Still I was forever curious. At times continually asking questions got me in trouble…

once it almost sent me to jail…

but mostly it made me smarter.

I wanted to know more.  I had found something I loved to do.. …and I wanted to get better at it.

When my shift on the flightline was over, my friends would go downtown drinking. Instead, I’d often head into the shop and volunteer to help repair broken jammers and receivers. Eventually, the shop chief who ran this 150-person shop approached me and asked, “You’re really interested in this stuff, aren’t you?” He listened to me babble for a while, and then walked me to a stack of broken electronic equipment and challenged me troubleshoot and fix them.

Hours later when I was finished, he looked at my work and told me, “We need another pair of hands repairing this equipment. As of tomorrow you no longer work on the flightline.” He had just given me a small part of the electronic warfare shop to run.

People talk about getting lucky breaks in their careers. I’m living proof that the “lucky breaks” theory is simply wrong. You get to make your own luck. 80% of success in your career will come from just showing up. The world is run by those who show up…not those who wait to be asked.

Eighteen months after arriving in Thailand, I was managing a group of 15 electronics technicians.

I had just turned 20 years old.

My third story is about Failure and Redemption
After I left the military, I ended up in Palo Alto, a town south of San Francisco. Years later this area would become known as Silicon Valley.

For a guy who loved technology, I was certainly in the right place. Endlessly curious, I went from startups in military intelligence to microprocessors to supercomputers to video games.

I was always learning. There were times I worried that my boss might find out how much I loved my job…and if he did, he might make me pay to work there. To be honest, I would have gladly done so.  While I earned a good salary, I got up and went to work every day not because of the pay, but because I loved what I did.

As time went on, I was a co-founder or member of the starting team for six high-tech startups…

With every startup came increasing responsibility. I reached what I then thought was the pinnacle of my career when I raised tens of millions of dollars and became CEO of my seventh startup… a hot new video game company. My picture was in all the business magazines, and made it onto the cover of Wired magazine. Life was perfect.

And then one day it wasn’t.

It all came tumbling down. We had believed our own press, inhaled our own fumes and built lousy games. Customers voted with their wallets and didn’t buy our products. The company went out of business. Given the press we had garnered, it was a pretty public failure.

We let our customers, our investors, and our employees down. While it was easy to blame it on others…and trust me at first I tried… in the end it was mostly a result of my own hubris—the evil twin of entrepreneurial passion and drive.

I thought my career and my life were over. But I learned that in Silicon Valley, honest failure is a badge of experience.

In fact, unlike in the movies, most startups actually fail. For every Facebook and Zynga that make the press, thousands just never make it at all.

All of you will fail at some time in your career…or in love, or in life.

No one ever sets out to fail. But being afraid to fail means you’ll be afraid to try.  Playing it safe will get you nowhere.

As it turned out, rather than run me out of town on a rail, the two venture capital firms that had lost $12 million in my failed startup actually asked me to work with them.

During the next couple years…and much humbler… I raised more money and started another company, one that was lucky enough to go public in the dot.com bubble.

In 1999… with the company’s revenue north of $100 million…I handed the keys to a new CEO and left. I had married a wonderful woman and together we had two young daughters.

I decided that after 20 years of working 24/7 in eight startups, I wanted to go home and watch my kids grow up.

Which brings me to my last story—There’s a Pattern Here.
When I retired I found myself with lots of time to think.

I began to reflect about my career and what had happened in my 21 years with startups in Silicon Valley.

I was all alone in a ski cabin with the snow falling outside…with my wife and daughters out on the slopes all day… I started to collect my thoughts by writing what I had hoped would become my memoirs.

Eighty pages later, I realized that I had some great stories as an entrepreneur and a failed CEO. But while writing them was a great catharsis, it was quickly becoming clear that I’d even have to pay my wife and kids to read the stories.

But the more I thought about what I had done, and what other entrepreneurs had tried, I realized something absurdly simple was staring at me.  I saw a repeatable pattern that no else had ever noticed.

Business schools and investors were treating new companies like they were just small versions of large companies. But it struck me that startups were actually something totally different. Startups were actually like explorers—searching for a new world, where everything—customers, markets, prices—were unknown and new.

These startups needed to be inventive as they explore, trying new and different things daily. In contrast, existing companies, the Wal-Mart’s and McDonalds, already had road maps, guide books and playbooks—they already know their customers, markets, and prices. To succeed they just need to do the same thing every day.

Now it would have been easy to say, “Nah, this can’t be right—every smart professor at Harvard and Wharton and Stanford believes something different.”

In fact, in your lives this will happen to you.

You will have a new idea, and people will tell you, “That can’t be right because we’ve always done it this way.”

Ignore them…..  Be persistent… Never give up. Innovation comes from those who see things that other don’t.

As a retired CEO, I had a lot of free time.  So I was often invited to be a guest lecturer at the business school at Berkeley. They thought I could tell stories about what it was like to start a company. I was generous with my time…and I showed up a lot.

But I began to nag the head of the department about this new idea I had…one that basically said that everything you learn about starting new companies in business schools was wrong. I thought that there was a better a way to teach and manage startups than the conventional wisdom of the last 40 years. And to their credit…Berkeley’s Business School and then Stanford’s Engineering School let me write and teach a new course based on my ideas.

Now…a decade later… that course called Customer Development… is the basis of an entirely new way to start companies.

If you’re in a technology company or build a web or mobile application, it’s probably the only way to start a company.

How did this happen?  By showing up a lot and questioning the status quo.

These days I write a weekly blog about entrepreneurship.  At the end of each post, I conclude with lessons learned—a kind of Cliff Notes of my key takeaways.  So in case you haven’t been listening, that’s how I’ll finish up today.Be forever curious.
Volunteer for everything.
Show up a lot.
Treat failure as a learning experience.

Live life with no regrets.
Remembering … There is no undo button.

Congratulations again to you all … and thank you very much.

I’m supposed to keep it short, and I approve of that. Being a drama critic, I know, or at least I’m supposed to know, that you should leave ’em wanting more. So I’ll be brief—and, I hope, to the point.

I don’t know any of you, but I already know something about you, and it’s this: you are remarkable. Remarkable by definition, because you have done something remarkable. You got a college degree at night, and if I know anything about American life today, I know that you didn’t have much time to spare. You came to Rollins after putting in a full day’s work. You did your homework at night or early in the morning or on weekends. That tells me everything about you, and it fills me with admiration. You have a right to be proud. You’ve earned it. So enjoy it—today.

And after that? Well, I’m thinking of a scene from a movie I like, Bull Durham. Tim Robbins, the hot young rookie pitcher, trots into the dugout after pitching a fantastic inning. He says, “I was great, huh?”

But Kevin Costner, the veteran catcher who’s trying to get him ready for the big leagues, isn’t having any of it. He says, “Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging. In the show they would’ve ripped you.”

Robbins says, “Can’t you let me enjoy the moment?”

And Costner says, “The moment’s over.”

Well, folks, the moment isn’t over yet, but it’ll be ending shortly after lunch. Yes, be proud for all the days of your life—but after lunch, remember that you’ve got to go back to work on Monday. And that’s what the rest of my speech is about: it’s about what to do on Monday morning.

Graduation addresses are usually given by persons of a certain age who are assumed, usually wrongly, to have acquired great wisdom to go with their gray hairs, and who are charged to pass that wisdom on to a captive audience of men and women in robes and funny hats. Believe me, I don’t claim to be wise, but I do have plenty of gray hair. I’ve also learned a few things about life and work in my fifty-five years on this planet, and I’m going to share two of them—just two—with you. They’re the two best pieces of advice I know. I’m going to tell you what the world wants from you, and I’m going to tell you what you should want from the world.

Here’s what the world wants from you: it wants you to be professional. Show up on time. Be a good colleague. Get the job done, and do it well enough that nobody has to clean up your mess.

Why is that good advice? Because the world is full to the brim of unprofessional people, many of whom are very smart and a few of whom are geniuses. You’ve known folks like that, folks who are always saying incredibly clever things off the top of their head, and I bet that sometimes they’ve made you feel small and inadequate.

But here’s the secret of life. If you’re professional and they’re not—if you show up on time every morning and get the job done and they show up two hours later and start spouting clever excuses for being late the second they walk through the door—then nine times out of ten, you will win and they will lose.

The world is hungry for professionalism. Be a professional and you’ll never have to look for work, at least not for very long.

Now, here’s what you should want from the world. When I was a boy, I noticed that my father didn’t really like what he did for a living. It didn’t suit him. He hadn’t set his heights high enough as a young man, and so he spent most of the rest of his life working at a job that didn’t engage enough of his brain to keep him satisfied. And I said to myself: I don’t know what I want to do when I grow up, but whatever it is, I don’t want to be bored.

And that’s my second piece of advice to you: whatever you end up doing in this life, make sure above all that it’s interesting. Because most likely you’re going to spend a third of the rest of your life, eight hours out of twenty-four, working for a living. And if what you do bores you, that means you’re going to spend a third of the rest of your life being bored. And believe me, friends, that is no way to live.

Now I’m a very lucky man. I get paid to see plays and write about them. I won’t lie to you: sometimes that’s boring. But not very often. Most of the time I sit down in my aisle seat on Broadway or in Chicago or San Diego or Orlando, and I smile and say, “I have the best job in the world.” I’m not foolish enough to think that luck had absolutely nothing to do with it. But I also know that luck has a way of happening to people who shoot high, who never sell themselves short. I didn’t, and now I’m a happy man—so long as the play is good.

One more story and I’m done. Since I’m a drama critic, I’ll make it a Broadway story. It’s about Leland Hayward, who used to be a big Broadway producer. He was going to put on a play by Maxwell Anderson called Anne of the Thousand Days, and he asked Anderson who should play Henry VIII. Anderson gave it some thought, then he played it safe and suggested a good, solid actor with no flair, no panache.

Hayward got red in the face, banged on the desk, and said, “No, no, Max! Suppose there were absolutely no problems in getting anyone in the world you wanted. Who would you pick?”

Anderson didn’t hesitate for a moment. He said, “Rex Harrison—but you’ll never get him.”

And Hayward grinned and said, “Why not ask him?” He picked up the phone and started placing calls, and an hour later, Rex Harrison had agreed to play Henry VIII.

Then Hayward hung up, grinned, and said, “There’s a lesson in this, Max. Never start out asking for someone you’d eventually settle for.”

You see the point. If there’s ever a time in life for you to shoot high, it’s now. So take a long, cool look at yourself and say, What do I really want out of life? What would keep me interested until the day I die? Do I have a realistic chance to get it? And if you think you do, then go for it. Work as hard to get it as you worked to get your degree here. Settle later, if you must—but don’t spend the rest of your life eating your heart out because you didn’t give it your very best shot right now.

And that’s that. I congratulate you, members of the Class of 2011, for doing something truly remarkable. Remember: be proud. Be professional. Don’t be bored. Enjoy the moment. And be sure to get a good lunch.

Thank you.

Hi everyone. First of all, I’m so honored to have been invited to speak with you today - a graduation speech is a rare opportunity to engage with you at such an amazing turning point in your lives. I want to congratulate the graduates on their great achievement today. And I want to thank the faculty and administration and all the parents here for all their hard work in putting today’s event together and in the labor of love in providing all of you with an excellent education.

I work at Samsung at the User Experience Innovations Lab, and to explain what that involves: We create concepts and designs for future products for Samsung, cell phones, TVs, cameras, and so forth. The “user experience” part of our work refers to the idea that product design should be centered around the experience that people have, making the products useful, convenient, friendly, fun, and usable.

There are a lot of ways to think about usability, but the essence is that when you design, you should deeply care about people, have a passion for people. That’s a passion worth devoting your life to, and one worthy of all the disciplines in this room: culinary arts, media design, film, interaction, fashion. Love the people who you are designing for and passionately drive to give them something that will make their lives better, make them happy, and empower them. For me, it’s a life philosophy worthy of any career: devote what you do to the people you impact.

Let me bring that philosophy into the concrete details of everyday life. I had a good opportunity to explain usability to my niece when we went out for breakfast one day. At the restaurant, we were given menu cards to fill out to order our breakfast. If you wanted waffles, you had to check one of 3 boxes for maple, raspberry, or blackberry syrup. My niece was flustered. She said “I want to order a waffle, but I don’t want to have any syrup. I just wanted a plain waffle.” There wasn’t an option for a plain waffle, and if you didn’t check one of the syrups, you wouldn’t get a waffle. So I told her “That’s what usability is all about. They haven’t tested this menu with people and made sure people could use it right.” And that’s what good art of any kind does: it makes sure it works, for people.

You have the opportunity in everything you do to make choices and designs that matter to people, from the smallest details.

An artist who really valued that focus on details was Edgar Degas, an impressionist painter, who said of the creative process, “One has to commit a painting the way one commits a crime.”

Making an impact requires that same obsessive attention to detail and perfect execution as a crime. You have to prepare for setbacks, with the same thrill and passion for the outcome, with the same secret pleasure after the successful execution.

Creating requires that you not merely be expressive, but that you be accountable to your success, that every decision and action work toward the final outcome you intend. And I want to encourage you to make that outcome first and foremost people-centric, that you design to be democratic, humane, consumer-oriented, and empowering. And that you deliver quality in what you create: be evocative, profound, and delightful.

I didn’t realize one of the biggest influences on my life and thinking until I was much older than most of you. My father was a nuclear physicist who worked for the environmental protection agency. I thought I had gone so far onto a different path in life that I didn’t make the connection. Every year, he attended the Health Physics conference, a field of people specializing in radiation health and safety. This integration of his scientific field with a human-centered focus turned out to be a template for me in how I think everyone should approach their work. Today, I want to share with you a few of my heroes, and in that vein, my first hero is my father, who blended technology and humanity by working in health physics.

My father was a big science fiction fan, and that leads to another hero of mine, Jules Verne [1828-1905], who pioneered science fiction with books like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Around the World in 80 Days. Verne was a creative spirit who blended science with human exploration and human potential. Like many of us, Verne didn’t immediately start out knowing how to fund his creative passion for writing. He worked as a stock broker writing novels in his spare hours for years until he finally had a big enough success to quit his day job and become a full-time writer.

Like Verne, I started out on a pragmatic path. I spent years becoming a programmer, thinking it would be a pretty reasonable creative outlet, and when I found myself spending countless hours debugging code, I had a creative crisis as I remembered a friend’s comment to “never lose my creativity”. And so, like some of you, I began night classes in art and design, 20-some years ago. You may be graduating today, but it’s not the end of your growth and learning. Keep identifying where you want to grow, and keep growing! Take more classes, change careers if you need to, keep challenging yourselves. Never stop striving for better things. Keep thinking about: What are your inspirations, motivations, and dreams? Keep moving forward to them. Never give up on those dreams. They’ll keep you alive and excited.

But creativity is not something you are, it’s something you do. You have to work at it. The mundane aspects of life will creep up on you constantly, whether they’re the pressures of work or the distractions of American Idol and Facebook. You’ve spent years in this program building great strengths in creative disciplines. You have to be vigilant to keep reviving that spirit.

I was recently thinking about what it would be like to go back twenty or so years and visit my young self, around your age. I think I always worried when I was young that I’d be disappointed with how I turned out. And now I think, no, my young self would be very happy with how things have worked out. I have a wonderful wife and child who I love, I have the job of my dreams, I’ve done the things I wanted to do. But, I think the main thing my young self would be surprised by is ...he would say “Wow, why was it so hard getting there?” Who would have imagined all the challenges, all the barriers, all the hard work, all the times I had to keep proving myself.

For example, I went through the dot com bust in 2001 while I was running my own business, and we lost a lot of business because a lot of our clients went out of business and we lost a lot of money which had to be earned back over time. Then in 2003, my business partner had a ski accident, and he struggled with a brain injury for a year before he died. I wasn’t ready for those kinds of troubles, but if you keep working through them, you’ll get through to the other side.

You’re going to face plenty of these challenges and obstacles, but be persistent. My hero in this regard is Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. You all know him. He’s passionate, driven, and committed to making a positive change with his work. He loves innovation. He brings an intense perfection and integrity to his design of products like the iPod and iPhone. But what impresses me most is what he went through in business to learn his lessons. He founded Apple but was kicked out. He started NeXT, an amazingly innovative computer company, and had to scale back incredibly when the computers they made didn’t sell enough. He sunk most of his remaining fortune into Pixar, and almost ran out of money when Pixar didn’t bring back much revenue. In the final hour, before running out of money, Pixar got a Disney contract. In the final hour, NeXT was sold to Apple. Jobs came back to Apple understanding what it means to nearly lose everything, and he’d learned the hard lessons that make him a business giant today.

Jobs started his career with a vision to transform the world by giving everyday people access to computers. Bring your own vision to your work and look for ways you can give something to the world. Inspire people. Make a difference. In my design agency, for example, we created websites that were accessible for people with disabilities. They were designed so that blind people could browse sites even though they couldn’t view the images. We even launched a spinoff company that helped other companies make their websites more accessible. I had a blind man visit our offices once and tell me he was delighted at how easy all of our websites were to navigate. I said, we haven’t done anything special, just follow some basic guidelines, and he said, of course you’ve done something special; most websites are difficult or impossible to navigate for blind people.

Art and design are most fulfilling for you, the creator, when they serve others. In this regard, one of my artistic heroes is Hayao Miyazaki, the animator who created Studio Ghibli and amazing movies like Nausicaa, Princess Mononoke, Totoro, and Spirited Away. If you haven’t seen his movies, you definitely should. Miyazaki’s movies are beautifully animated, but more than that, they reflect his values. Every one of his movies is filled with positive attitudes, enthusiasm, and joy for living. He frequently includes environmental themes, and he’s a committed feminist. This is so cool! Most of his movies feature a female lead who is confident, capable, and inspiring. He really uses his creative skills to change the attitudes of people in the world for the better.

You can follow your creative vision for a whole lot of reasons, and I hope all of those reasons continue to inspire you. But most of all, I hope you do everything because you love people.

People are surprising and fascinating and amazing.. Do good for people. Learn about people. Have passion for people, and you’ll always be happy with your art and with yourselves.

Thank you and good luck with everything.

I know many of you were convinced last night at about six o’clock local time the world was going to come to an end. Just because it hasn’t doesn’t mean that it’s not nearby because my appearing today at Yale University is surely one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

Today is your day. Please, do not turn off your electronic devices. Leave your iPhone, your iPad, your Sidekicks, your Droids, your blackberries powered up, recording, photographing, texting out all that emerges from this stage over the next few minutes.

Later on today you can compare your tweets and your Facebook comments with those of others to figure out if anything memorable went down. You know what, tweet that last sentence I just said. Take this speech and set it to music and maybe insert some crazy kooky graphics. Starin' that video yourself and post on the web and if it becomes a viral sensation you’ll be equal to any cat playing with a paper bag or any set of twin toddlers talking gibberish to each other, as popular as that cute girl that sings about Fridays.

Just one of the possibilities in our brave new world, the world you now inherit whether you’d like it or not. The jig is up.

The clock has run out and the future with a capital ‘F’ now rests with all of you all because you went to Yale. You are now the anointed, the charge holders, the best and brightest. Each of you is a shining hope for our nation in the world. You are the new wizards who can finally make sense of all the delta vectors and square roots and divided by’s out there that we call the human race. The generations before you came of age took on the job and now it’s your turn.

I once had a friend, who had a rich uncle, who promised to pay for his college as long as my friend wished to stay in school. “You should stay in school as long as you can”the rich uncle said “because when you get out of college you’ve got to work every day for the rest of your life.” You all will come to understand what that rich uncle meant, just as surely as you will someday wonder where the hell you put your reading glasses and yell at your own kids to turn the damn music down.

On spring days like today, it’s traditional for us to ponder the state of the world and implore you all to help make it a better place which implies that things are somehow worse today than they were when we were sitting where you are right now.I’m not so sure the planet earth is in worse shape than it was 30, no 18, no four years ago.

That’s not to say it’s in better shape either. Refraining from waxing nostalgic and comparing our then to your now and avoiding any talk of “You kids these days with your rap and your ‘hip-hopin’ and your ‘snoopy dogg daddies with the diddy pops’, with your “fiddy” cents and your quarter cents…”

That sober look shows that just as world has gotten to be a better place after all, and has also grown a bit worse at the exact same rate. A one step up and one step back, sort of cosmic balance between forward progress and cultural retreat that puts mankind on the bell curve of existence. That shows a small segment in joy, ease and comfort while an equal portion struggle on with little hope in the fortunes of the remainder, either on the rise or on the wane in this confounding tide of so many damn things that we grow oblivious to the shifts in the quality of our lives.

Graduation Day is the proper occasion to put a toe in the global waters and I think the mercury shows that things are much as they always have been. Ten years ago we busied ourselves with trivial stuff imbued with importance and then came 9/11.

In 1991 riches were created in new businesses that had never existed. Then that economic balloon burst.In ’81 I had a great job on T.V. and in ’82 Bosom Buddies was cancelled. In ‘71 color T.V. in more living rooms than ever showed young Americans still fighting in combat in Vietnam and in ‘61 satellites beamed live images around the world for the very first time but those images were of the building of the Berlin Wall.

This ten-year grid shows the same yin yang thing; I’m trying to copyright that. It shows the same yin yang thing.

We all have these devices that can make a permanent record of revolutionary change on the other side of the globe as well as hate filled diatribes from across town. Fewer and fewer in our country go to bed hungry but do you see how obesity now affects half of our population?

No matter how many bargains we find at the local You-Mart many of us still struggle to pay the rent and the utilities. Our country is no longer in physical or even ideological war with our enemies, for most of the last century, but in the 11 and half years of the third millennium our armed forces have been fighting in the field for nine of them. Purchasing intellectual property and the work of artists we admire is a simple as clicking a mouse and paying less than a few bucks. Which means you may find that there is no guarantee in making a living at your chosen discipline.

Now some advantages particular to this age are not to be denied. Boredom seems to have been vanquished. There is always something to do, but hasn’t this translated into a perpetual distraction in our lives, in the bathroom, at the dinner table, in the back seat, at a wedding, at a graduation day? There’s always something to check, something to tweet, something to watch, something to download, something to share, something to buy, someone on a voice mail, something to yank at our attention span and it’s all in the palm of our hand for a small monthly service fee.

That same technology has allowed for a surplus of celebrities and that is nothing to cheer about. Anyone can enjoy the perks of notoriety now and the duration of fame has been lengthened from Andy Warhol’s brief 15 minutes to a good 15 months if you’re willing to do certain things on camera.

Though Orwellian language is often the vocabulary of official new speak his boogie man that was the all-seeing big brother has never emerged unless you live in NorthKorea or run a red light in BeverlyHills or shop online or have done something stupid in the wrong place at the wrong time in front of someone with a camera and their cell phone and that is everybody. So actually there is a big brother but he’s not a malevolent fiction; he’s actually all of us, who lives in our search engines.

So no matter how many times I do the calculations I come up with the social draw. The positives balance the negatives. The x’s equal the y’s and our hopes weigh as much as our fears but I hesitate on that last one because fear, good lord, fear is a powerful physiological force of 2011.

We here up in stands and surrounding you graduating class look to you as we do every year, hoping you will now somehow through your labors free us from what we have come to fear and we have come to fear many things. Fear has become the commodity that sells as certainly as sex.

Fear is cheap. Fear is easy. Fear gets attention. Fear is spread as fast as gossip and is just as glamorous, juicy and profitable.Fear twist facts into fictions that become indistinguishable from ignorance. Fear is a profit-churning goto with the whole market being your whole family.

I was sitting at the house one day, watching the game on T.V.not long ago and along came this promo for the local nightly news. “Are our schools poisoning our children!? That story and summer’s hottest bikinis tonight at 11:00.” In that I had school-age kids at the time I feared that they were in fact being poisoned at school and summer was still a few weeks away. So I tuned in to get the scoop and the actual news story of that news broadcast was this. A certain supply of hamburger was found to have a bit too much of a particular bacteria in it and for safety’s sake was being taken off the market. That same hamburger was slated for sale to an out of state school system for its cafeterias but it was recalled in time. So answering that news program’s own question, no our schools were not poisoning our children but yes that summer there would be some very hot bikinis at the beach.

The early American naval commander John Paul Jones said “If fear is cultivated it will become stronger. If faith is cultivated it will achieve mastery.” and this is why I’m a big fan of history because observations in the American colonies over 200 years ago by Nathan Hale, who lived in that building right over there, translate word for word of the United States in 2011, “For I take that fear to be fear in large-scale. Fear itself intimidating and constant and I take faith to be what we hold in ourselves, our American ideal of self-determination.”

Fear is whispered in our ears and shouted in our faces. Faith must be fostered by the man or woman you see every day in the mirror. The former forever snaps at our heels and delays our course. The latter can spur our boot heels to be wandering, stimulate our creativity and drive us forward. Fear or faith, which will be our master?

Three men found that they could no longer sleep because of their deep seeded fears. This is a story I’m telling. Their lives were in a state of stasis because of their constant worries. So they set out on a pilgrimage to find a wiseman who lived high in the mountain, so high up above the tree line that no vegetation grew, no animals lived, not even insects could be found so high up in the mountains in that thin air. When they reached his cave the first of the three said “Help me Wiseman for my fear has crippled me.” “What is your fear?” asked the Wiseman. “I fear death.” said the pilgrim. “I wonder when it is going to come for me.” “Death” said the wise men “let me take away this fear my friend. Death will not come to call until you are ready for its embrace. Know that and your fear will go away.” This calmed that pilgrim’s mind and he feared death no longer.

The Wiseman then turned to the second pilgrim and said “What is it you fear my friend?” “I fear my new neighbors.” said the second pilgrim.“They are strangers who observe holy days different than mine. They have way too many kids. They play music that sounds like noise.” “Strangers” said the Wiseman, “I will take away this fear my friend. Return to your home and make a cake for your new neighbors. Bring toys to their children. Join them in their songs and learn their ways and you will become familiar with these neighbors and your fear will go away.” When the second man saw the wisdom in the simple instructions he knew he would no longer fear the family who were his neighbors.

There in the cave so high in the mountains that nothing could live, the Wiseman turned to the last pilgrim and asked of his fear. “Oh Wiseman, I fear spiders. WhenI try to sleep at night I imagine spiders dropping from the ceiling and crawling upon my flesh and I cannot rest.” “Spiders” said the Wiseman, “no shit why do you think I live way up here.”

Fear will get the worst of the best of us and peddlers of influence count on that. Throughout our nation’s constant struggle to create a more perfect union, establish justice and assure our domestic tranquility, we battle fear from outside our borders, from within our own hearts every day of our history. Our nation came to be despite fear of retribution for treason from a kingdom across the sea. America was made strong and diverse because here people could live free from the fears that made up their daily lives in whatever land they called the old country.

Our history books tell of the conflicts taken up to free people from fear, those kept in slavery in our own states and deliberate whole nations under the rule of tyrants and theologies rooted in fear.

The American cause, at its best, has been the cultivation of a faith that declares we will all live in peace when we are all free to worship as we choose, when we are free to express our hearts and when we all seek a place free from fear but we live in the world where too many of us are too ready to believe in things that do not exist, conspiracies. Divisions are constructed, the differences between us are not celebrated for making us stronger but are calculated and programed to set us against each other.

Our faith is tested by unpredictable providence and threatened when common sense is corrupted by specific interests speaking from 54 years of experience the work towards a more perfect union isa never ending concern. It involves each and every one of us. Evidence that our nation is becoming a better place is everywhere but each new day fear is, as the Jersey poet said, “Lurking in the darkness on the edge of town.”

Your rising from bed every morning will give fear it’s chance to grow stronger just as it will afford faith its chance to blossom. You will make the choice to react to one or create the other and because you are smart enough to earn your place on this college day at Yale University you will sense the moment and you will know what to do.

In the meantime ponder this front. In the struggle against ceaseless fear and its ceaseless flow, in the coming months and years veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will finally come home for good after so many tours. Some after many tours that wore the body and the soul and spilled a great portion of their lives. For all of them, after a long time spent far away in the harsh realm of war, they’ve returned different from what they were when they left. Surely their faith in themselves is shadowed by a fear of not knowing what is expected of them next.

No matter what your view of those wars over there you can affect the future of our nation right here by taking their fears head on. You can imprint the very next pages of the history of our troubled world by reinforcing the faith of those returning veterans, allowing them to rest, aiding in their recovery, if possible their complete recovery.

So let those of us who watched and debated their long deployments serve them now as they served when they were asked and as they were ordered. Let’s provide for them their place free from fear by educating them if they can learn, by employing them as they transition from soldier back to citizen and by empathizing with the new journey they’re starting even though we will never fully understand the journey they just completed. We all will define the true nature of our American identity, not by the parades and the welcome home parties but how we match their time in the service with service of our own.

Give it four years, as many years as you’ve spent here at Yale. In acts both proactive and spontaneous and do the things you can to free veterans from the new uncertainty that awaits them, from the mysterious fears they will face the day after they come home. Cultivate in them the faith to carry on and they will do the rest.

Your work begins, work that will not be always joyful to you, labor that may not always fulfill you and days that will seem like one damn thing after the other.

It’s true you will now work every day for the rest of your lives, that full-time job, your career as human beings and as Americans and as graduates of Yale is to stand on the fulcrum between fear and faith, fear at your back, faith in front of you.

Which way will you lean? Which way will you move? Move forward, ever forward and tweet out a picture of the results. It may make you famous.

Thank you and congratulations.

Thanks, thank you.

This is a pretty amazing situation here because I am some place I used to dream about when I was a kid.

Now I was lucky as you all are and I know, Dean, that you thanked the parents but I want to turn the lights up on the parents one more time so you can see what I’m saying to you and that I mean from my heart.

The fact that you did not deride your children for their dreams, the fact that you bit whatever was going to come out of your mouth, you swallowed it, you said,“Okay and I hope this works out for you. You know you never want to work but okay…” I want you to look at what you have produced. These are your children. You did this and I’m saying to you “Thank you.” You did this.

Let me tell you something. I was really lucky. I had really weird mother. She also had another really weird child but I was the weirder of the two. Basically she said to me, “Well, it’s ok if you’re weird. Are you willing to pay the price for it?” and I was like, “I don’t know what you mean.” because I was just me. She said,“You realize that not everybody is going to get you, not everybody is going to see what you see, not everybody’s going to feel what you feel and you can talk until you’re white in the face. They still may not get it and not only may they not get it, they may not like you. When it’s all said and done, are you prepared to take that on, in order to stay an individual?”

It seemed to me that it was easier to be an individual, less people were screaming at you. Most of the time people would just step away from you. When I was a kid I dreamed of this place, a place where film and media and liberal arts and design and fashion and architecture could live because you see these were all things I was interested in.

I couldn’t read because I was dyslexic and didn’t learn until I was fifteen but I knew what I saw. I knew what I felt. I knew what I wanted to do.

I’m so pleased to be here. I know I’ve done this a bit butt backwards so I want to thank the school and all the adults. I’m not sure that you are an adult, Dean, I’m just not sure. I’m supposed to say something witty and smart to you. Well, I have to say witty and smart and keep it clean.

Here’s whatI think, if you believe in what you’re doing do it. It’s hard. There are not a lot of people these days that seem to understand it. It’s where high schools and grammar schools are having such a hard time. These arts are not looked upon as necessities but they are, for kids like me who couldn’t articulate what they needed to do. The arts were my way of speaking.

For people who may not be able to say exactly what they mean they can draw it. It’s a way of communicating and if we cut it off then we are more than barbarians because we know better.

You all have a lot of things you want to do and you’ll get some of them done. Some of them you’re not going to get done but you’ve got to be flexible, baby, because this is a great room to be in but once you’re out there you’re going to have to learn how to play well with others. I tell you this from experience.

I am on a show now where I have had to learn to be flexible in my thinking, to hear the other opinion, in case even though they’re wrong all the other times, in case there is something fantastic being said. You don’t know everything.

You’re prepared for much but you’ve got to learn a lot once you step out of these doors. If you’re lucky enough to have made friends with folks in the schools then you’ve got a little bit of a support system.

Don’t be afraid to ask the question, “What do you mean?” Don’t be afraid to say, “I created this this way and this is why and I know you want to give me a lot of money but you want too much.” because those are the decisions are going to have to make, when to compromise how to compromise, if to compromise at all. You’re the big hot stuff right now but you’re entering into a whole new group and you have to hold your own. You cannot hold your own if you’re rigid. You have to be able to serve.

Stand up for what you believe in. It’s okay to be wrong. It’s okay to know stuff in your heart and discover that you were wrong and comp to it. Say,“You know what? I’ve changed my mind. This has become a terrible thing to do in this country and only art can bring it back.”

There is nothing wrong with continued growth, with evolution it’s part of the process. Just because you’re here now doesn’t mean that’s where you’re going to end up. It’s a great ride. There are so many great things to do and if it’s in you, you won’t be able to do it any other way.

Sure you could try to go work at a bank but all of those checks that you’re looking at are going to have doodles on them. You’d be writing plays on the back of people’s contracts in the lawyer’s office because it’s just there. It’s in you.

I’m knocked out by you all and so jealous. I would give anything to live this moment. I’ve never done this. I wasn’t school material. In the old days, when I was a kid, they said “No she should be in the slow class.” because they didn’t have words for what was wrong with me but it didn’t seem to stop me.

Believe and be you. Be unique. Be prepared to be alone sometimes when you’re unique. It’s not a bad thing. You could travel with the sheep, follow everybody else’s stuff but then you’re not you. I guess if I want to say anything it’s “Be you.” Be true to you and that should make the ride a little more interesting.

I could do a big finish. This is the thing that happens when I’m talking from here. If I talk from here it’s like, okay that’s it. When I’m talking from the B.S.place I could have you laughing for days but I just figured I want to say thank you for letting me come and letting me talk to you about my strangeness and my desire to see you take the world by storm.

I’m so proud to be with you all, and to all the teachers, bravo.

Thank you very much.  Madam Chancellor, members of the Board of Trustees, members of the faculty and administration, parents and friends, honored guests and graduates, thank you for inviting me to speak today at this magnificent Commencement ceremony.

There’s a story about a man and a woman who have been married for 40 years.  One evening at dinner the woman turns to her husband and says, “You know, 40 years ago on our wedding day you told me that you loved me and you haven’t said those words since.” They sit in silence for a long moment before the husband says “If I change my mind, I’ll let you know.”

Well, it’s been a long time since I sat where you sit, and I can remember looking up at my teachers with great admiration, with fondness, with gratitude and with love. Some of the teachers who were there that day are here this day and I wanted to let them know that I haven’t changed my mind.

There’s another story. Two newborn babies are lying side by side in the hospital and they glance at each other.  Ninety years later, through a remarkable coincidence, the two are back in the same hospital lying side by side in the same hospital room.  They look at each other and one of them says, “So what’d you think?” 

It’s going to be a very long time before you have to answer that question, but time shifts gears right now and starts to gain speed.  Just ask your parents whose heads, I promise you, are exploding right now.  They think they took you home from the maternity ward last month.  They think you learned how to walk last week.  They don’t understand how you could possibly be getting a degree in something today.   They listened to “Cats in the Cradle” the whole car ride here.

I’d like to say to the parents that I realized something while I was writing this speech: the last teacher your kids will have in college will be me.  And that thought scared the hell out of me. Frankly, you should feel exactly the same way.  But I am the father of an 11-year-old daughter, so I do know how proud you are today, how proud your daughters and your sons make you every day, and that they did just learn how to walk last week, that you’ll never not be there for them, that you love them more than they’ll ever know and that it doesn’t matter how many degrees get put in their hand, they will always be dumber than you are.

And make no mistake about it, you are dumb.  You’re a group of incredibly well-educated dumb people.  I was there.  We all were there.  You’re barely functional.  There are some screw-ups headed your way.  I wish I could tell you that there was a trick to avoiding the screw-ups, but the screw-ups, they’re a-coming for ya.  It’s a combination of life being unpredictable, and you being super dumb.

Today is May 13th and today you graduate.  Growing up, I looked at my future as a timeline of graduations in which every few years, I’d be given more freedom and reward as I passed each milestone of childhood.  When I get my driver’s license, my life will be like this; when I’m a senior, my life will be like that; when I go off to college, my life will be like this; when I move out of the dorms, my life will be like that; and then finally, graduation.  And on graduation day, I had only one goal left, and that was to be part of professional theater.  We have this in common, you and I—we want to be able to earn a living doing what we love.  Whether you’re a writer, mathematician, engineer, architect, butcher, baker or candlestick maker, you want an invitation to the show.

Today is May 13th, and today you graduate, and today you already know what I know: to get where you’re going, you have to be good, and to be good where you’re going, you have to be damned good.  Every once in a while, you’ll succeed.  Most of the time you’ll fail, and most of the time the circumstances will be well beyond your control. 

When we were casting my first movie, “A Few Good Men,” we saw an actor just 10 months removed from the theater training program at UCLA.  We liked him very much and we cast him in a small, but featured role as an endearingly dimwitted Marine corporal.  The actor had been working as a Domino’s Pizza delivery boy for 10 months, so the news that he’d just landed his first professional job and that it was in a new movie that Rob Reiner was directing, starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, was met with happiness. But as is often the case in show business, success begets success before you’ve even done anything, and a week later the actor’s agent called.  The actor had been offered the lead role in a new, as-yet-untitled Milos Forman film.  He was beside himself.  He felt loyalty to the first offer, but Forman after all was offering him the lead.  We said we understood, no problem, good luck, we’ll go with our second choice.  Which, we did.  And two weeks later, the Milos Forman film was scrapped.  Our second choice, who was also making his professional debut, was an actor named Noah Wyle.  Noah would go on to become one of the stars of the television series “ER” and hasn’t stopped working since.  I don’t know what the first actor is doing, and I can’t remember his name.  Sometimes, just when you think you have the ball safely in the end zone, you’re back to delivering pizzas for Domino’s.  Welcome to the NFL.

In the summer of 1983, after I graduated, I moved to New York to begin my life as a struggling writer.  I got a series of survival jobs that included bartending, ticket-taking, telemarketing, limo driving, and dressing up as a moose to pass out leaflets in a mall.  I ran into a woman who’d been a senior here when I was a freshman.  I asked her how it was going and how she felt Syracuse had prepared her for the early stages of her career.  She said, “Well, the thing is, after three years you start to forget everything they taught you in college.  But once you’ve done that, you’ll be fine.”  I laughed because I thought it was funny and also because I wanted to ask her out, but I also think she was wrong.

As a freshman drama student—and this story is now becoming famous—I had a play analysis class—it was part of my requirement.  The professor was Gerardine Clark. If anybody was wondering, the drama students are sitting over there.  The play analysis class met for 90 minutes twice a week.  We read two plays a week and we took a 20-question true or false quiz at the beginning of the session that tested little more than whether or not we’d read the play.  The problem was that the class was at 8:30 in the morning, it met all the way down on East Genesee, I lived all the way up at Brewster/Boland, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but from time to time the city of Syracuse experiences inclement weather.  All this going to class and reading and walking through snow, wind chill that’s apparently powered by jet engines, was having a negative effect on my social life in general and my sleeping in particular.  At one point, being quizzed on “Death of a Salesman,” a play I had not read, I gave an answer that indicated that I wasn’t aware that at the end of the play the salesman dies.  And I failed the class.  I had to repeat it my sophomore year; it was depressing, frustrating and deeply embarrassing.    And it was without a doubt the single most significant event that occurred in my evolution as a writer.  I showed up my sophomore year and I went to class, and I paid attention, and we read plays and I paid attention, and we discussed structure and tempo and intention and obstacle, possible improbabilities, improbable impossibilities, and I paid attention, and by God when I got my grades at the end of the year, I’d turned that F into a D.  I’m joking: it was pass/fail.

But I stood at the back of the Eisenhower Theater at the Kennedy Center in Washington watching a pre-Broadway tryout of my plays, knowing that when the curtain came down, I could go back to my hotel room and fix the problem in the second act with the tools that Gerry Clark gave me.  Eight years ago, I was introduced to Arthur Miller at a Dramatists Guild function and we spent a good part of the evening talking.  A few weeks later when he came down with the flu he called and asked if I could fill in for him as a guest lecturer at NYU.  The subject was “Death of a Salesman.”  You made a good decision coming to school here. 

I’ve made some bad decisions.  I lost a decade of my life to cocaine addiction.  You know how I got addicted to cocaine?  I tried it.  The problem with drugs is that they work, right up until the moment that they decimate your life.  Try cocaine, and you’ll become addicted to it.  Become addicted to cocaine, and you will either be dead, or you will wish you were dead, but it will only be one or the other.  My big fear was that I wasn’t going to be able to write without it.  There was no way I was going to be able to write without it.  Last year I celebrated my 11-year anniversary of not using coke. Thank you.  In that 11 years, I’ve written three television series, three movies, a Broadway play, won the Academy Award and taught my daughter all the lyrics to “Pirates of Penzance.”  I have good friends. 

You’ll meet a lot of people who, to put it simply, don’t know what they’re talking about.  In 1970 a CBS executive famously said that there were four things that we would never, ever see on television: a divorced person, a Jewish person, a person living in New York City and a man with a moustache.  By 1980, every show on television was about a divorced Jew who lives in New York City and goes on a blind date with Tom Selleck.

Develop your own compass, and trust it.  Take risks, dare to fail, remember the first person through the wall always gets hurt.  My junior and senior years at Syracuse, I shared a five-bedroom apartment at the top of East Adams with four roommates, one of whom was a fellow theater major named Chris. Chris was a sweet guy with a sly sense of humor and a sunny stage presence.  He was born out of his time, and would have felt most at home playing Mickey Rooney’s sidekick in “Babes on Broadway.”  I had subscriptions back then to Time and Newsweek.  Chris used to enjoy making fun of what he felt was an odd interest in world events that had nothing to do with the arts.  I lost touch with Chris after we graduated and so I’m not quite certain when he died. But I remember about a year and a half after the last time I saw him, I read an article in Newsweek about a virus that was burning its way across the country. The Centers for Disease Control was calling it “Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome” or AIDS for short. And they were asking the White House for $35 million for research, care and cure.  The White House felt that $35 million was way too much money to spend on a disease that was only affecting homosexuals, and they passed. Which I’m sure they wouldn’t have done if they’d known that $35 million was a steal compared to the $2 billion it would cost only 10 years later.

Am I saying that Chris would be alive today if only he’d read Newsweek? Of course not. But it seems to me that more and more we’ve come to expect less and less of each other, and that’s got to change. Your friends, your family, this school expect more of you than vocational success. 

Today is May 13th and today you graduate and the rules are about to change, and one of them is this: Decisions are made by those who show up. Don’t ever forget that you’re a citizen of this world.

Don’t ever forget that you’re a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day. Civility, respect, kindness, character. You’re too good for schadenfreude, you’re too good for gossip and snark, you’re too good for intolerance—and since you’re walking into the middle of a presidential election, it’s worth mentioning that you’re too good to think people who disagree with you are your enemy. Unless they went to Georgetown, in which case, they can go to hell.

Don’t ever forget that a small group of thoughtful people can change the world. It’s the only thing that ever has.

Rehearsal’s over. You’re going out there now, you’re going to do this thing. How you live matters. You’re going to fall down, but the world doesn’t care how many times you fall down, as long as it’s one fewer than the number of times you get back up.

For the class of 2012, I wish you joy. I wish you health and happiness and success, I wish you a roof, four walls, a floor and someone in your life that you care about more than you care about yourself. Someone who makes you start saying “we” where before you used to say “I” and “us” where you used to say “me.” I wish you the quality of friends I have and the quality of colleagues I work with.  Baseball players say they don’t have to look to see if they hit a home run, they can feel it. So I wish for you a moment—a moment soon—when you really put the bat on the ball, when you really get a hold of one and drive it into the upper deck, when you feel it. When you aim high and hit your target, when just for a moment all else disappears, and you soar with wings as eagles. The moment will end as quickly as it came, and so you’ll have to have it back, and so you’ll get it back no matter what the obstacles.  A lofty prediction, to be sure, but I flat out guarantee it.

Today is May 13th, and today you graduate, and my friends, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.  Thank you, and congratulations.

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a-breakin’ in my soul

When I’m singing this age-old American hymn I’m surrounded by an image of a dark morning sky opening to the light of a new day. I feel the immediacy of Beauty, I feel those first moments of morning light, and at the same time I feel the magnitude of the Eternal, I feel the rhythm of a night sky surrendering to day… after day after day, year after year. It’s a song of commencing for a day of commencing. So why is it that I named my Commencement speech Obituary? Why is it that with this precious 20 minutes I have with the 2012 Colorado College graduating class, with you incredibly well-equipped, beautiful, curious, courageous, adventuresome students I’m choosing to focus on Death?

At the time I started to really dig in and think about what to say to you today, I was pacing back and forth in the living room at my house and I noticed a Whitney Houston album sitting on the coffee table. It was my total favorite album when I was a kid. Given the news recently that she had passed away I was paying homage to her by reconnecting with my inner-12-year-old that used to sing her songs into the imaginary microphone in my Midwestern childhood living room, when, of course no one was home…

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children’s laughter remind us how we used to be
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone’s shadow

-I bet you didn’t think I’d go for the high note…then again, maybe you prefer the dance hit-

ooooh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me

-and the best part-

Somebody ­who, somebody who, somebody who lo-o-oves me 

I bet you didn’t vote me in to give this speech today to sing late-80s pop songs… it’s just that in my pacing back and forth in my living room that day I couldn’t help but think about the contrast of that 1980’s pastel-bordered-hyper-crisp photo of Whitney Houston’s youthful, vibrant smile with what undoubtedly is her current physical state … And I should say right now that I am going to share with you today a lot about how my mind works some of which I maybe shouldn’t, nonetheless you it’s your fault, you voted me in and I’m gonna give you what I got.  Soooo, I pictured worms slithering up to the surface through her decaying eye sockets and loam and soil pushing softly and ceaselessly against the wooden box cradling her skull, and a body deflated, empty, surrendering to the earth. Whitney Houston is now being folded back in moment after moment, day after day year after year until at some point her body will no longer be recognizable and perhaps even the memory of her will have vanished completely. 

Envisioning Whitney Houston in her grave was likely prompted by an incredibly uplifting experience I had at a workshop a few weeks earlier. I had the massive good fortune to be invited to a day of counseling by a group of people that have made their life’s work teaching artists and people in creative fields to Thrive rather than strive and they’ve had great success. I remember the moment when the leader of the workshop said, “You will envision here and now what you want to achieve in your lifetime and then you will come up with a plan to move toward realizing those achievements, you will take action and you will succeed.” And the co-leader of the workshop, a Native American male artist of the Choctaw & Cherokee tribes then chimed in and said, “I was poor, deeply in debt, living my art but always struggling to get by. My dream was to be able to live my art without struggle. Now, I have 3 commissions for several million dollars. I no longer live in fear of struggle. And now I see that my dreams can also include helping the broader community of Native American artists… and in this moment, you.” The 20 creative people in the room sighed audibly. Was it possible that we could not just forever live as struggling artists? The workshop leaders handed out a workbook and said, “Fill this out and your dreams will start to come true.” I opened the workbook and the page is filled with blank lines for me to fill in… and at the top of the page is written, “Obituary”.

They gave us 5 minutes and told us to write freely, fluidly and without judgment. So, here it is, I’m sharing it with you, uncensored sloppy free-writing and all:

Obituary: Abigail Washburn

She helped to create a world that thru communal efforts began a massive re-direction of the world’s wealth and energy toward the realization of beauty and harmony and ceased all violent behavior between nations and people by spurring the creation of local and international cultural events cementing the victory of soulful globalization over the powers of individual and corporate gain. Meanwhile she managed to help facilitate a fully integrated home and community where all inspiration is sourced for overcoming the greater challenges in the world thereby spreading an undeniable and magnetic draw toward beauty and light. When she died she passed into a love and light painted, sewn, stitched and sung by the dear people and places that graced her path.

Writing freely, fluidly and without judgment, that’s what came out of me. If I read that right I think I basically want World Peace before I die. And if the workshop leaders are right, I’m gonna do it. I’m standing here thinking… yea right, how am I going to create World Peace?

This is where I thank you from the bottom of my heart for asking me to speak to you today, not only is it a tremendous honor that you actually want to hear what I have to say, but also because it’s forced me to face my Obituary and it’s compelling me to try to figure out what I think I can actually pull off in my lifetime. I’m going to share 3 personal stories with you in an effort to explore the likelihood of me fulfilling my dreams.

Story #1 

Before I left CC, I worked grounds crew for the summer (anybody working grounds’ crew this summer?), then followed my boyfriend at the time and his bluegrass band, all CC kids, to Vermont. We set up shop in the small town of Montpelier and got day jobs. Although I sang in Ellement (shout out ladies), I wasn’t in the band and never dreamed of being a professional musician. I got a job as an assistant lobbyist at the State House and knew that eventually I wanted to use my CC degree in Asian Studies to help US-China Relations. I passed the HSK (the Chinese equivalency exam) and readied myself to move to China to go to Beijing University law school. One night several months before I left Vermont I heard an LP of Doc Watson singing and playing Shady Grove. 

Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my darlin’
Shady Grove my little love
Goin’ back to Harlan

After spending my CC years being obsessed with the immense richness of Chinese culture, it was a profound relief to hear something so beautiful and so American. It was for me the sound of Home. I knew I needed to get an old-time banjo and take it with me to China.  Being the adventuresome CC grad fearing a future spent in a cubicle in a law office, I took advantage of my remaining time in the US and headed out on a massive road trip of the east coast including 5 days of insight meditation, a solo backpacking mission along the Appalachian trail, a visit to CC friends in NYC, and as I hit the Blue Ridge I started the musical portion of my journey with a visit to a fiddler’s gathering in West Virginia, then North Carolina for a banjo lesson, and last stop Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. On the last night of the convention a couple of young women asked me to jam and I timidly played the 4 songs I had picked up along my journey … AND, wouldn’t you know it, a record executive walked up to me and asked me to come to Nashville, TN to make a record.

Story #2

Nowadays people say to me things like, “You’re a natural born performer.” I’m gonna tell you something, I am not a natural born performer. The first time I got on stage to perform for people singing and playing banjo, I had only been playing for a few months and I only knew just enough songs. I was very very very very afraid. My particular nervousness affliction is to feel like I have to pee. And I go back and forth to the bathroom over and over again until I think surely there’s nothing left. So, I’m backstage, it’s my first festival performance, 10 minute countdown to stage call and I’m stuck to the port-a-potty. Show starts, I’m on stage, I strum a chord, sing my first few notes and what happens? I pee down my leg. Mortified is an understatement. Luckily I had enough wits about me to realize that the audience was too far away to notice. I kept going. I finished the show I found paper towels, a bottle of water, a private spot backstage and I cleaned myself up and went out to the merch table to greet people.

Story #3

In my first year on the road, I was given the opportunity to do an opening slot in South Carolina for a Texas singer song-writer with an audience of folks ready to drink a beer, party down and sing a good ol’Texas song. Unbeknownst to me at the time, opening acts are often just a tool to fill time while the audience shows up late and gets drunk before the main act starts. So, I get out on stage and first thing, I dig into a lively banjo tune. I immediately notice that there are only a handful of people actually there at 8pm… and that handful of people stand at the foot of the stage and talk loudly, shouting out drink orders as their friends walk toward the bar. Several songs into my set the crowd is growing, and even fewer people are listening. I decide to cut my between-song-banter short, and say, “This next one is an original song in Chinese, it’s a story about how hard it is to be an immigrant in America.”

我，我是一只迷途的羔羊
谁能引我走出迷茫
哪有我重生的希望
噢牧羊人啊
噢牧羊人啊 

I wish I could tell you that everyone actually shut up and listened at this point, but in fact, only one small group of guys up front turned around and said something like, “Holy crap man, I think that girl’s singing in Japanese.” They start laughing and making slant eyes. And that’s when suddenly everything stopped. I was suspended, like in a kung fu movie when everything literally hangs in the air, floating… my third eye popped wide open. I looked around at the South Carolina party and I looked at myself on stage and at first I felt anger, and then I felt sorry for myself and THEN somehow it all started to a turn toward funny, really funny –

Here I was singing a dramatic original a capella song in mandarin Chinese to a pile of really drunk people wanting to party down to songs with titles like “I Want to check you for Ticks”, or “Dropkick me Jesus Thru the Goalposts of Life” or “Momma Get a Hammer {There’s a Fly on Daddy’s Head}” or the crowd favorite “You Ain’t Much Fun Since I Quit Drinkin”.  Needless to say I became distinctly aware that this was an un-ideal setting for my music and I was in the middle of a Test with a capital T.  ffffmp, back into my body, next song up and I finished out my set. After a very weak applause from about a tenth of the audience I walked off stage and stood by the merch booth at the back of the room. CD sales were what we call in the industry ‘slim’, reaching a total of 0. The only interaction I had was an occasional point and stare from a small group, and one drunk guy who came up to me and said, “You may not have noticed but I was watching you. That was just weird.” That was the first of 5 more shows to go.

I tell you these 3 fresh-out-of-college stories because I know they hold important hard-earned lessons that have helped to set my footsteps down a path that is determining my future. So, in an effort to share, here’s what I think I’ve learned:

An open heart and curious mind creates miracles. I believe we discover our true calling not because we intellectually know what it is (even if we think we do) but because we are curious enough & open enough to be found by our true calling.

Fear arises as a sign to let us know we are ready. We are ready for a new challenge.  When we feel fear at doing something… it very likely means that it’s exactly the thing we need to.

And lastly, obstacles arise to help us prepare for what we are here to do in this world. Obstacles are tests. Luckily the outcome of making it through these tests is that challenge after challenge we grow stronger and stronger and continually morph into the vessel that achieves its dream and its purpose.

So with these lessons in mind I say begin the hard work of peeing yourself when you are scared to do something and do it anyway. Let the slanty-eye-making-party-boys in the front row point and stare and you march on with a full heart.  Open your curious mind to possibility, let yourself shift gears from a mountain guide to a special ed teacher, from an environmental lawyer to a self-start green entrepreneur, from a geologist PHD to a full-time father, from a law worker in Beijing to a banjo troubadour.

I’m thankful for retrospection because it brings glory and purpose to moments that really suck.  I’ve let down promoters and managers and myself when only 20 people bought tickets to a show. I’ve gotten tongue-tied and paralyzed on live radio and TV.  I‘ve broken my own heart time and again falling in love with collaborators and then losing them. I’ve compromised a home-life for a traveling life.  I’ve shed tears realizing I was going to sign that “industry-standard” contract that I knew to be unfair and inhumane. I’ve wasted time blaming others even when it really seemed like it was their fault. I have often thought I should give up the life of an artist and go back to school or get a real job not only because I’m worthless and undeserving but because my music actually really does suck. Wow, that’s some pretty wicked internal criticism, right? That’s what I like to call going super dark on yourself. I’m not sharing this because it’s inspiring or uplifting in anyway but because for me, it’s real. And I think you’ll probably have a handful of times in the coming years where you’ll feel dark and worthless, full of shame and stuck, afraid to make a move.

There is something I want so badly for you. It’s that when your 2012 graduation day photo starts to date itself as a lo-res-digital-smart-phone-prehistoric-jpeg and some human is pacing back and forth in a living room somewhere staring at your early-20’s cap’n-gown-graduation-smile and starts to wonder what’s happening to your body below the earth… the way the worms slither up to the surface through your decaying eye sockets and loam and soil push softly and ceaselessly against the wooden box cradling your skull… I want to know that you rest there below the surface assured that the short time you had on earth was not wasted on angst and disbelief, but that this open hearted, life-loving, fear-overcoming, hope-bound human is just safely folding in again to the arms of the warm grinding rhythm of eternity.

I have TWO things I hope you remember from all this, other than, of course, my stunning rendition of Whitney Houston songs and the fact that I’ve been known to pee myself:

THE FIRST THING

When you are outta here, when you are somewhere out there frantically pursuing your masters degree or your internship so completely certain of your path, OR you’re somewhere out there serving coffee all day and wondering what in the hell am I doing with my life…. Take a moment alone. Get a piece of paper and at the top write the word Obituary.  Set the timer for 5 minutes and write freely, fluidly and without judgment what it is you will have done by the time you’re really outta here.

THE SECOND THING

Methodically, repeatedly and continually cultivate your mind and heart for action. The world you create within yourself IS the world you create outside yourself. Overcome the fears inside of you. And as you learn to rise thru the darkness on the Inside, moment after moment, day after day, year after year you will see that on the Outside you are the harbinger of light, the fulfiller of dreams, the maker of World Peace.

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a-breakin’ in my soul 

Thank you.

To President Lawrence, Chairman Hill, the Board of Trustees, the faculty and staff of Sarah Lawrence College, I say thank you for inviting me to participate in this important occasion. I'm honored and humbled to be among you today. To the graduating class of 2012, I say congratulations!

To the friends, family, brothers, and sisters of graduates, and most importantly, the parents, I also offer my heartfelt congratulations. Well done everyone.

I must admit I found the process of writing this commencement address a bit daunting. I'm hoping to string together a few thoughts about what awaits you all in the wider world, when the real and unassailable truth is that nobody knows anything, and real advice is worth what you paid for it. (Well, clearly you've paid for this advice, or someone did...)

Then I came across a rhetorical flourish that I liked: I would juxtapose the moment in time when you were coming into the world, with my being formed by it.

I began looking up movies and books that came out around that time that were really important to me and to the culture around me. Movies like Blade Runner, The Shining, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Empire strikes Back, writers like Kurt Vonnegut, Harlan Ellison, Stephen King.

Then I realized that while I was thinking about the year 1980, when I was 13 and growing up a few miles away in North Tarrytown, you all weren't born until 10 year LATER, in 1990.

Then I felt old and couldn't write anything for a few days.

I started to imagine about what I, a college dropout, might have to say to a large gathering of the opposite. I thought about why I was invited to be here.

I mean, I'm still not sure what I want to be when I grow up.

This is the first question adults love to ask kids isn't it?: "What do you want to be when you grow up?" It's a lot of pressure to put on a kid. To specialize so early.

Of course Sarah Lawrence is famous as a Liberal Arts college. Both in name and in politics. But I think that there's actually a better term for the educational philosophy here. What you've gotten here is a foundational education.

A foundation. A broad base. A platform from which to launch an idea, a building, a movement, a way of thinking, generational shift.

As a generalist and a Jack-of-all-trades, I agree completely with this paradigm. The broadness of my interests gives me an excellent perspective to do what I do, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I actually spent an inordinate amount of time in my 20's thinking that I was too UNspecialized. Too old to make a splash as a young man. To be an enfant terrible.

I decried and derided all of the skills I'd serially picked up: billiards, juggling, unicycling, acting, sculpture. I never got excellent at any of them. Just good enough. What a waste of time, I thought.

But I got over that.

How? Well two things happened: One: I learned that my incessant skill-gathering gave me a distinct and unexpected benefit: The benefit of context.

When you're an expert in one thing, your lens on the world is often limited to that of your field. This is, of course, illuminating in important ways, but it can also be restricting.

When solving a problem as a generalist (or to use a more arcane term: a polymath), I can compare the many fields I've dabbled in, their techniques, their philosophies, the ways in which they alter the lens through which I see things, and I can gain a literal perspective on what I'm doing.

This turned out to be the exact reason for my success in film special effects, and eventually on MythBusters.

Steve Martin has a lovely quote in his autobiography Born Standing Up, where he recounts being told at the beginning of his career: "you will eventually use everything you've ever learned." This is entirely true.

The other thing that happened to me is that I learned how to work hard. Like bust my ass hard. There's few things that get you over your own crap more than working hard.

Wanna know how to work hard? It's not complicated. All you have to do is listen. Listen to what's going on around you. Learn how the project you're working on fits into the big picture. Learn how you fit in. Pay attention.

When you genuinely understand how the big picture works, you start being able to anticipate changes, adapt your behavior, or output. You do this and you will simply do your job better, and you'll make the job of everyone around you easier.

This is my one regret: that I didn't know until I was in my mid 20s how to truly bust my ass. People who are smart and work hard are, in fact, so hard to find that they stick out like sore thumbs. In the right way.

What else can I tell you?

You will, at some point, probably move back in with your parents. Sorry, but it's true, it's cool, and it's only temporary. Go easy on your parents. They don't know what to do with themselves now that you're gone, but that doesn't mean they want you back forever. Try and save some money while you're there.

Be kind to everyone. I can't stress this enough. I actually say it every chance I get, but it remains true. Kindness will pay back inestimable dividends. Don't believe me? I'll wager that at some point you'll have the opportunity to work for someone who used to be your assistant, or hire someone who used to be your boss. Both have happened to me. Be nice.

Don't work for fools. It's not worth it. Getting paid less to work for people you like and believe in is much better for you (and your career) in the long run.

Stay obsessed. That thing you can't stop thinking about? Keep indulging it. Obsession is the better part of success. You will be great at the things that you can't not do.

Be willing to be wrong. Don't fight for your idea just because you want the credit. Fight for your idea because it's the right one. If it's not, let it go and put your muscle behind the right one. Trust your instincts.

Seek balance.

Take yourself with a grain of salt.

Think about yourself at 17, just five some-odd years ago. Think about what you thought college would be like, and what you expected yourself to be like. Now look at yourself. I'm going to hazard a guess and say that things totally didn't turn out like you expected.

This process will repeat itself ad nauseum throughout your entire life. Everything you think now will likely be different in five years, and the more frequently you realize this, the better it will be for you. We are never finished products, we are all works in progress.

Finally:

The friends around you now? These people that saw you and fell in with you while you were still molten, being forged in the crucible of emancipation and freedom? These are some of the most intimate relationships that you will ever have. Nobody knows you like those who knew you at this age.

I'm sorry to tell you that you will hurt people that you love, and you will help people you detest. This is called being human, and it happens to everyone, whether you like it or not. Nobody escapes.

Finally, remember that you have plenty of time.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby and is one of our national treasures. A true giant of writing.

The silliest thing he ever wrote is the quote, "There are no second acts in American lives." This is insane. If there's one thing that typifies the American experience it is that reinvention and rebirth are intrinsic to it.

Raymond Chandler didn't write a single word of any consequence until his 40s. Julia Child learned to cook at 40! Clint Eastwood directed his first film at 41. Don't be afraid to be a late bloomer. Repeatedly.

Remember that you have time to figure out what you want to do. Who you need to be. Where you want to go. You have time to fail. You have time to mess up. You have time to try again. And when you mess that up, you still have time. Just so long as you're willing to work hard.

Congratulations on successfully completing Act 1.

There'll be a brief intermission, and then it's time to start enjoying Act 2.

Thank you.

Wait- sorry, sorry, sorry, stop the music, sorry

What happened there? That song is just so emot- I just met that guy! Huh... Alright, I'm just gonna have to compose myself, the show must go on here. Uh.. [Clears throat]

Students, faculty, parents, grandparents, uncles that weren't invited but showed up anyway, handsome young janitors who are secretly math geniuses and the homeless guy from With Honors, my name is Andy Samberg and I am as honored to be here today as I am unqualified.

ThereÕs a storied history of incredible Class Day speakers here at Harvard: Nobel Prize laureate Mother Teresa, former U.S. president Bill Clinton and now me, the fake rap wiener songs guy.

I'm also just over the moon to be receiving an honorary degree here today, I mean never in my wildest dreams did I- whatÕs that? No degree? So what, IÕm just like, just like a professor orÉ Oh nothing? Well, then why am I here? Dean Hammonds... (yes?) You lied to me! Alright well itÕs just this crappy speech then. I flew my folks in! Here we go.

Class of 2012, you are graduating from college that means this is the first day of the last day of your life. No, thatÕs wrong. This is the last day of the first day of school. Nope thatÕs worse. This is a day.

I too turned to WebsterÕs dictionary and it defined Harvard as Òthe season for gathering crops.Ó Admittedly thatÕs actually a definition of ÔharvestÕ but it was the closest word I could find to Harvard that wasnÕt a proper noun. In the end isnÕt that what Harvard is really about though? ItÕs about planting the seeds of knowledge that eventually produce crops, A.K.A money, in order to satisfy the farmers, your parents, who pay like 45 thousand crops a year to send you to harvest so you could major in womenÕs agriculture. You see what IÕm doing.

Before I move on, the world outside of Harvard has asked me to make a quick announcement. The following majors are apparently useless as of tomorrow: history, literature, all things related to art, social studies, East Asian studies, pretty much anything that ends with studies, romance languages, and finally, folklore and mythology. CÕmon guys. Just study something useful and play World of Warcraft in your free time ok?

Anyhow all those majors are now useless unless you can somehow turn them into an iPhone app. Math and science majors you guys are cool, finally.

2012 is a great time to be graduating from college. Sure the job market is a little slow. Sure our health care and social security systems are going to evaporate in five years. Sure you will have to work until youÕre 80 to support your 110 year old parents who live forever because of nanotechnology. Sure the concept of love will soon disappear leaving us all lonely robots ready to kill our best friend for a lukewarm cup microchip soup, but that doesnÕt matter because tomorrow you graduate from harvest- from Harvard, from Harvard is where you will graduate.

IÕm sure a lot of youÕre looking up here and thinking ÒWhat makes this guy so special? What has he accomplished? He didnÕt even go to Harvard.Ó To you I say this; I didnÕt even apply to Harvard because I knew I wouldnÕt get in. Boom! Suck on that. I donÕt accept you, esteemed college. I break up first. I move on and you see me with my hot new girlfriend. SheÕs riding shotgun in my convertible Sebring - the one that Harvard was always begging me to rent to drive up the coast. IÕm just laughing and looking really fit like, ÒHave you been going to the gym?Ó ÒNope, just eating right and making positive choices.Ó

Man, I really wanted that honorary degree! Well I guess the old saying is true: never trust Dean Hammonds.

Regardless, Harvard remains iconic in our culture. One thing that sticks out of my mind is the central role this campus played in one of the most important films ever made about social connections and how we communicate. IÕm referring of course to 1986 whimsical blackface romp, Soul Man, starring C. Thomas Howell as a white student posing as an African-American in order to exploit affirmative action. He was at Harvard law in that movie and that movie exists.

Most of you donÕt know this yet, but Harvard is one of the few schools you can attend that can also eventually become your workplace nickname. ÒWhose edamame is this in the break room? Probably HarvardÕs. Whose Vespa is in my parking spot? IÕm going with HarvardÕs.Ó In fact once a graduate you can never wear your Harvard sweatshirt in public again without looking like a world-class a-hole. I honestly think the Coop should sell University of Michigan t-shirts that you can wear just to blend in once youÕre out of here. And to clarify when I say the Coop I mean your campus bookstore, and not famous film actor Bradley Cooper, whom I also refer to as the Coop, and who also sells books and sweatshirts in his free time.

Speaking of fame, Harvard has many famous alumni: Mark Zuckerburg, Bill Gates, just a few ex-students that started successful businesses after dropping out, which means if youÕre here in this crowd today and graduating youÕre destined to be a massive failure.

Sorry those are just the facts. Also a fact, Class Day is a terrible name for a day when you donÕt have to go to class, like ever again. ItÕs pretty much like calling New YearÕs Eve ÔSobriety Night.Õ ÒHey, you going out for Sobriety Night?Ó ÒYeah itÕs gonna suckÓ.

And now on a more literary note, IÕd like to read a poem by the great W.B. Yeats, which is actually pronounced "Yeets". Lot of people donÕt know that, thanks for the heads up Barney Frank. Anyways, this is a truly beautiful and poignant passage from the 1929 collection ÔThe Winding Stair and other PoemsÕ and I think itÕs especially applicable to todayÕs ceremonies. It goes like this:

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
ItÕs Friday night and I feel alright
Hit the shore because IÕm faded
Honeys in the streets say money, yeah we made it

ThereÕs more but you get it, classic "Yeets", an important poet.

While I am really excited to be here today, IÕll be honest. At 33 years of age I havenÕt endured or lived that much more than you guys so in order to give you a broader scope of whatÕs to come, I reached out and asked for some words of wisdom from some people that I thought were relevant to your experience here.

The aforementioned Mark Zuckerberg, who was a Harvard student, was kind enough to send me some remarks that I will relay to you now.

[Imitating Zuckerberg]
Uh, hey guys, itÕs me Mark, or as my friend [?] calls me, Zuckleberry Finn. He thought of that! I just wanted to give a quick ÔcongratsÕ to you all but really more of a ÔcongratsÕ to me. You know since I left things have gone so good you guys. Like a six-year-oldÕs fantasy of the future good. In fact I recently completed the Harvard trifecta. Start your own company, have a movie be made about you and marry an Asian doctor. Trifecta! So everyone out there be sure to upgrade to timeline and lay off the PinocchioÕs pizza. Haha, I went to Harvard!

ThatÕs what he had to say. I also asked, for the local experience, Massachusetts native Mark Wahlberg to send over some thoughts for you guys. HereÕs what he had to say.

[Imitating Wahlberg]
Hey Harvard, howÕs it going? So you guys are graduating huh? I think thatÕs great. Hey we should do a film together. What do you think? You guys are super smart right? I used a prosthetic penis at boogie nights. Just think about it. Say hi to your mother for me, okay?

He asked me to say that to you guys. Then finally I asked blockbuster superstar Nick Cage for some remarks. Now, I realize he didnÕt go to Harvard and heÕs not from Boston but he has a special connection to the place that IÕll let him explain. HereÕs what he wrote.

[Imitating Nick Cage]
Good afternoon. As I write to you IÕm currently digging a tunnel into the bowels of the Widener Library. When I finally breach its mighty walls I will steal the legendary Gutenberg Bible and return it to its rightful owner, Steve Gutenberg. You know IÕve seen some weird stuff in my day. In Istanbul I saw a small child swallow a pelican whole. In the Sahara desert I saw a herd of oxen fly into a portal and disappear from our world forever. But no matter what IÕve seen thereÕs been one thing IÕve held to be true. Love is the most powerful force this universe has to offer and we should show kindness to all around us with the exception of Dean Hammonds, who is a FILTHY LIAR! And that, my friends, is the true meaning of Hanukkah. IÕd love to keep writing but now the time is come for me to ride on to my next adventure. ÓWhatÕs that?Ó you ask. Simple. IÕm going to have sex with the statue of John Harvard.

And those are my three impressions. Thank you, you guys. Late night television led me straight here. Now weÕve been paying a lot of attention to the students here today but I want to take a moment and acknowledge all the parents. In particular I want to give a shout out to all the moms in the house. Give it up. Absolutely. Absolutely. Our moms put up with so much and they ask for so little and as I look out at all the beautiful mothers here today I canÕt help but be filled with an overwhelming sense of horniness. Oh yes. YouÕre a fine crop indeed. And I likes me some older ladies, they know how to do stuff, if you know what I mean. To all the moms, open invitation, nobody gots to know about it.

Before all the dads get upset, and no disrespect, really. YouÕve got to be something special if youÕve got such fine ladies on your arms. In fact, as I look at all these strong loyal men I canÕt help but be filled with an overwhelming sense of horniness. Oh yes. I see a lot of silver foxes out there today, and Harvard isnÕt cheap. Where are my sugar daddies at? Yeah, I see you, you donÕt have to raise your hand. Open invitation gentlemen, nobody gots to know.

Now IÕd like to get a little serious. As you move forward in the world there will be obstacles but every challenge is a chance for success. You know what, IÕm sorry; I had a whole inspirational section to this prepared but now it feels so phony. So IÕm going to scrap these scripted words and just speak to you guys from the heart.

The things IÕm about to say to you arenÕt to make any friends. TheyÕre not for some cheap applause. ItÕs real talk and it comes from my soul, so listen up. Yale sucks balls! Am I right? Cheer if IÕm right! TheyÕre the worst. Yale asked me to do their Class Day speech, but I couldnÕt make it to the stage because I kept slipping in all their drool. ItÕs like a second-tier safety school in the worst city in America. IÕm kidding, New Haven is nicer nowÉthan Rwanda.

A little known fact about Yale, it was built on top of an ancient Native American toilet. Really itÕs no wonder theyÕre called the bulldogs, theyÕre a bunch of big headed inbreds with breathing problems. That comes with my apologies to any inbreds here today. DonÕt let anyone compare you to a Yalie. This all might sound harsh, but in truth Yale is basically a sewer filled with mold people, only replace the word people with stinky dried up dog turds that hate laughter and puppies. And thatÕs my heart stuff you guys, from my soul.

For some of you it might have been hard to hear but I felt it was my duty to give it to you straight. Also, quick confession, I know literally nothing about Yale. But I will say this, Dartmouth can burn in hell!
Ah, Class Day. You know itÕs hard to know where life will take you from here; what adventures youÕll have, which sitcoms youÕll write for, but my advice to you is simple. Relax dude! You just finished college at Harvard. You worked so hard. Trust me; youÕre going to kill it. I went to Santa Cruz and then I transferred to film school and IÕm rich and I donÕt mean spiritually rich or any hippie crap like that. IÕm talking about racks on racks. Believe it. IÕm being a little hyperbolic to seem cool but I am up against Mother Teresa on this thing OK? Have you guys Youtubed her Class Day speech? She was like crumping and throwing bags of money into the crowd. IÕm going to take some liberties.

But in the days ahead a lot of people will tell you to trust your instincts and donÕt be afraid to take chances, and I am definitely one of those people. But I would also say this: donÕt rush into the next phase of your life whether itÕs grad school at Harvard or grad school at MIT or massively disappointing your parents by exploring your art made out of garbage thing. Whatever it is you try, make sure itÕs what you really want to do because the only person who knows what that is, is you. If all else fails just remember these beautiful words from the film Dead PoetÕs Society:

ÒNEIL! MY NEIL IS DEAD! MY BOY!Ó

Which now that IÕve said out loud did not quite drive home my point as much as I had hoped. In fact IÕm realizing that only like seven percent of what IÕve said today has been at all helpful or even passable as English, but in the end I feel IÕm only truly qualified to give you three simple tips on how to succeed in life.
One, cut a hole in a box. Two, put your junk in said box. Three, make her or him open the box. And thatÕs the way you do it.
Also I canÕt believe IÕm about to say this, but Dean Hammonds, I forgive you. Bygones be bygones. IÕve already got that sweet degree from Santa Cruz and film school anyway.

So thank you graduates, Godspeed, and congratulations! Play the Yeets!

Good morning. What a beautiful day in Grinnell, Iowa! Congratulations, first of all, to the Class of 2007. I loved your glazed looks as you marched in. "Is this really happening?"

President Osgood, members of the faculty, trustees, families and friends of the graduates, I consider it a great honor to have been invited to address members of the class of 2007 during the concluding ritual of your residence here at Grinnell College. And I should say that although I have spoken at many commencement ceremonies, I have not yet figured out how to conquer my anxiety about the requirements of this genre of public speaking. I was just told not very long ago by one of the recipients of the honorary degree, that he just could not remember what his graduation speaker said. And no one seems to be able to remember, so I imagine this vast necropolis of commencement addresses that self-destruct immediately after they are given.

But I should say, more seriously, that as the years pass, I feel increasingly ill-equipped to assist graduates to imagine their possible futures. It is not that I think that I lack the skills that such deliberations might necessitate, but rather because of the evermore frightening instabilities of the world around us. And of course for your sake, I really wish I could give a buoyant speech replete with optimism regarding the future. I wish I could exclaim that there are worlds awaiting you and your education, and that these worlds are so arranged as to inevitably invite you to put the knowledge you have acquired here to productive use to make these worlds more habitable by human and other living beings and communities. I wish I could earnestly suggest that young humanists and scientists will with minimal effort discover exciting passageways of progress for your future trajectories. But that would be to trivialize both your education and the global and local context within which you will work and study over the coming period. And therefore, there will be no imperatives in my talk; but on second thought there may be one or two. My point is this; it seems like my ability to speak is structured by a very different grammar from that of Horace Greeley, who reputedly, I'm sure everyone knows, said to Josiah Grinnell, the founder of your institution, "Go west, young man." I suppose I might say, "Don't go to Iraq, young woman."

However, I would really like to urge you to question why you are counseled to ignore, or at best to parenthesize, that which seems not to directly affect your individual selves. And so the task I hope to accomplish is modest today. I want to help you retrieve, and sort through, and rethink, and indeed preserve memories of what may well turn out to be the most important period of your lives. And so this is my overarching question; can you now, at this time, at this age, imagine how you might articulate what will be categorized or characterized as historical memories, with what you regard as your own personal reminiscences of your college years? And there is a reason for offering you this challenge. I fear that if you don't figure out how to do this work for yourselves, it will be done for you. This is the work of ideology.

I was an undergraduate between the years 1961 and 1965 and what I remember most vividly is the Cuban Missile Crisis. I can remember the collective panic. As a matter of fact I remember friends jumping in cars and driving up to Canada, as if Canada provided some safe haven in the event of a nuclear holocaust, but at least it was a symbolic refuge. That was four decades ago. Today there is no place to run, no place to hide, and moral panics have been so carefully orchestrated, that we have come to expect that political leaders will inform us about that which merits our fear.

But before I continue, let me properly congratulate all of you who will forever be known as the Class of 2007, and 2017, and 2027, and 2037, and 2057, you will be the class of 2007. You will still be linked to each other as the Grinnell College class that graduated at this particular historic conjuncture. And so I want to ask you to look around at your classmates, and ask yourselves: how will you remember the years you shared with them? What will you say to your children or your grandchildren about these years? What will you retain from the period of your undergraduate education? Will you be able to rely on an intellectual practice capable of countering what will inevitably become a barrage of "official" recollections colonizing the most intimate alcoves of your private memory banks?

And of course history, historical memory, personal recollections are always unsettled and a bit wobbly, as they should be, but I'm asking you today to imagine what you might end up repressing and what you might end up embellishing. Will you remember how you squirmed to stay awake in what you considered to be boring classes? Or will you remember those epiphanies when things suddenly made sense and fell into place, when the anguish of writing a paper was unexpectedly transformed into sheer delight? Will you remember those moments during which much of what you previously took for granted began to crumble before your eyes, and you were struck with fear at the prospect of having to share these new insights with your parents, who, after all, played a major role in shaping the ideas that had helped you to previously interpret the world?

Will you remember that you attended a college established by a 19th Century abolitionist, who made this town, Grinnell, Iowa, a significant stop on the Underground Railroad? Will you remember that you attended a college founded by a man who unabashedly referred to himself as a radical, a man who assisted John Brown to find shelter for escaped slaves and who, even after the abolition, or should I say putative abolition of slavery, continued to fight for racial equality? Is this a legacy worth remembering? And I wonder if I'm imposing my own conjunction of historical and personal memories. Perhaps I am. For I link Josiah Grinnell to my own upbringing in the Congregationalist Church, and I remember consciously breaking the law that prohibited interracial socializing at the age of eleven, when I participated in an interracial discussion group in my Congregationalist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Before too many sessions had taken place, the church was burned by the Ku Klux Klan.

But let me return to this campus and ask, as you stroll around as you have strolled around this beautiful campus, did you ever stop to wonder about the extraordinary courage of Josiah Grinnell, who dared to associate himself with John Brown, a man who is still represented as mentally unstable? Who, after all, would devote his or her life to what, at the time, seemed like a lost cause - the abolition of slavery? Slavery as we know was legally abolished, but executive proclamations and constitutional amendments do not eliminate the ideological structures and cultural assumptions. We live today with the vestiges of slavery. How else can we explain that here, in the state of Iowa, where the population, as I understand it, is about 2.3 % black, is that right? - the population in prison is 22% black. I have never been able to think about domestic racism as a phenomenon that is separate from the drive for empire in the global south. So will you remember, and this I find absolutely amazing, that the entire four years you pursued your undergraduate studies, there was a war raging in Iraq? What if your children ask you what it was like being in school studying sociology or chemistry or philosophy or art during the Iraq war? What will you tell them when they ask you about Abu Ghraib? Twenty years in the future you're all settled with jobs and families, ensconced in your daily struggles, listening to online streams of (who knows what the technology will be then?) of oldies, and when I say oldies I mean hip-hop, right? And your children will be complaining about having to listen to that old-school stuff called hip-hop.

But I hope that you will have the courage to draw upon the education that you have received here, and also to draw from the critical skills your peers and community activists have helped you acquire in order to challenge what will undoubtedly be revisions of political legacies. I hope that you will treasure the approaches and ways of thinking that you have learned more than the facts you have accumulated. For you will never discover a scarcity of facts, and these facts will be presented in such a way as to veil the ways of thinking embedded in them. And so to reveal these hidden ways of thinking, to suggest alternate frameworks, to imagine better ways of living in evolving worlds, to imagine new human relations that are freed from persisting hierarchies, whether they be racial or sexual or geopolitical - yes, I think this is the work of educated beings. I might then ask you to think about education as the practice of freedom. Freedom then becomes, not a state for which one yearns, but rather an incessant struggle to remake our lives, our relations, our communities, and our futures.

And therefore I am concluding with a poem by the late June Jordan. It is entitled, "Poem for South African Women."

Our own shadows disappear as the feet of thousands
by the tens of thousands pound the fallow land
into new dust that
rising like a marvelous pollen will be
fertile
even as the first woman whispering
imagination to the trees around her made
for righteous fruit
from such deliberate defense of life
as no other still
will claim inferior to any other safety
in the world

The whispers too they
intimate to the inmost ear of every spirit
now aroused they
carousing in ferocious affirmation
of all peaceable and loving amplitude
sound a certainly unbounded heat
from a baptismal smoke where yes
there will be fire

And the babies cease alarm as mothers
raising arms
and heart high as the stars so far unseen
nevertheless hurl into the universe
a moving force
irreversible as light years
traveling to the open eye

And who will join this standing up
and the ones who stood without sweet company
will sing and sing
back into the mountains and
if necessary
even under the sea:

we are the ones we have been waiting for.

Congratulations to the Grinnell College Class of 2007. Thank you very much.

We had a patient at my hospital this winter whose story has stuck with me. Mrs. C was eighty-seven years old, a Holocaust survivor from Germany, and sheÕd come to the emergency room because sheÕd suddenly lost the vision in her left eye. It tells you something about her that she was at work when it happenedÑin the finance department at Sears.

SheÕd worked her entire life. When her family left Nazi Germany, they narrowly avoided the concentration camps but ended up among twenty-thousand Jewish refugees relocated to the Shanghai ghetto in Japanese-occupied China. She was a teenage girl and spent eight years there, helping her family just to live and survive, until liberation in September, 1945. Denied a formal education, she worked as a seamstress upon admission to the United States. She rose to head seamstress at Bloomingdales in Chestnut Hill, outside Boston. She married at twenty-three, had two sons, and was widowed at forty-four. She herself remained in remarkably good health.

At eighty-seven, she still lived independently in a second floor apartment in Norwood, Mass. She drove a Honda Civic. She did all her own shopping and cooking. And she still worked Ñ three and a half days a week at Sears doing office work and her other weekdays volunteering at New England Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital.

She was sitting at her desk at Sears when the vision in her left eye went completely black. It came back after three minutes. She dismissed the episode, but the next day the same thing happened again, only this time the vision didnÕt come back. Her doctor sent her to our emergency room where she was suspected to have had a stroke caused by a severe atherosclerotic blockage of the carotid artery in her neck.

She needed urgent surgery to open the blockage. She thought hard before agreeing to it. She had great fear of the risks and what they could take away from her life. But she had greater fear of what her condition might take away. Being able to remain independent, work, and contribute in some way was most important to her, and her best chance of preserving this was to act.

The operation went remarkably well. There were no problems at all. She was weak afterward but the next day, she ate, got out of bed, felt fine. The day after that, she seemed ready to leave the hospital. But she complained that constipation was making her nauseated and uncomfortable. The team tried laxatives, but they did nothing and her belly only became more painful.

A young resident was the one who, looking at her, felt that something wasnÕt right. In fact, this wasnÕt constipation at all, but a disaster from a strange complication. Her stomach had twisted on itself, pulled up into her chest, and become trappedÑa condition known as a gastric volvulus. Worse, an ulcer had formed in the lining of her stomach and seemed to have ruptured into her chest. This is catastrophic for anyone, let alone an eighty-seven year old woman. The textbooks describe an eighty percent fatality rate.

Yet she did survive. She in fact left the hospital with her son within a week. And the more I reflect on the story of how that was made possible, the more I think the story is relevant to all of us, whatever our walks of life.

When I was nearing the end of medical school, I decided to go into surgery. I had become enthralled by surgeons, especially by their competence. The source of their success, I believed, was their physical skillÑtheir hand-eye coordination and fine-motor control. But it wasnÕt, I learned in residency training. Getting the physical skills is important, and they take some time to practice and master, but they turn out to be no more difficult to learn than the ones Mrs. C mastered as a seamstress.

Instead, the critical skills the best surgeons I saw had involved the ability to handle complexity and uncertainty. They had developed judgment, mastery of teamwork, and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of their choices. In this respect, I realized, surgery turns out to be no different than a life in teaching, public service, business, or almost anything you may decide to pursue.

We all face complexity and uncertainty no matter where our path takes us. That means we all face the risk of failure. So along the way, we all are forced to develop these critical capacitiesÑof judgment, teamwork, and acceptance of responsibility.
In commencement addresses like this, people admonish us: take risks. Be willing to fail. But this has always puzzled me. Do you want a surgeon whose motto is ÒI like taking risks?Ó

We do in fact want people to take risks, to strive for difficult goals even when the possibility of failure looms. Progress cannot happen otherwise. But how they do it is what seems to matter.

The key to reducing death after surgery was the introduction of ways to reduce the risk of things going wrongÑthrough specialization, better planning, and technology. They have produced a remarkable transformation in the field. Not that long ago, surgery was so inherently dangerous, you would only consider it as a last resort. Large numbers of patients developed serious infections afterwards, bleeding, and other deadly problems we euphemistically called Òcomplications.Ó Now, surgery has become so safe and routine, most is day surgeryÑyou go home right afterwards.

But there continue to be huge differences between hospitals in the outcomes of their care. Some places still have far higher death rates than others. And an interesting line of research has opened up asking why.

Researchers at the University of Michigan discovered the answer recently, and it has a twist I didnÕt expect. I thought that the best places simply did a better job at controlling and minimizing risksÑthat they did a better job of preventing things from going wrong. But to my surprise, they didnÕt. Their complication rates after surgery were almost the same as others. Instead, what they proved to be really great at was rescuing people when they had a complication, preventing failures from becoming a catastrophe.

Scientists have given a new name to the deaths that occur in surgery after something goes wrongÑwhether it is an infection or some bizarre twist of the stomach. They call them a ÒFailure to Rescue.Ó More than anything, this is what distinguished the great from the mediocre. They didnÕt fail less. They rescued more.

This in fact may be the real story of human and societal improvement. Risk is necessary. Things can and will go wrong. But some have better capacity to prepare for the possibility, to limit the damage, and to sometimes even retrieve success from failure.

When things go wrong, there seem to be three main pitfalls to avoid, three ways to ÒFail to Rescue.Ó You could choose a wrong plan, an inadequate plan, or no plan at all. Say youÕre cooking and you inadvertently set a grease pan on fire. Throwing gasoline on the fire would be a completely wrong plan. Trying to blow the fire out would be inadequate. And ignoring itÑÒFire? What fire?ÓÑwould be no plan at all.

In the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico two years ago, all of these elements came into play, leading to the death of eleven men and the spillage of five million barrels of oil over three months. According to the official investigation, there had been early signs that the drill pipe was having problems and was improperly designed, but the companies involved did nothing. Then, on the evening of April 20, 2010, during a routine test of the well, the rig crew detected a serious abnormality in the pressure in the drill pipe. They watched it and took more measurements, which revealed a number of other abnormalities that signal a ÒkickÓÑan undetected pressure build up. But it was two hours before they recognized the seriousness of the situationÑtwo hours without a plan of action.

Then, when they did recognize the trouble, they sent the flow through a piece of equipment that canÕt handle such pressures. The kick escalated to a blowout, and the mud-gas mix exploded. At that point, emergency crews went into action. But for twelve minutes, no one sounded a general alarm to abandon the rig, leading directly to the loss of eleven lives in a second explosion.

There was, as I said, every type of error. But the key one was the delay in accepting that something serious was wrong. We see this in national policy, too. All policies court failureÑour war in Iraq, for instance. But when you refuse to even acknowledge that things arenÕt going as expected, failure can become a humanitarian disaster. The sooner youÕre able to see clearly that your best hopes and intentions have gone awry, the better. You have more room to pivot and adjust. You have more of a chance to rescue.

But recognizing that your expectations are proving wrongÑaccepting that you need a new planÑis commonly the hardest thing to do. We have this problem called confidence. To take a risk, you must have confidence in yourself. In surgery, you learn early how essential that is. You are imperfect. Your knowledge is never complete. The science is never certain. Your skills are never infallible. Yet you must act. You cannot let yourself become paralyzed by fear.

Yet you cannot blind yourself to failure, either. Indeed, you must prepare for it. For, strangely enough, only then is success possible.
When Mrs. CÕs abdominal pain turned to catastrophe, for instance, my colleagues were prepared. Now, they werenÕt prepared for anything so odd as the idea that her stomach would have wound on itself like a balloon twisted too tight. In fact, when the surgical resident told Mrs. CÕs surgeon that he was concerned about the way her abdomen felt on his exam, the surgeon thought he was being alarmist. SheÕd been doing great just the day before. And what could go wrong in someoneÕs belly after neck surgery? HeÕd never experienced seen a serious belly problem happen in this way before.

But the surgeon was humble enough to understand he could. You never really know what way trouble can strike. So he listened. He allowed the resident to order the scan he wanted to get. The team made sure it was expedited. When it showed the queer twist, no one dismissed it. They got help from another surgeon immediately. They had her on an operating table within two hours.

Nothing went exactly perfectly. There was still a good deal of fumbling around, as they tried to sort out what was really going on and what would need to be done. For a time, they hoped for a small, short procedure, using just a scope and avoiding a big operation. It would have been an inadequate planÑperhaps even the completely wrong one. But they avoided the worst mistakeÑwhich was to have no plan at all. TheyÕd acted early enough to buy themselves time for trial and error, to figure out all the steps required to get her through this calamity. They gave her and themselves the chance to rescue success from failure.

I spoke to Mrs. C a couple days ago. SheÕs living with her son now. She turned eighty-eight this past April. With her vision gone in her left eye, she cannot work anymore or drive, and she misses both greatly. ÒIÕm not the same person I used to be,Ó she told me. She doesnÕt like being dependent on others, even for just a ride. But she has otherwise returned to leading a life of her own. She enjoys her family, especially her grandchildren. SheÕs even looking for ways to volunteer again.

ÒLife is not perfect, but it is good,Ó she said.

As you embark on your path from here, you are going to take chancesÑon a relationship, a job, a new line of study. You will have great hopes. But things wonÕt always go right.

When I graduated from college, I went abroad to study philosophy. I hoped to become a philosopher, but I proved to be profoundly mediocre in the field. I tried starting a rock band. You donÕt want to know how awful the songs I wrote were. I wrote one song, for example, comparing my love for a girl to the decline of Marxism. After this, I worked in government on health care legislation that not only went nowhere, it set back the prospect of health reform almost two decades.

But the only failure is the failure to rescue something. I took away ideas and experiences and relationships with people that profoundly changed what I was able to do when I finally found the place that was for me, which was in medicine.

So you will take risks, and you will have failures. But itÕs what happens afterwards that is defining. A failure often does not have to be a failure at all. However, you have to be ready for itÑWill you admit when things go wrong? Will you take steps to set them right?Ñbecause the difference between triumph and defeat, youÕll find, isnÕt about willingness to take risks. ItÕs about mastery of rescue.

I’m honored to be with you, and especially with graduates and their families, on one of the most important days of your life.

Let me begin with some reassuring words: I won’t keep you long. At Yale, this was more than simply a matter of having mercy on a captive audience. It may interest you to know that until the 20th Century, presidents of Yale were congregational ministers. They were also physicists, philosophers, or whatever, but ordination was a condition for the job. One of their duties was to invite eminent divines to the campus to preside in the official Yale church. When visitors asked how long sermons should be, they were told: “At Yale, we believe no soul is saved after the first twenty minutes.”

In the manner of commencement speeches from time immemorial, I want to offer you a few lessons. Let’s start with the lesson in the Yale story. It is this: At least in the professional part of life, time is your most valuable asset. Like most important lessons, this is obvious. Yet it is amazing how often people forget it. This is one respect in which the religious Yale was superior to the secular Yale of today. At Yale these days, speakers seem to think that for their words to be immortal, they have to be eternal. I’m sorry to say that when I was at Yale I was a repeat offender. In my profession, we used to say, “When you’ve won your case, shut up and sit down.”

I assume you invited me here because the Foundation I lead is the nation’s leading center of research and support for entrepreneurship. But what can I possibly say about entrepreneurship that you don’t already know? The Bloch School is, after all, one of this country’s—indeed, one of the world’s—leading academic centers of entrepreneurship.

There is only one thing that I know more about than anyone here tonight. That is my life. So my plan is to tell you about a few experiences I have had that may be of use to you.

I’m not going to call these stories “lessons.” Instead, to emphasize the personal nature of what I have to say, let’s call them “Benno’s Bromides.”

You already have Bromide #1: Keep it short. Remember: the business plan for Intel fit on one page. “The Gettysburg Address” had only 272 words. Don’t be like Edward Everett, the president of Harvard, who spoke at Gettysburg for two hours. Abraham Lincoln spoke for two minutes. Guess whose talk is remembered. By the way, I’m obviously not Lincoln; I’m already at 429 words.

Benno’s Bromide #2: Make Failure Your Friend. This is the most important thing I have learned in my professional life. Edison Schools was a failure before it was a success. In December 1993, we ran out of money two weeks before Christmas, and, as CEO, I recommended to my partner that we turn out the lights. This would not have been a small failure. Every education reformer in the country had a strong opinion, for or against, about Edison. We found a way to stay alive through January. We knew the venture capital cavalry was somewhere on the other side of the mountain, but we didn’t know whether it was riding toward us or away.

We were rescued in January. I’ll never forget the first post-rescue talk I had with Janet Hickey, the pioneering venture woman from Sprout, our lead investor. Janet said, “I understand your annual run-rate is $16 million.” To which I replied, “Yes, and every penny is mission-critical.” “I understand, she said. “Take the $16 million to $4 million, and do it in a month.”

If you ever have to cut an operating budget by 75 percent in thirty days, let me assure you that you will wake up feeling—lighter.

Chris Whittle and I were once criticized by our Board for having no strategy beyond survival. Chris had a great response: “First of all, I’m not sure survival is such a bad plan.…”

Benno’s Bromide #3: Be Open to the Unexpected. Since my clerkship with Chief Justice Warren, I have never applied for a job. Put another way, every job I’ve had since I was 25 years old I either did not want or did not even think about until a few months—or even a few days—before I took it. About my current position at Kauffman, I will only say: the pattern continues.

You may think this is unusual. It is not. Ask Chancellor Morton when and why he decided to lead this great university. Ask your distinguished Dean when and why he decided to come to America. Ask Henry Bloch when and why he and his brother decided to create the world’s leading tax preparation firm. Or you could ask Tom Bloch if starting a charter school was part of his life plan.

I am not saying commitment is a bad thing. Commitment is a good thing. All bromides need to be taken in moderation—example: make failure your friend but not a habit.
Benno’s Bromide #4: Even if You Know You Are Right, You May Be Wrong.
I made a lot of mistakes when I clerked for the Chief, but he only threw me out of his office once. In the late 1960s, the court was still deciding obscenity cases—lots and lots of obscenity cases. From a constitutional point of view, these decisions were—quite literally—impossible to justify. To mention only one problem: it was impossible to define what was illegal without catching Shakespeare and virtually any great Renaissance artist in the net.

I screwed up my courage and mentioned this to the Chief. He got red in the face, then exploded: “I’ll tell you what I think,” he said. “If I caught one of those [expletive deleted] selling that [expletive deleted] to my daughter, I’d kill him with my bare hands. Now get out here and stop wasting my time.” I still cringe when I think about that moment, 45 years later.

Benno’s Bromide #5: Even if it’s Wrong, it May Be Right. When Mayor Rudy Giuliani asked me to chair a task force on The City University of New York, I knew I was in trouble. The only two things I knew about CUNY were that it was big and that it was caught in a terrible spiral of decline.

I told the Mayor that I was the worst possible person he could choose, that I had spent my whole life in private universities—Yale and Columbia—that were completely different; that critics would say I knew nothing about public universities and would be right; that everyone at CUNY would view me as nothing more than a hatchet man. “That’s why you’re the right person for this,” the Mayor grinned, “I want a fresh look.” You don’t say no to your Mayor.

Every good university is vitally important to the communities it serves. That’s why in my task force report on Kansas City, Time to Get It Right, I emphasized how many ways UMKC contributes to this city. Even so, CUNY is special. It has been “America’s equal opportunity factory,” (The Economist’s phrase, not mine) for New York’s poor and immigrant communities for over 150 years. It serves 270,000 degree-seeking students, and an equal number in “adult education” programs. Its economic impact on New York City is hard to exaggerate. For example, today, CUNY accounts for 20 percent of all construction in New York City.

If you do anything in New York you have to hold public hearings. Not even at Yale College faculty meetings have I ever been subjected to such abuse. “Ethnic cleansing” was one of the more moderate charges.

It took me a year to finish the task force report. I titled it, An Institution Adrift. I fully expected that it would sit on the shelf and collect dust. I may even secretly have hoped for that, as my confidence that I knew what was right for CUNY lessened the more I learned.

For better or worse, that was not to be. Governor Pataki and the Mayor called a press conference and announced that they were appointing Herman Badillo, the bravest person I have ever known in public life, as chairman and me as vice-chairman of the CUNY Board of Trustees. A couple of years later, when Herman ran for Mayor, I succeeded him. I’m still there. Since I first got involved in 1997:
The number of full-time faculty has increased from about 5,500 to about 7,100;
Student enrollment has gone from 200,000 to 270,000;
We serve more minority, poor and immigrant students than ever; and
Annual giving has gone from $37 million per year to over $250 million per year.

The qualitative gains CUNY has seen are even greater.

Do I deserve credit for these changes? Only a little. Prescription is easy; execution is hard. But recall what Marshall Foch said when asked if Joffre deserved credit for the victory at Gallieni: “I know who would have been blamed if we had lost.”

The greatest irony of my academic life is that I have made more of a difference in the one university that has not paid me than in the two that did. This leads me to Benno’s Bromide #6: Sometimes Your Highest Pay Isn’t Money.

The final lesson I have for you tonight has been said so many times that I cannot put my name on it. The most recent expression I have seen was in last Sunday’s New York Times Book Review. Andrew Delbanco reviewed a wonderful book by Marilynne Robinson called, When I Was a Child I Read Books. Here is Benno’s Bromide #7: Wisdom is Another Name for Humility. Go buy this book.

Congratulations, and good luck.

Ladies and gentlemen here, thank you for your very kind and warm welcome. Mr.President, Chairman Sternberg, provost director, members of the Board of Trustees, faculty, staff, parents, family members and the fabulous Northeastern graduating class of 2000! I’m so pleased to be with you on this beautiful spring morning, on this historic campus that has produced so many of America’s leaders. I thank the Board of Trustees for conferring this honorary degree upon me. I’m deeply appreciative and especially pleased to share this occasion with my distinguished fellow honorees.

I’m doubly pleased to receive the degree from Chairman Sternberg, a good friend. He’s on the advisory committee of the ColinPowell leadership center at the City College of New York, a wonderful school that we are both are graduates of.

SoI graduated in 1965 with a degree in engineering. I graduated seven years earlier as a soldier having busted out of engineering. In his success he has never forgotten the obligation he has to the schools that gave him the education that lead to that success and I offer my congratulations to Chairman Sternberg as he steps down from the chairmanship of the Board of Trustees but you are fortunate that he will continue on the board.

This is the first time I have ever been on the campus of Northeastern University and a beautiful and creative and exciting campus it is but I’m not a stranger to this neighborhood. I have to say this story from many years ago.I was a young infantry lieutenant stationed at Fort Evans, Massachusetts about 40 minutes to an hour west of here. One day a fellow lieutenant asked me to join them on a double date with some young ladies who lived in the Back Bay section, about five minutes from here, on MarlboroughStreet. He was interested in one of the ladies and he asked me to join him to run interference with the other one to get her out of the way.

I had never been on a blind date but he persuaded me to go give it a try. She was no more interested in a blind date thanI was. I was a young army lieutenant from Harlem in the South Bronx. She came from a prominent family of educators in BirminghamAlabama. She was working on a master’s degree here in Boston at Emerson College and she worked at the Boston Guild for the Hard of Hearing. She was definitely out of my league. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised as apparently was she.

We ended up dating for a number of months and then President Kennedy had an idea; let’s send Powell to Vietnam to help with the buildup of advisors to see if we can help the Vietnamese. I was to be part of that team.I was excited and anxious to go. So I drove to Marlborough Street and shared this news with the young lady. I talked about the adventure that was ahead and that this was what being a soldier was all about. She listened patiently and then she quietly said, “What about us?”

“No problem!”I said. “I’ll be back in a year.” Her eyes narrowed and she raised one of those scary eyebrows that women sometimes raise. I knew was in trouble. We were married two weeks later in Birmingham. We had a one-day honeymoon and then I moved in with her at 372 Marlborough Street for a few months before I left forVietnam, the wonderful little one roomer that was our first home. This August, I and Elma, the pretty girl from Marlborough Street will celebrate our50th wedding anniversary. So thank you Boston. Thank you,Marlborough Street.

This is not a day about me. This is a day about you. This is especially a day for your parents as with joy in their hearts they see the culmination of all those years of anxiety, love, panic and costs in this moment of achievement and success. I noticed as you were coming in you were all trying to spot where your parents and your parents are trying to spot you. So let’s stop right now, all you get up find your parents blow them a kiss and say “Thank you.I love you.”

I offer my congratulations to the faculty and staff of northeastern who imparted to the graduates their wisdom their experience and their example of service. You owe them a great deal so please applaud the faculty and staff of this fabulous school.

I remember my own graduation ceremony from the City College of New York54 years ago. I was not planning to attend the ceremony. It was a night ceremony in a dark outdoor stadium and it was a large class like this one. You didn’t get to cross the stage and have your name called out so I figured my mother wouldn’t notice that I wasn’t there. In fact I was at the Emerald Bar about a block or so away with a number of my fellow miscreants, figuring we’d have a good time and show up later. However, mothers being mothers, she sniffed the air and did not catch my scent. She knew where I was, the worst part of it. So she sent a couple of my cousins over their catch me and to drag me back to the ceremony. She had waited a long time for that moment and that was not to be denied.

As the president noted, although most folks forget such things about what the speaker said or what the president said, I still remember who the graduation speaker was 54 years ago. It was another CCYN graduate Dr.JonasSalk, the developer of the salk vaccine that defeated polio which was so terribly common in those days. I pray that 54 years from now you will remember who your graduation speaker was. The name is Powell; don’t forget it.

I’ve got to tell you, I wasn’t considered one of the great successes of the CCYN educational system. The only reason I got out of CCYN was that they included all of my R.O.T.C grades into my grade point average. I got straight A’s in R.O.T.C. and when they rolled it into there it brought me up to 2.0. They said good enough for government work, get him out of here. NowI’m considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. So those of you who are not graduating with a 3.76 like Emily Back, have faith my young friends, have faith. It’s not where you started in life. It’s where you end up and what you did along the way. Did you work hard, never stop learning? Would you believe in yourself? Where you your own role model? Did you believe in this country?Did you dream big?

It’s funny I think about this but many people come up to me now that I’ve been a Secretary of State, Joint Chief of Staff and all that, a national security adviser, “Gee, when you were a kid growing up in the South Bronx did you dream that you would grow up to be a four-star general and a Secretary of State?” I smile and answer them “Yeah there I was. I believe I was about 12 years old. I was standing on the corner of Kelley Street and 163rd and I said to myself,“Self, you are going to grow up and become a four-star general and Chief of Staff.” It doesn’t happen that way and it never will for anybody.

I worked hard. I belonged to an institution that was only concerned about your performance and your potential. The army, in those days, was the most socially progressive institution for blacks in this country while segregation was still the law of the land in so many parts of our country.It worked for me mostly because I loved doing something that was dear to my heart and that was being a soldier. I loved being a soldier and I was a good soldier because I worked hard at it. I didn’t have to become a general to find satisfaction in my career nor was that ever promised to me. I found satisfaction every day, knowing that I was trying to do my best and I was serving my country. I went into the army to be a soldier, not a general.

Some of you may also know by now what you do well and love doing and you may know what your life’s work will be. Many of you may still be unsure, still looking around and you may change your mind several times in the years ahead. Wherever you go, whatever path you follow, you have been well-prepared by the rigorous education you received here at Northeastern. As each of you look toward your future always focus on finding that which you do well and that which you love doing. Do something that gives you satisfaction every day and makes our society a better place.Do something that helps your fellow citizens.Make sure you give a good measure of your time and your talent and your treasure in service to others. The need to serve others has never been greater in our nation. Money and position will or will not follow but satisfaction will always be there. Always have a purpose in life that is beyond position and money. The marvelous and famous Northeastern co-op and service programs expose you to the non-academic world, to ground you and connect you to the real world that you will be a part of. Above all, participate in the governing in this country. Serve on local committees and boards, seat public office and seek elective office if you are so inclined.

You know we complain a lot today about politics and politicians and with good reason. We can’t sit around waiting for superman to come and save the day. We the people are then super men and super women.We are the deciders. So make yourself smart about the issues. Don’t fall for slogans and one-liners and money. Don’t fall for the hate peddlers and the cable pundit commentary. You make your own mind up. Make your decision and if you don’t like what they’re doing you vote against them and if you do like it you vote to keep them, in order bring them in, but don’t stand on the sidelines, vote. Anyone of you who is eligible to vote but is not registered come see me right after the ceremony; you’re not ready for this.

We need in our political life now the kind of consensus building that the founding fathers knew so well. I still think about them in Philadelphia in 1787 for four months and then I compare that to what our political system is like now. They sat there for four months and they all had strong views. These were men of powerful opinions but they knew they had to find compromise with each other. It’s good to fight for what you believe in but at some point you have to realize the other person may have a point and come together. So they compromise on what the House of Representatives should look like, what the power of the president is, they compromise on what the senate should look like, and what the congress should do. They compromise on one of the most difficult issues facing them at that time, slavery. They couldn’t solve it because they were there to create a nation and a constitution, not to solve this problem so it had to be put off. If these men in a hot room in Philadelphia with no press watching could do this so long ago why can’t our politicians give us a project that makes sense?It’s ridiculous.

The world you are now entering is so different and so much better than the world I started out in on my graduation. Then there were two great empires sworn to be our enemies, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. Great armies and nuclear weapons were aimed at each other. I spent 30 years being a soldier in the cold war. I stood watch on the iron curtain in Germany as a corps commander and as a lieutenant. I fought in Vietnam for two years, an extension of that conflict.I served in Korean the de-militarized zone. It finally ended for me on a day in 1988 in the Kremlin.

I was national security advisor to President Reagan and he was getting ready for his first trip ever to the evil empire. He was going to go to Moscow. He sent me toMoscow first to talk to this interesting new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev and to see more about what he was really planning to do. It was a very difficult meeting. President Gorbachev kept beating up on me and criticizing my role as a soldier for all those years and criticizing the right wing of the party that Reagan represented, thinking they didn’t understand the changes he was making. He was opening up this country. He was reforming his political economic systems and he didn’t think we understood. I just sat there watching him with passiveness on my face and he finally realized he wasn’t getting to me. He stopped, he paused, he looked up and then he had an idea and he looked back down. He stared across the table at me and was now smiling his eyes were twinkling. He gently says to me,“General, I’m so very sorry. You have to find a new enemy.” I thought to myself, I don’t want to. I have a whole career invested in this enemy, 30 years. Just because you’re having a bad year why do I have to change?He was having a bad century. Within two years of that meeting in the Kremlin the iron curtain was gone. The borderI guarded so many times, the Soviet Union was gone. Germany was unified. The Warsaw pact disappeared and Gorbachev had to step down because he was a reformer and they needed a revolution. Our system triumphed, the system of democracy, free economics, giving people the right to select their own leaders and representing themselves to the rest of the world and recognizing the need for individual human dignity triumphed and we were the leader of that crusade that helped bring us to a new place in the world.

On the other side of the world, leaders of China, 1.3 billion people, a system not like ours, they don’t respect human rights like we do, as we’ve seen in recent days but they realized that they had to change too. What they decided to do was to start making things to sell us and if we didn’t have enough money to buy the things they wanted to sell us they would then lend us the money to buy the things they wanted to sell us. As a result of that simple economic theory they have become the second largest economy in the face of the earth. I have also watched India emerge and Latin America and all parts of Asia, now slowly Africa is starting to emerge.

All of this is a triumph for the example of democracy and economic freedom that we presented to the world. It doesn’t mean that other nations need to look politically just like us but we present an example that works. Yet people often say to me we are living in the worst of times, not so. I’ve seen far worse times than this. We’re living in challenging time but more nations are free and democratic than ever before in history. There are more people living under democracy than any other time in history. Hundreds of millions of people in the last 20 years have been brought up out of poverty, out of despair, and brought into the middle class and given a better life.

The arab spring is all about jobs and economic opportunity, not fundamentalism. They have a religion. They have history and culture but what they want more than anything is an economy that works, leaders that they selected and the end of corruption so that they can start to build their economy and benefit their people. Jobs are what are driving the arab spring and the need for jobs. Ending corruption is perhaps the most difficult task for them.

While we celebrate these achievements millions more of our fellow citizens of the world are in despair, hungry, without water, education, or health care. They need and deserve our help. Those of us who have done well in this world, those of us who have used resources of the world to better our lives have an obligation to those who are not yet benefiting from the resources of the world.

The dangers are still there.Every day we read about terrorism or Iraq, Afghanistan,Iran,North Korea, Syria and other crisis areas but none of these pose the kind of threat we have faced in the past and what’s unique about the situation is that the entire international community is with us and we are with them as we try to solve these problems. They’re, for the most part, isolated without friends to take their side.

We are still looked to as the leader of the world that wants to be free. These dangerous places like I just touched on represent about six hundred million people in the world of seven billion. What are the rest doing? They’re trying to build an economy, trying to create wealth to bring people up out of despair. Economics, wealth creation, the need to create national wealth is the most powerful political force at work in the world today. China brought four hundred million people up but they still have eight hundred million people who are in despair and poverty and guess what. They can now see on television, on the internet what the others are getting and they want theirs. So that will be a major focus for china and their people will demand greater influence in who their leaders are. It is same thing throughout the world.

America’s greatest challenge therefore is for us to fix our economy. This is principally the work of the private sector, working within a sensible framework of government policies and fiscal discipline. We need to tell congress that you can’t keep spending three trillion dollars a year and only taking in a trillion dollars a year. You can’t run a Seven-Eleven like that, how are we going to run a country? It doesn’t work.

The world will need more energy of all kinds to sustain the economic growth that’s going to take place and we must find ways to use this additional energy and to generate it without devastating our environment. I’m not an expert on climate change, it just seems to me as a simple soldier that anything we can do to reduce emissions in conserving energy makes sense and we owe it to our kids to do it and being a leader of the world in achieving it.

Above all, we owe our kids the best possible education. The forward thinking nations of the world realize that their future will be determined by how well they educate their young people. That must also be our focus and a large part of my life is now spent on young people, getting them ready for education and then educating them. 15 years ago at the request of President Clinton and the other living presidents I founded the America’sPromise Alliance which is now chaired by my wife.

America’s Promise has become one of the largest youth serving alliances in the country with hundreds of partners and our major effort right now is to make America again a nation graduates. We have to create a nation of graduates, almost a third of our kids are never getting to a Northeastern because they’re not getting out of high school. They’re dropping out. 50 percent of our minority kids are dropping out. This is a catastrophe for our country and with all the wealth that we have, all the capacity we have, we can fix it and we must fix it. All of us have to play a role in fixing the situation.

We know what it takes to bring young people along. It is based on a simple set of promises that are at the heart of the America’s Promise Alliance. Every child should have in his or her life loving, caring adults. If the parents are not there to do it we need to come in with boys and girls clubs, big brothers or big sisters, all sorts of programs that surround these youngsters with a positive adult experience.That’s how you learn how to be a good child and a good adult.

Secondly, we owe our children safe places in which to learn and grow; boys and girls clubs, after-school programs, longer school days so that we protect them and give them more education which they need. The third promise is our children deserve a healthy start in life. How can we, as a first-world nation, the richest nation in the face of the earth, have six million uninsured children on our streets? It is a national tragedy and a disgrace. We ought to fix it.

We have to make sure that our children are getting educated with a marketable skill that will fit into a 21st century economy and finally something that is so well known to you but we have to bring it to every school level down to kindergarten. Give youngsters an opportunity to give back, to serve others so that virtue will grow with them as they become adults.

Governments can’t fix it. All of us have to fix it. You can’t just blame the schools and the teachers;I want to give them better salaries.I want better schools but that’s not the only problem. Education does begin in the home, not in the schools. In the first weeks of life there comes a moment when a child hears it’s mother’s voice and knows that it’s his mother. At that point the brain shuts out all other languages and only listens to the mother’s language. At that moment this child makes a bond with his mother and that’s when education begins. That’s when language begins and if the child is not read to over the next few years, doesn’t learn colors, doesn’t learn numbers, it will be behind by time it gets to the first grade and if we haven’t fix that by the third grade that kid is on the way to being a dropout or going to jail. It’s demonstrable statistically.

All of us have to get involved.I hope that that all of you, as you move through life, will reach down to help a young person stay in school and to reach their potential. So find a program that you can get involved in. You are the educated role models that kids can look up to. Be part of the solution. Make service a part of your life. Don’t go about trying to save the world; you’ll start saving the world by just saving one kid and make that a part of your life, part of your experience.

Whatever you think of the world right now, good, bad, better than it used to be, worse than it used to be, whatever you think of it, it is going to be yours to shape, yours to help bring the positive future, better future for all of our citizens of the world and America has a vital role to play.

Despite our difficulties, we are still looked to as the inspiration for reform. We’re still looked up to by the world that wants to be free. Tomorrow morning people will be lined up that every consulate office and embassy we have in the world and when they get up to the window they all say the same thing,I want to go to America. We’re still that wonderful place that my parents found some 90 years ago when they came here. We are still the best hope as long as we remain faithful to our values and as long as we keep reaching out to the rest of the world.

We’re a nation of nations. We touch every nation. Every nation touches us as long as we continue to enrich ourselves with new generations of leaders such as you. We are counting on you and so congratulations my young friends. Enjoy this beautiful day with your families.

Go forth from this place inspired by those who’ve gone before you. Go forth with the love of your families and with the blessings and pride of your teachers. Go forth and take your place, perform your duty and serve our nation. Go forth to make this into even more a perfect union. Go forth and raise strong families, remembering, as Emily pointed out, that all you can ever leave behind is your reputation, your good works and your children for the next generation. Let your dreams be your only limitations.Good luck, God bless you all.

Dr. Wong, Dr. Keough, Mrs. Novogroski, Ms. Curran, members of the board of education, family and friends of the graduates, ladies and gentlemen of the Wellesley High School class of 2012, for the privilege of speaking to you this afternoon, I am honored and grateful.  Thank you.

So here we are… commencement… life’s great forward-looking ceremony.  (And don’t say, “What about weddings?”  Weddings are one-sided and insufficiently effective.  Weddings are bride-centric pageantry.  Other than conceding to a list of unreasonable demands, the groom just stands there.  No stately, hey-everybody-look-at-me procession.  No being given away.  No identity-changing pronouncement.  And can you imagine a television show dedicated to watching guys try on tuxedos?  Their fathers sitting there misty-eyed with joy and disbelief, their brothers lurking in the corner muttering with envy.  Left to men, weddings would be, after limits-testing procrastination, spontaneous, almost inadvertent… during halftime… on the way to the refrigerator.  And then there’s the frequency of failure: statistics tell us half of you will get divorced.  A winning percentage like that’ll get you last place in the American League East.  The Baltimore Orioles do better than weddings.)

But this ceremony… commencement… a commencement works every time.  From this day forward… truly… in sickness and in health, through financial fiascos, through midlife crises and passably attractive sales reps at trade shows in Cincinnati, through diminishing tolerance for annoyingness, through every difference, irreconcilable and otherwise, you will stay forever graduated from high school, you and your diploma as one, ‘til death do you part.

No, commencement is life’s great ceremonial beginning, with its own attendant and highly appropriate symbolism.  Fitting, for example, for this auspicious rite of passage, is where we find ourselves this afternoon, the venue.  Normally, I avoid clichés like the plague, wouldn’t touch them with a ten-foot pole, but here we are on a literal level playing field.  That matters.  That says something.  And your ceremonial costume… shapeless, uniform, one-size-fits-all.  Whether male or female, tall or short, scholar or slacker, spray-tanned prom queen or intergalactic X-Box assassin, each of you is dressed, you’ll notice, exactly the same.  And your diploma… but for your name, exactly the same.

All of this is as it should be, because none of you is special.

You are not special.  You are not exceptional.

Contrary to what your u9 soccer trophy suggests, your glowing seventh grade report card, despite every assurance of a certain corpulent purple dinosaur, that nice Mister Rogers and your batty Aunt Sylvia, no matter how often your maternal caped crusader has swooped in to save you… you’re nothing special. 

Yes, you’ve been pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped.  Yes, capable adults with other things to do have held you, kissed you, fed you, wiped your mouth, wiped your bottom, trained you, taught you, tutored you, coached you, listened to you, counseled you, encouraged you, consoled you and encouraged you again.  You’ve been nudged, cajoled, wheedled and implored.  You’ve been feted and fawned over and called sweetie pie.  Yes, you have.  And, certainly, we’ve been to your games, your plays, your recitals, your science fairs.  Absolutely, smiles ignite when you walk into a room, and hundreds gasp with delight at your every tweet.  Why, maybe you’ve even had your picture in the Townsman! And now you’ve conquered high school… and, indisputably, here we all have gathered for you, the pride and joy of this fine community, the first to emerge from that magnificent new building…

But do not get the idea you’re anything special.  Because you’re not.

The empirical evidence is everywhere, numbers even an English teacher can’t ignore.  Newton, Natick, Nee… I am allowed to say Needham, yes? …that has to be two thousand high school graduates right there, give or take, and that’s just the neighborhood Ns.  Across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high schools.  That’s 37,000 valedictorians… 37,000 class presidents… 92,000 harmonizing altos… 340,000 swaggering jocks… 2,185,967 pairs of Uggs.  But why limit ourselves to high school?  After all, you’re leaving it.  So think about this: even if you’re one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you.  Imagine standing somewhere over there on Washington Street on Marathon Monday and watching sixty-eight hundred yous go running by.  And consider for a moment the bigger picture: your planet, I’ll remind you, is not the center of its solar system, your solar system is not the center of its galaxy, your galaxy is not the center of the universe.  In fact, astrophysicists assure us the universe has no center; therefore, you cannot be it.  Neither can Donald Trump… which someone should tell him… although that hair is quite a phenomenon.

“But, Dave,” you cry, “Walt Whitman tells me I’m my own version of perfection!  Epictetus tells me I have the spark of Zeus!”  And I don’t disagree.  So that makes 6.8 billion examples of perfection, 6.8 billion sparks of Zeus.  You see, if everyone is special, then no one is.  If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless.  In our unspoken but not so subtle Darwinian competition with one another–which springs, I think, from our fear of our own insignificance, a subset of our dread of mortality — we have of late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more than genuine achievement.  We have come to see them as the point — and we’re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we suspect that’s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about, something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the social totem pole.  No longer is it how you play the game, no longer is it even whether you win or lose, or learn or grow, or enjoy yourself doing it…  Now it’s “So what does this get me?”  As a consequence, we cheapen worthy endeavors, and building a Guatemalan medical clinic becomes more about the application to Bowdoin than the well-being of Guatemalans.  It’s an epidemic — and in its way, not even dear old Wellesley High is immune… one of the best of the 37,000 nationwide, Wellesley High School… where good is no longer good enough, where a B is the new C, and the midlevel curriculum is called Advanced College Placement.  And I hope you caught me when I said “one of the best.”  I said “one of the best” so we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition.  But the phrase defies logic.  By definition there can be only one best.  You’re it or you’re not.

If you’ve learned anything in your years here I hope it’s that education should be for, rather than material advantage, the exhilaration of learning.  You’ve learned, too, I hope, as Sophocles assured us, that wisdom is the chief element of happiness.  (Second is ice cream…  just an fyi)  I also hope you’ve learned enough to recognize how little you know… how little you know now… at the moment… for today is just the beginning.  It’s where you go from here that matters.

As you commence, then, and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance.  Don’t bother with work you don’t believe in any more than you would a spouse you’re not crazy about, lest you too find yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison.  Resist the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction.  Be worthy of your advantages.  And read… read all the time… read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect.  Read as a nourishing staple of life.  Develop and protect a moral sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it.  Dream big.  Work hard.  Think for yourself.  Love everything you love, everyone you love, with all your might.  And do so, please, with a sense of urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer; and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and you’ll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that eventuality no matter how delightful the afternoon.

The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life, is an achievement, not something that will fall into your lap because you’re a nice person or mommy ordered it from the caterer.  You’ll note the founding fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness–quite an active verb, “pursuit”–which leaves, I should think, little time for lying around watching parrots rollerskate on Youtube.  The first President Roosevelt, the old rough rider, advocated the strenuous life.  Mr. Thoreau wanted to drive life into a corner, to live deep and suck out all the marrow.  The poet Mary Oliver tells us to row, row into the swirl and roil.  Locally, someone… I forget who… from time to time encourages young scholars to carpe the heck out of the diem.  The point is the same: get busy, have at it.  Don’t wait for inspiration or passion to find you.  Get up, get out, explore, find it yourself, and grab hold with both hands.  (Now, before you dash off and get your YOLO tattoo, let me point out the illogic of that trendy little expression–because you can and should live not merely once, but every day of your life.  Rather than You Only Live Once, it should be You Live Only Once… but because YLOO doesn’t have the same ring, we shrug and decide it doesn’t matter.)

None of this day-seizing, though, this YLOOing, should be interpreted as license for self-indulgence.  Like accolades ought to be, the fulfilled life is a consequence, a gratifying byproduct.  It’s what happens when you’re thinking about more important things.  Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view.  Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.  Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your list and congratulate yourself for being worldly.  Exercise free will and creative, independent thought not for the satisfactions they will bring you, but for the good they will do others, the rest of the 6.8 billion–and those who will follow them.  And then you too will discover the great and curious truth of the human experience is that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself.  The sweetest joys of life, then, come only with the recognition that you’re not special.

Because everyone is.

Congratulations.  Good luck.  Make for yourselves, please, for your sake and for ours, extraordinary lives.

Thank you, President Monaco, Chairman Stern, faculty and staff, friends and family and the graduates of the Class of 2012. It is a pleasure to be here with all of you today.

So, as many of you know, I am a fan of Tufts, and when it was announced that I was going to be joining you as a commencement speaker, a friend of mine sent me the editorial from the April 2nd edition of the Tufts Daily. It was titled, “A Fine Choice for Commencement Speaker.” I thought that was great, and then I read further. “Eric Robert Greitens might be the greatest commencement speaker that you’ve never heard of.”  

Now, I know that at a moment like this, one of the things that has happened in the country over the course of the past year is that Navy SEALs have become really popular, especially after the raid against Osama Bin Laden and the recent hostage rescue of Jessica Buchanan in Somalia. And recently there was a small newspaper in Spokane, Wash., that asked me if I would come out and do an interview, to talk a little bit about the character of Navy SEALs. So I spoke to the reporter for a bit, then I woke up the next morning and I was pleased to read at the bottom of the newspaper there was a small headline that read “Navy SEAL Says Role Requires Humility as Well as Strength.” I thought that was great; I thought they did a nice job on the headline. I was pretty excited. Then I noticed that that story was right underneath a story of a wild pig that had been shot dead in the street. And that headline read, “Ham on the Lam Dies With a Bam.” So let that be a lesson that no matter what you do in your life, it will always be tough to beat those stories of wild pigs running loose in the streets.

But I am honored that all of you would ask me to be here with you today. I have never had the opportunity to give a commencement before this year – and I initially felt unqualified. And then I remembered I have spoken to people who were on the precipice of life changing moments; moments of severe consequences and even potential disaster. I have spoken to refugees in danger of starvation. I have talked to United States Marines as they had to face down death in Iraq. I have talked to Navy SEALs who faced the prospect of being severely wounded in Afghanistan. And now I add to that list you, the graduates of the class of 2012, who face the very real danger of going home to live in your parents’ basements.

Now, a graduation is a celebration, and it also is a passage. And it’s a time to reflect. It’s a time to make important choices. So in an effort to help you, I went back and looked at some sources of ancient wisdom. I didn’t look at Plato’s dialogues, or the Bible or the Declaration of Independence. Instead, I went back to look at one of the most profound sources of insight I’ve ever known, which were the “Choose Your Own Adventure” stories that I read as a kid. Now, one of my favorites, “Journey Under the Sea,” began, and it said, “Beware and warning, this book is different from other books. You and you alone are in charge of what happens in this story. There are dangers, choices, adventures and consequences. This is your most challenging and dangerous mission. Fear and excitement are now your companions.”

“Fear and excitement are now your companions.” It kind of sounds like a college graduation, right? There’s a tremendous amount of excitement, but it is also natural for there to be some fear. Because you are all leaving one phase of your life and are about to step out into a new frontline to face a new set of challenges and hardships and fears and opportunities. A time has now come for all of you to choose your own adventure. As you go forward, you may find that there are lessons that you learned here at Tufts that will help you along the way.

For me, college was an important time. I grew up in Missouri, and before I had been to college, I had never been outside of the country before, and I had never really been very far outside of Missouri. But when I was in college, I had a professor who asked me for the first time to go with him to do international humanitarian work. It was the summer of 1994, at the time there was a brutal civil war that had broken out a few years earlier in the former Yugoslavia, and it was a war that was marked by horrific bouts of ethnic cleansing. I went to live and to work in refugee camps with survivors of the ethnic cleansing. And I was working with people who had lost every material possession they’d ever owned. I was working with many people who had lost friends and family, and I remember when I went, I was thinking to myself that if I had lost everything they had and that I were in the refugee camp, that I would be very concerned about myself and my own pain and my own hardship and my own difficulty.

But what I found in the camp was that oftentimes, the people who were doing the best were oftentimes the parents and grandparents who had really young kids. Because they knew that even in that incredibly difficult situation, they knew that they had to wake up every single day to be strong for someone else. The people who I saw who were often struggling the most were the people who were my age at the time, many of them were the age that many of you are now; they were the young adults and the older teenagers who felt like their life had been cut short, but they didn’t yet feel like anyone was counting on them. They didn’t yet feel like anyone needed them to be strong. I saw the same thing later when I worked in Rwanda with survivors of the genocide, and in Cambodia when I worked with kids who had lost limbs to landmines. In every case, those who knew that they had a purpose that was larger than themselves, those who knew that others were counting on them, they grew to be stronger.

College should have been for you a time to think about yourself, to explore the world, to focus on your interest, to hone your abilities, to test your ideas. As you step into the world it is right and fair for you to have questions and concerns about your future. What kind of job will you find? What kind of friends will you make? Where will you live? Those concerns are right and fair. What I also learned in college is that the more you ask the question “What kind of service can I provide? What kind of positive difference can I make in the lives of others;” if you work everyday to live an answer to that question, then you will be stronger.

In my own journey I also came to believe there were times when people with strength needed to use that strength to protect others. And that led me to serve in the United States military. When I joined the military, I went to BUD/S. BUD/S stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training. It is often considered to be the hardest military training in the world. And in that training, they ask you to do a lot of difficult things. So, they ask you to swim 50 meters underwater. Later, they ask you to swim down 50 feet and tie a knot. There is an evolution called drown-proofing, and what they do is they tie your feet together and they tie your hands behind your back and you have to jump in the pool. And with your feet tied together and your hands tied behind your back, you then have to swim 50 meters. They ask you to do physical training on the beach with logs that weigh several hundred pounds.

And there is one thing that they love to have people do. They love to have people do these firemen-carry drills. And what happens in a fireman-carry drill is that you grab somebody and you have to throw them over your shoulder and then you run with them down the beach through soft sand. You grab somebody and you throw them over your shoulder and you have to run with them through a path, through the mountains. And there actually comes one test in the training where everybody’s wearing a 40-pound rucksack, carrying a rifle, and you have to do a 10-mile run. But the trick is that over the course of that 10-mile run, every step of the way, at least one person is injured and has to be carried. Now are there any thoughts about what it takes to do something like that successfully? Ma’am, do you have any thoughts? You guys thought I wasn’t going to call on you! It’s commencement, you still get called on. Absolutely, teamwork, for sure. Any other thoughts? For sure, it takes a tremendous amount of determination to do it.

Well, I will tell you what I learned and this is important to know, if you ever have to do this, or if you ever know anybody who ever has to do this or anything like this. What I learned that was absolutely essential, what you wanted to do at the very beginning, at the very beginning of something like that, you wanted to position yourself so that you are standing next to the lightest guy. And that made a tremendous difference over the course of the 10-mile run.

But the pinnacle of all of that training, it comes in a week that is often consider the hardest week, of the hardest military training in the world and that week is called “Hell Week.” Over the course of Hell Week, the average class sleeps for a total of two to five hours over the course of the whole week. They have you doing four mile timed runs on the beach, two mile ocean swims, running the obstacle course. It’s a week of constant change and challenge and chaos and confusion. And I can remember my hardest moment in Hell Week.

My hardest moment came at what should have been one of the easiest moments in that week. It came at the time that we were first all of us allowed to actually run into the tents to go to sleep. Now what the instructors did was they had everybody go outside to these parallel bars and do a dip contest to see which crew was going to be allowed to run into the tents first. My crew lost, so I was the last person to run into the tents.

We had been awake at that point for over 72 hours, and by the time I ran into the tents everyone was passed out asleep. I laid down on my cot and I could not fall asleep. With every beat of my heart I could feel my right foot pumping. So I got up and I took my boot off and there was a bandage that had been wrapped around my foot. I ripped the bandage off, threw it on the ground, tied my boot back on, laid back down and I still couldn’t go to sleep. And what happened then was that fear started to run through my mind, and I started to think, what is going to happen if I can’t sleep? We only get two to five hours of sleep over the whole week. What is going to happen to me if I can’t sleep? And I knew that I was actually going a little crazy because the thought actually ran through my mind, I actually thought to myself, well, maybe if they can’t sleep maybe they’ll let me have a nap later.

And so I couldn’t sleep, and then we’re in this tent, it’s an Army general purpose tent, and in the top of the tent there is a small cut out and there is a beam of sunlight that is coming down on my cot and the cots of a bunch of the people around me. And after it’d been oppressively cold all week, it’s now incredibly hot in the tent. And what happened then was I started to feel sorry for myself. And I started to think, you know, it’s not fair that I ran into the tents last; it’s not fair that I got the worst cot; it’s not fair that they wrapped my foot the wrong way the last time I went through medical; it’s not fair, it’s not fair. And I started to feel all of this self-pity for myself, and all of this fear, and that was my hardest moment.

I was really worried about what was going to happen. And I just got up then and I walked outside of the tent, and I walked over to a facet. It was about shoulder height, and I turned it on and I put my head underneath and I just washed some water over my head, and as I turned back to the tents, I just said to myself, I said, “It’s not about me.” I said, “This test isn’t about me. This test is about my ability to be of service to the people who are asleep in that tent right now.” And the minute that I stopped focusing on myself, all of that fear, and all of that self-pity and all of that worry washed away, and I walked into the tent and I laid down and I went to sleep.

I found that what was true for the refugees in Bosnia was true in my own life and my own hardest moment; that the more I thought about myself, the weaker I became. The more I recognized that I was serving a purpose larger than myself, the stronger I became. Having learned that lesson in college, having lived it in the SEAL teams, today, I try to share that lesson and the work we do at The Mission Continues.

The work we do today began on March 28, 2007, when many of you who are graduating today, I think at the time were probably juniors in high school. At the time I was serving as the commander of an al-Qaeda targeting cell in Fallujah, Iraq. As the commander of an al-Qaeda targeting cell, my unit’s mission was to capture mid- to senior-level al-Qaeda leaders in and around the Fallujah area.

On March 28, 2007, my team was hit by a suicide truck bomb. I was fine. I was taken to the Fallujah surgical hospital and I was able to return to duty 72 hours later. But some of the people who were in the barracks with me, some of whom were just an arm’s length from me, ended up being hurt far worse than I was. And when I came home to visit them, I went to see them and I also went to Bethesda, to the naval hospital, to visit with some recently returned wounded Marines.

You walk into one of those hospital rooms and you’re talking to men and women who are your age. They are your friends, they are your colleagues, they are certainly your brothers and sisters, if not in blood then in spirit, and they are part of your generation. When I asked each one of them who was in the hospital what they wanted to do when they recovered, every single one of them said to me. “I want to return to my unit.” Now the reality was, for many of the men and women who I was visiting that day, that they were not going to be able to return to their unit. One of them had lost both of his legs. The other lost the use of his right arm, part of his right lung. Another lost a good part of his hearing.

So I asked each one of them, well, if you can’t return to your unit right away, tell me what else you’d like to do. And every single one of them told me that they wanted to find a way to continue to serve. They didn’t necessarily use the word “service;” one of them said service; one of them said, “You know I had kind of a rough childhood growing up, and I’d like to find a way to go home and maybe be a mentor and a football coach.” Another one told me, he said, “You know what, my dad and I were talking and I think I might try and find a way to go back to college and become a teacher.” Another one told me he was thinking about going home to get involved within law enforcement. What became clear to me that day, was that I was just one of a long string of visitors coming in to see all these men and women to say thank you. And they appreciated that. They appreciated when people came in to say thank you. But what they also had to hear in addition to thank you was, they had to hear “we still need you.” They had to know that when we looked at them we saw them as assets and that we were willing to challenge them to find a way to continue to be of service.

Today at The Mission Continues, we have over 350 veterans who are now gone from being citizen warriors to citizen leaders in their community. They work at Habitat for Humanity and Big Brothers Big Sisters and the American Red Cross. One of our fellows Roman Baca had worked for eight years as a machine gunner in the United States Marine Corps, he is also an incredibly talented ballet artist. When he came home from Iraq, The Mission Continues gave him a fellowship to set up a ballet and dance program in the New York City public schools. Within 72 hours of setting up that program he had students from 15 schools sign up for his program, and Roman recently took his students back to Iraq on a cultural exchange program, where they did dance with other Iraqi students.

Our fellows have overcome lose of eyesight, loss of limbs, severe burns, post traumatic stress, and yet they have come home to continue to serve in our communities. And they are outstanding citizen leaders. I know from working with them, what you and your generation are capable of. And I know that from you, from all of you having been here at Tufts, having drawn from this idea of active citizenship, that what I want to say to you is the same thing that I said to them, and what I say to you is that “We still need you.”

The best definition I have ever heard of a vocation is that it’s the place where your great joy meets the world’s great need. For you to build that vocation will take both compassion and courage. There are infinite possibilities for you for joy, for service, to make a contribution, and we need all of you to find your vocation. To develop your joys, your passions, and to match them to the world’s great needs.

It is traditional for commencement speakers to come and give advice. I have very little advice to give you. Instead, I would like to ask something of you. Let’s decide that today will be both a day of celebration and a day that we embrace a challenge. Let’s look back with pride at all that you have accomplished, and let’s also look forward with confidence, knowing that you will go forward to use all of your talents and abilities, all of your creativity and energy to find a way to be of service to others. If you do that, life will not be easy, but you will have chosen for yourself a very meaningful adventure.

It is a bright path ahead for all of you, and it’s a great honor for me to share this day with you. Congratulations Tufts Class of 2012.

Thank you.

Whenever somebody says such nice things about me, I think of a certain school teacher I heard about. On the first day of every school term, she always sent a note home with each student in the class. The note read –

“Dear Parent, if you promise not to believe everything your child says happens at school, I promise not to believe everything he says happens at home.” Of course I want you to believe everything the commissioner just said about me. Thank you.

President Pilarz, members of the Board of Trustees, members of the faculty, staff and student body, members of the distinguished graduating Class of 2012, parents, family members and friends of the Classes, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your kind invitation to share this occasion with you. I should tell you that I was far more comfortable standing at home plate at old county stadium waiting for a fast ball than I am at this moment standing behind this podium to deliver the commencement address at Marquette University. I must say this is a bit out of character for me but I am honored by your invitation.

I have known of Marquette since my early days in baseball. In fact, I passed your campus many times walking to County stadium in 1954, my rookie year with the Milwaukee Braves. I had no car, so I walked the three or so miles from the Strater Hotel to the ballpark. I was very much in awe of what I saw of Marquette then, and I must say, I still am. In fact, you have been interwoven in the wonderful memories that I have of Milwaukee and the people of Wisconsin.

A little town called Eau Clair and the city of Milwaukee helped to shape my dreams and my life and helped to mold me into the man I am today. I can never forget that here I found acceptance, encouragement, self-confidence and lifelong friends. At the invitation of one of those friends, Mr. Allan “Bud” Selig, I returned here to play out my career with the Milwaukee Brewers after breaking Babe Ruth’s record. I concluded my 23 years in baseball, hitting my last homerun, number 755, at county stadium in 1976. Today, I return to Milwaukee to celebrate with you the realization of your dream to earn your degree from Marquette University.

Let me first congratulate you for staying the course. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt once said that “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. So my message to you today comes from the words of the poet Langston Hughes and I quote,“Hold fast to dreams, for when dreams die life is like a broken wing bird that cannot fly.” Today I want to challenge you to hold fast to your dreams, for I believe that our hopes and dreams are a motivating factor in our desire to climb the highest mountain.

The Spring season of the year is the perfect time for the rebirth of dreams. Like nature itself, Spring gives us new hope and a new beginning. In baseball, Spring training represents a new season of hope and anticipation of a new opportunity to win a championship. Likewise, Spring commencements provide new opportunities for you to continue to climb the ladder of success. Your years of hard work and study here at

Marquette are cause for celebration. The goal of our lives is to develop our full potential and realize our dreams. For most of us the realization of our dream requires a strong unyielding commitment, hard work and determination.

The 1921 Nobel Prize winner in Literature, Anatole France, put it this way, “To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream, not only plan, but also believe.” My late friend, Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, educator and President of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, often said and I quote, “The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn’t a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream.” Dr. Mays went on to say that “It is not a disgrace to not reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not failure, but low aim is sin.” Unquote.

From the time I was a young kid in Mobile, Alabama, I dreamed of playing baseball in the major leagues. Being a black kid, of course, that was an impossible dream. It was not until Jackie Robinson broke the color line that I began thinking that maybe if I worked hard enough, I could realize my dream of playing in the Major Leagues. Breaking into the big leagues in the days of segregation was extremely hard. There were many times when I wanted to give up but I kept going and I learned that if you want something bad enough, you have to make the necessary sacrifices to get it. You learn to navigate the circumstances and accept the fact that failure is not an option for you.

I had to believe in myself and my ability to compete. During both the season and the off season, I worked hard at staying focused, staying healthy and keeping my body fit. I set goals at the beginning of each season and each time I achieved one goal it gave me the confidence to reach for a higher goal. I learned to be patient when I got in a slump. I learned to wait for my pitch before swinging the bat.

The temptations that exist today to take short cuts to success were not around in my days. So I can’t say how valid my response is to the often asked questions about steroids. I’d like to think that I would have rejected any kind of drugs that did not meet the approval of the team doctor. I talk to a lot of kids today who dream of playing baseball. What I say to all of them is simple, to stay away from substances that will harm your body. Be patient and work hard to develop your skills. There is no substitute for excuses, hard work and determination.

There are absolutely no acceptable shortcuts to success in life. Cheating for whatever reason and in any field is wrong and is at best a temporary solution to a greater problem. At some point, quick fixes will come back to haunt you and might destroy your body and your dreams.

Great or small, your accomplishments thus far will follow you for years to come. For what you do with your life and how you do it is not only a reflection on you, but on your family and all of those institutions that have helped to make you who you are. My mother used to say to me when I was a boy “Don’t forget you are my son. Don’t bring no shame to this family.” By the look on her face when she said it, I knew she meant it, and I knew what the consequences would be if I misbehaved.

When I retired from baseball in 1976, I had accomplished everything that I set out to accomplish. I felt good about myself and my accomplishments but my reflexes had slowed, my eyesight was dimming and my body was signaling, every time I went to the plate, that it was time to quit, and so I did.

My success in baseball helped me realize my responsibility to give back to my community. To that end, my wife Billie and I founded the Hank Aaron Chasing the Dream Foundation in 1994. With the help of my friends, Bud Selig and Joe Kennedy, and many others of course, we have provided scholarship assistance to some 850 kids and young adults to help them chase their dreams.

Thanks to the Milwaukee Brewers, we have for the past 10 years continued to provide assistance to 23 or so “dream chasers” in the Boys and Girls Clubs here in Milwaukee. Three years ago with the generous assistance of Commissioner Bud Selig, we started a new program in partnership with the National Boys and Girls Clubs called “44 Forever.” This program will allow us to assist 44 kids a year between the ages of 12 and 17 in perpetuity.

Through this program of giving back to our community, we are living our dream. You are among the fortunate few to have been educated by some of the best minds in higher education. You must now pass on to future generations life’s lessons learned here. Our country is in great need of your talent and your services. In good times and in bad times, you will be expected to make the best of the educational opportunities that you have been given.

So, I challenge you to hold fast to your dreams and always remember, as one writer has said “each of us has something unique to offer the world, if only we have the courage to dream and the determination to make our dreams come true.”

Congratulations to you all and may God bless each and every one of you!

Although I oppose the idea of the Commencement address, I have been thinking about what would have been useful for me to hear on the day I left college. I wish that someone had said to me that it's normal to feel lost for a little while. You know, you get out of school, and you have this great and very expensive education, and you are a rocket ready to launch. It is not clear where you should be pointed, or even how to get off the ground. And what are you supposed to exactly do to make this big incredible life that now you're supposedly trained to create? You're supposed to be like, 'Alright, let's go!' But what do you do?

I, I think, was as ambitious as any of you in this class. I was working at a network news show All Things Considered at the age of 20. And even I floundered. I floundered badly. I had one skill as a person in my 20's, and that is that. For whatever reason, I was a good editor; I was a very decent editor from the start. But for all the other things that make me decent at my job now-how to make a story, how to structure a story, how to find a story, how to report-I was a terrible, terrible writer. I was the kind of writer who writes a paragraph and then looks at it and thinks, 'Oh no, now I'm going to move all the words around' and then rewrites it over and over again.

I spent years in my 20's doing mediocre stories that should have taken days but, in fact, took me months. I spent years wondering if I should just learn to become a journalist by going to journalism school, by going to grad school. Instead-and this is just a little practical tip I simply decided...-I simply would take NPR reporters and pay them $50 to look at scripts I was working on, which was much cheaper than grad school.

As a performer on the air, I was a complete stiff; and I want to say that this is not some sort of weird, false modesty. Like, I was bad- there is proof of this on the Internet. Google, and you'll see it. I made very little money: My personal financial goal was 'your age times a thousand,' which I did not achieve until I was in my 30's. For many years I made from $12,000 to $18,000. I have to say that it was very sobering for me to read in The New York Times last week (they had this series on college debt) that people get out of college with $900 a month in student loans that they have to pay. That was my entire income some years.

My parents, throughout my 20's when I was working in public radio, they completely opposed everything that I was doing working in public broadcasting. Somehow, my parents are the only Jews in America who do not listen to public radio. They thought I should be a doctor. I was a premed student, among other things. Their idea for my life was to have some kids and live here in the Baltimore suburbs where I grew up, like their parents' kids. I hope this is not embarrassing to say this: I had my own national radio show; I had been on David Letterman; there had been a New York Times magazine article about me before they stopped suggesting medical school was still an option.

And to their great credit, they changed. I think one of the most difficult things for a parent is to readjust what their kids should be with what their kids want to be. And I think when you're the kid in that situation, it's really easy to be glib and just want your parents to catch up to who you're turning yourself into. And in my case, my parents, they were worried about money. My parents both grew up in really, really poor households, really financially insecure. They saw that I was making no money, and it just pushed all of their buttons, and they were really, really worried. When I was in my 20's, things were said between us that ... .

My mom passed away a few years ago of cancer, and there are things I said in my 20's-I mean we made up well before then- but there are things I said to her, and to both my parents, in my 20's that I still regret as we fought over what I was doing. I would just say to you guys, as your parents catch up to you, like I think my parents caught up to me with as much grace as anybody could... don't be a dick.

There's a show on HBO that I admire a lot called Girls. It's about what it's like in the years after college when you're trying to make a life for yourself. It's about what you guys are about to launch yourselves into. Every single fact about that show is completely different from my life when I was in my 20's, but the essence of that show feels exactly the same. What's great about that show is that it's a completely unromantic view of what your life is about to be. The young women on that show, they flounder, they pretend to know what they're doing when they absolutely don't. They strongly believe things that are transparently untrue. I myself spent years- YEARS- in a terrible kind of politically correct phase where I travelled to Nicaragua and called it 'Niquragua' to observe the Sandinista revolution firsthand.

You will be stupid. You will worry your parents as I worried mine. You will question your own choices. You will question your relationships, your jobs, your friends, where you live, what you studied in college-that you went to college at all-and the thing I want to say is: That is totally OK. That is totally normal. If that happens, you're doing it right.

You know, when you're in school, you're on a path, and there are signposts, and there are goals. They give you grades, which, in retrospect, is an insanely wonderful thing that people are constantly grading you and telling you, 'You did well! You did badly! You did well!' Now you are going to join the confusing mess of life with me and your parents and the rest of us, that we've been living in for years ahead of you, where it is not clear at all how to evaluate anything that you are doing or how you're going to spend the rest of this time on this earth. Welcome to your future.

And the good news is that you can will things into existence. Like, I was not a very good writer, and I just willed it to happen by trying and trying and trying. You leave this school as well-armed for battle as anyone is. You're doing as well as anybody. And, in my case, you just have to make up what you're going to be. I would just work and work and work and make up little series that I'll produce on Morning Edition, and ... I just assumed that ideas would be sprinkled on me like fairy dust: You wake up, and you have a good idea. I had to learn that ideas, if you were going to make creative work, you have to find an idea to make the work about. That is a job in itself. And where do ideas come from? They come from other ideas, and you have to surround yourself with things that are interesting to you and notice what is exciting to you and what you want to dive into, and finding what you're going to make your short story or film or song or art project or movie about is a job.  Finding what you want to do next is a job. It's a task: You have to set aside hours in the day, and you have to be a soldier, and you have to fight for what you're going to make in yourself.

You cannot tell yourself where things would lead. My Grandma Frieda, after she got out of Goucher, her life took some really, really rough turns. She graduated in 1931 during a slight economic turndown you might have heard of. She divorced soon after having two children. She was a single mom during the Depression and afterward. Back when she was a teenager here in Baltimore, to treat her acne (she had bad acne), they had this brand-new, amazing technology called X-rays, that they would expose your skin to in high doses to clear up your skin. Only later did they realize that high doses of radiation like that would give you skin cancer, which kicked in when she was 32. They had to remove all the skin from her face and graft on skin from elsewhere on her body, which took over 40 separate operations. She was the first one on either side of my family to have gone to college but ended up taking over the family business, which is a little corner grocery down on Bayard Street downtown-basically a Jewish bodega- that the family lived upstairs from, where my dad and my uncle also worked.

She talked about Goucher so fondly as she got older because, I think, she was happy here. It was a really happy time in her life. My dad and my uncle both told me this week that after Goucher, things got a lot harder for her. Eventually, she did the job she trained for at Goucher, which was to be a teacher.

In her files here at Goucher there are evaluations from classes that she took. There's one dated April 1931:

"Miss Freelander gives promise of being a very successful teacher. She has a sense of social responsibility, a pleasing personality, an excellent and well-trained mind. Her teaching practice met 'great success, making unusual, varied, interesting, well-organized lesson plans, presenting her material with force and vigor, quenching her points in a most experienced manner.'"

Eventually, she taught French in the public high schools here in Baltimore, in the city, at a high school confusingly enough called City College. Apparently, she was very good at it-a writer named Dwayne Wickham wrote a memoir about growing up in Baltimore and struggling in school and nearly dropping out, and he names her as one of the few teachers who tried to rescue him as he struggled through high school -just as her teachers at Goucher predicted.  

I'm going to close with a story that seems crazy, but I remember telling this story, and my dad insists it's true. It's about the day that Grandma Frieda, Goucher grad, Bawlmer girl, met Adolf Hitler. She was married in June 1932, and there was enough money from the corner store at that point to honeymoon in Europe, in Germany. She and my grandfather, Louie, were getting a tour of some government building. I was always told that it was the Reichstag building, which burned down a year later, and they were led through a room- you know you get in with a group of tourists and are led through these various rooms. They walk into a room, and the tour guide says, "Oh, this is Herr Hitler, you know, who's trying to become our new chancellor." My Grandma Frieda would describe him as this short, little man- unimpressive little man- and he nods at the foreign tourists, and they kinda nod at him and move on to the next room. Years later, my Grandma used to say, in her high school classroom at City College she would tell this story, and the response was always the same from the students. They would always say the same thing. They would raise their hands and go, 'Why didn't you kill him?'

And she said, "Well, if I'd have KNOWN what he was going to DO! It was 1932!"

And right there is the problem. We don't know. We lurch forward in our lives: We try this; we try that; we make the best guesses that we can, based on what we believe at the time, and it is entirely possible that a Goucher grad-that you, or you, or you-will get the chance to change the world and kill Adolf Hitler, and you will miss it. And that is entirely possible.

But I have to say, I talked to a lot of you last night, and I have to say, I believe in you. I think that it is just as likely that you will continue to grow and build muscle, which is your next task, and continue to make yourselves into who it is you are trying to be. And when you get your chance to remake the world, when you get the chance to change everything for yourself, and hopefully for others, too, when you get your chance to shoot Adolf Hitler, you will know what to do.

That's my wish for you on this day.

I feel so important!

Thank you so much, President Christ, the Board of Trustees, distinguished alumnae, my fellow honorary degree recipients, parents and friends, and of course, all of you, the Smith College Class of 2012!

You are about to receive a piece of paper that proves to the world you are now fit to join the ranks of an elite and tremendously powerful group of game-changing women. Smith women have transformed cuisine, spearheaded social movements, created great literature and, in the case of my friend Piper, class of ’92, even gone to prison! But damnit — when a Smithie goes to prison — she writes a clever and compelling book about it!

Just know, the fact that you sit here in a chair assigned to you, with your bright, shiny faces, looking gorgeous in caps and gowns, you’ve actually done far more than I was able to accomplish on my college graduation day back in 1982.

As a young person I was a victim of overwhelming angst and free-floating anxiety. I spent a great deal of my time running around like a chicken with its head cut off. This ongoing frenzy caused me to send in my graduation registration without a stamp or return address.

After my four mostly unfocused years as a solid “C” student at Illinois State University, in the aptly named Normal, Illinois, I sat where you now sit, hoping to God my name would be called and I would receive a diploma. I realized my postal booboo just as the envelope left my hand and dropped into the mailbox. Instead of figuring out a way to remedy this, I did what I have always done when I lack forethought and impulse control; I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.

With my entire family out there in the audience, wearing a cap and gown I swiped when no one was looking, sharing a chair with my friend Jeannie Mahoney, I held my breath and prayed to hear my name. They finished with the L’s, and were on to the M’s, when my heart sank. As Jeannie took her diploma from our dean, she whispered in his ear that my name had been left out. Gratefully, he called mine after hers. He didn’t have a diploma for me but he did shake my hand. My parents, sitting way in the back, were none the wiser.

I know that none of you would have been so scattered and unfocused leading up to this day because you are the Smith Class of 2012. You are exceptional women, and if you were not you would not be here. I feel I know quite a bit about Smith women, because I married one of you. I know from living with Lara class of ’91, and loving Lara class of ’91, that the experience of attending this fabulous college is transformative. Your lives will take different paths, but you will always be Smithies.

You are the women of Smith. You are fiercely independent, wicked smart, trail blazing, uber confident and shockingly entitled. Like I told you, I live with one of you. I have no doubt you will continue with this legacy and you will change the world. And, we need you to, women of Smith College — now more than ever.

But in this moment, young ladies and Ada Comstocks, on this most auspicious of days, I want you to take a breath and reflect. Don’t blow through this day, even if you are overwhelmed with family or just a little bit drunk. Take a breath. You have successfully completed a journey at an exceptional institution of learning and attention must be paid.

If I could do so much of my early life over, I would have taken more moments like this to breathe. I would have spent more time focusing on what was right in front of me, instead of recoiling from what is because it didn’t look or feel exactly as I imagined it. I wouldn’t have been forever trying to look around the corner to see “What’s next, what’s next?!”

I’d have taken in the beauty of the moment, and greeted everything in my life with a big “YES, AND.” Which leads me to what I want to talk to you about today. And today is all about you. But just a little bit about me.

I was born a red-faced screaming malcontent with sparkling blue eyes and chubby cheeks. Along with this extra helping of angst, I felt alien in the world and in my own body, as I was sure I should have been a boy.

I spent most of my youth deeply disappointed so much of the time, because nothing ever looked or felt the way I imagined it should. I wanted to ride my bike with my shirt off all summer. I wanted to play little league baseball — I did not want to wear a dress or curl my hair. I was only happy with a clear blue sky, and I lived in Illinois where winter lasts until May and spring usually skips us altogether. If the day loomed cloudy, and it usually did, my poor mother would fear my lashing out at the weather for having let me down. I took everything so personally.

I lived my life this way for about 27 years, until my life stepped in with a huge lesson that I was just aware enough to notice.

At the time I fancied myself a serious actress; sketch comedy was not on my radar. Out of left field, I was hired for The Second City. For those of you who don’t know, The Second City is a Chicago institution, and the improvisational breeding ground where Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Nia Vardolos along with some guys you might recognize, got their start.

There I was, a tightly wound young woman obsessed with process, rules, fresh out of grad school, I was a classically trained pain in the ass, frankly, engaging in improvisation: the creative equivalent of jumping off a cliff. An art where there are no rules, save one; it’s called “YES, AND.”

“YES AND” is the vital and only rule of improvisation. Never deny your fellow actor. You should be willing and able to accept whatever your fellow improviser throws at you. Use that as your jumping off point and expand it. “Heighten and explore,” as we call it.

For instance, if I say to you “Stick ’em up!” and you say “That’s not a gun, that’s your finger!” We’ve got nowhere to go.

If I say “What a beautiful day” and you say, “No it’s not, it’s the middle of winter and it’s snowing!” Where do we go?

Or I say “Come my darling, it’s time for bed.” And you say, “You’re not my wife and put your pants back on!” Now what do I do with that? The scene is dead in the water and I’m literally caught with my pants down.

In order for our scene to go forward, we affirm what the other is saying, which is the “YES” part of our equation, and take it and build, the “AND” part of our equation.

In other words, in order for our lives to go forward, in order to engage fully in life, we need to be willing and able to accept what is right in front of us. Whatever it is, the good, the bad, the thrilling, the heartbreaking, every emotion, occurrence, event, person, place or thing, you will experience them all. That’s the “YES” I’m talking about. And the acceptance and embrace of it with all your heart and doing something with it, that’s the “AND.” You accept influence and then you exert influence. You can’t make a cloudy day a sunny day, but can embrace it and decide it’s going to be a good day after all.

I learn through contrast. I had one of my first significant experiences of “NO, BUT” when I was a freshman in high school. I auditioned for and was cast as the king in a one-act version of the “Princess and the Pea” story called The Ugly Duckling (beginning a life-long pattern of playing roles originally intended for men). I’d known I wanted to be an actress right out of the chute and I was beside myself with excitement.

At the audition, I got huge laughs. At the first rehearsal, I didn’t get the big laughs, I didn’t get the love and I quit. I was devastated and so confused. I had no idea what I had done! My 14-year-old self had no idea how to process it. I had walked up to that which I had ached to do for as long as could remember, and I don’t think I go too far when I say, I came face to face with my destiny, and I walked away. Ya know why? Because it didn’t feel like I imagined it should have felt. I didn’t get the response, i.e. the big laugh, i.e. the big love like I expected. There was now a real possibility of failure and I quit. I was at this time unaware of the concept of “YES AND.” Feeling the fear and doing it anyway.

As you travel through life, in these many years ahead, I guarantee that you will come upon countless times in which the last thing you’re gonna want to say is “YES AND.” You will experience loss, heartache, the death of a loved one, you’ll probably have to say goodbye to a lover, you’ll experience rejection, maybe have to deal with a bad diagnosis. You’ll age.

The trick isn’t to avoid these times or pretend they’re not happening; you can’t. What you’ll need to do is step up to them courageously and embrace them. Allow these experiences to permeate your being and weave them all into the fabric of your life. They will not only soften you and strengthen you, and you will open your heart to compassion. You will not be powerless in this. If you embrace what is happening, instead of denying it, you can make it your own. If life gives you lemons, grab it by the horns and drive. Yes I just mixed three metaphors, remember I was a “C” student.

As a younger person full of anxiety and fear, in desperate pursuit of keys to the kingdom, let me tell you what I did right. After I’d walked away from The Ugly Duckling my freshman year in high school, I would never let fear take me over again (at least in the acting department). Not that I would never feel fear again, I would just plow through it. I grabbed at almost every opportunity, maybe even some I should have left by the wayside.

This is not to suggest you should say “YES AND” to every opportunity presented to you.

Now, I know what you’re thinking, “Jane, what about doing porno?” To which I say I am as surprised as you are that I was never offered that opportunity.

But would I have said yes to that? What if life gives us the opportunity to rob a bank, or a way to cheat on our taxes, or say it offers us several hours in a row of life with the Kardashians...hours that we can never get back?

To this I say: you can always trust that when you’re coming from your highest self and from your heart, you’ll know when you should say “YES AND,” and when to engage the awesome power of “NO WAY.”

Now, this “YES AND” way of life may not be the most natural thing to do for you Smith College Class of 2012 women sitting in front of me today. You’re highly educated. You are so schooled in critical thinking it almost hurts to look at you. The point of your education is to get you to poke holes in theories, to question, to be loath to accept anything at face value. “YES AND” may not roll trippingly off your tongue, and into your life.

Your job is to honestly discern for yourself if you’re saying “no” to an opportunity out of fear, or are you simply exercising good judgment.

For me, the hardest thing to get past was my need to plan. I thought I had to have a plan or a strategy to get where I wanted to go. From my earliest moments, I knew I wanted to be an actress. I had a driving, anxiety-filled ambition. Growing up in this concrete jungle of a suburb just south of Chicago, I had no idea how I would get there. “Just show me the road map or a manual. Or please, someone drop down from the heavens, take my hand and show me the way.” I was ripe for a cult.

I took to rules, regulations and parameters in an effort to feel safe. While I waited for that clear plan of action, I would have at least an illusion of certainty in what has always felt to me to be an unsafe, unpredictable and ever-changing world.

It turns out I just had to be willing to take chances, look at what’s right in front of me and greet everything with a big “YES AND,” putting all of my heart into everything I do. My counsel to you, women of Smith College? Let life surprise you. Don’t have a plan. Plans are for wusses. If my life went according to my plan, I would never ever have the life I have today.

You are obviously good planners, or you wouldn’t be here. Stop it! Stop it now! Don’t deprive yourself of the exciting journey your life can be when you relinquish the need to have goals and a blueprint.

I guess I am assuming you all are as terrified as I was of life, so you know that when you feel sick to your stomach, it’s a good thing! It signals “Opportunity For Big Growth Ahead!” “Somethin’s coming, somethin’ good.” Don’t ignore the nausea. Step up to it.

At one point, I’d had a lean financial year, and performing “It’s a Hard Knock Life” from Annie in my pantyhose had lost its charm. I was stuck creatively and professionally, I was in my late 30s, terrified that the parade was passing me by. The thought of writing a show by myself and for myself began to bubble up to the surface of my consciousness, making me very sick to my stomach.

So with a big “YES AND” and chutzpah I didn’t even know I had, I created something where there had once been nothing for the very first time in my life.

On my own nickel, I rented a theater for eight consecutive Wednesday nights, wrote monologues for characters I had accessed from the deepest recesses of my psyche, and I created a one-hour romp (which I performed literally stinking of fear, at moments terrified and others, elated).

I was never more proud of myself, and it blew wide open the doors of my self-confidence. I emerged, in my humble opinion, an artist and a changed woman. I was now one poised for, and deserving of, the next level. I met Christopher Guest shortly thereafter and was cast in Best in Show. I was 40 years old, and I was finally in the game. I could never have planned this.

Other momentous occasions where my dreams were about to come true, and yet I wanted nothing more than to flee the scene:

Being offered the opportunity to host the Emmys.

Being asked to host “Saturday Night Live.”

Being asked to give the Commencement speech at Smith College.

When my insides screamed “NO!!” I somehow got my mouth to say “YES AND.”

Life is not all about work — and the scariest places to say “Yes And” are also the most rewarding...in a relationship.

Whoever you choose, your husband, wife or partner, will make you see more about yourself than any navel gazing in solitude could ever reveal.

And if the process isn’t completely horrifying and frustrating, then you’re not doing it right. This will be your most vulnerable place.

I put it off until I was almost 50. Your partner will inevitably see your soft underbelly. Shocking behavior you only read about will start to become your own. Your demon will rise up to righteously destroy your relationship in the guise of saving yourself from really seeing yourself. Your partner will say to you with all the tenderness that situation allows, “What the fuck?” You’ll want to break up with yourself.

Don’t be afraid of this horrible version of you! Face it, embrace it, coddle it, write it a poem, maybe it needs a hug. Shine the light of day on it. Unclaimed and unacknowledged, it’s got the power and its darkest forces will have you enslaved! Accept its influence, mine it for its gold. Yep, sometimes saying “YES AND” is going to take everything you’ve got. But the payoff, trusting in love, is just incredible.

The day after I met my wife, I met my daughter. I don’t really like kids; I’m a dog person. But you couldn’t have designed a better kid for me. She’s witty, wise beyond her years, she has a huge heart, and such patience with the frailties of human nature. I don’t mean to make her sound like the Dalai Lama, but she is exceptional. One day you will meet your child; you may give birth to her, adopt her, she may just wander over or follow you home. We do “meet” them because they are born who they are. We don’t make them, we welcome them. Nothing like knowing they are watching you will make you want to be your best self. Haden was 7 when I met her, she’s now 10 and in eight more years we hope to be dropping her off right here.

Children also remind us that life is constantly changing and moving ever forward. It’s true. It doth not stop. I really came to know this as I turned 40 years old. I’m just a late bloomer, folks. The big 4-0 was much anticipated. I resolved to have a party for myself and actually mark it, celebrate it. Say “YES AND” to it. So I turned 40 years old one day. And you know what happened? I turned 41. THEN, I turned 42! And it just kept on going, just like that, the number kept going up! Wait! Wait! Somebody press the pause button! I just got used to being 40! And it goes even faster as you get older. And the world keeps changing. My advice to you; live in the moment. Stay fluid and roll with those changes. Life is just a big extended improvisation. Embrace the ever changing, ever evolving world with the best rule I’ve ever found. Say “YES AND.”

Accept the world for what it is, and at the same time, make it your own. I especially want you to make it your own. You are a particular variety of person, Ms. Smithie. You have spent the last four years in an environment that has encouraged you to be not just yourself, but your best self, your strongest self.

You will have many opportunities to embrace what the world has for you. I can’t wait to see the ways in which you say “AND.” Remember that Smith Woman entitlement I spoke of earlier? I’m counting on yours to ferociously guard the women’s health care rights our sisters won for us years ago. I know you women of Smith will greet that fight with a big “YES AND,” and any one who tries take them away from you with a huge “NO WAY.”

In conclusion, I know you’ll never forget your experience here and that you are a part of an incredible legacy. I’ll be at a party with my wife, and she’ll be meeting one person after another and if she by chance happens upon a fellow Smithie, both of their eyes will light up. They already share a profound connection; they’ve both had a unique and extraordinary experience. Today I become a Smithie! That same piece of paper that my wife and all of you toiled for years to get, I now get for handshake. I am so proud to be one of you.

Enjoy this day and thank you so much.

Michelle Obama could not be here this morning. My name is Jefferson Smith and class of 2012, friends, family and faculty, I am an Oregon duck. It is said that history has time for but one sentence for anyone. What will your sentence be?

I sat through this ceremony before this beautiful arena had been built alongside thousands of classmates and our families. We asked ourselves essentially the same question. What will we be when we grow up?

When I was in preschool we were going around the class and talking about what we wanted to be when we grew up. We were going around and people were saying police officer, firefighter, and Real estate mobile. It came to my friend who I remember because he was the other tallest kid in the class. He said, “I want to be a fire engine.” I being a busy body in the class said,“You can’t be a fire engine.” He said, “My mom told me I could be anything I want.” We all looked around the room; our moms had told us pretty much the same thing.

It is not entirely true that you can be anything you want but it’s not as much of a lie as you might think. The world is pretty open. They say history has time for about one sentence for any of us.

GeorgeWashington was the father of our country. Harriet Tubman led the Underground Railroad. The generation of earlier last century, they called that the greatest generation. What will your sentence be?

I know I’m supposed to come up here and tell you that many opportunities come for you and I’ll say something about that but I want to say something else. You might be screwed. I don’t know why you’re clapping; you’ve misunderstood the meaning of that word.

Not just you, not just University of Oregon graduates, in some important respects your whole generation is getting screwed. You’re projected to be the first generation of face lower lifetime earnings than your parents. Many of you’re looking for jobs in what economists say over the past five or six years has been the toughest job market since the Great Depression. Your generation faces the greatest wealth disparity since before World War II. There are real questions about whether the systems of our democracy are in the position to solve our biggest problems and address the public interest. Other generations have had it hard and you’ve had advantages. You haven’t had to face a draft. You’ve got a cool phone; it’s like star trek. Actually it’s way better than star trek because they don’t have Angry Birds.

The point here isn’t to spark comparison about whether you faced relatively more blessings or relatively more challenges than others. The point here is that it is up to you to deal with those challenges. I want to offer some thoughts and questions about coming to grips with that. That includes rethinking some of our fundamental assumptions. This commencement is not a pity party.

I am here to call you to service. First, how do we define success? Do we measure it materially or externally by our houses or cars, our consumer electronics, the distance of our vacations, or more from within, in core purpose? An over-reliance on certain measures of success can mess up a person. It can mess up a country. It can encourage folks to ring up unsustainable debt so that life looks good to the neighbors. It can encourage banks to depart from a mission of smart capital access and to over define their mission is strictly the pursuit of profit.

Even if greed were good, greed it is not enough. Barry Diller led Paramount when he supervised both Michael Eisner, who became head of Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who became the ‘K’ in DreamWorksSKG. He helped transform paramount and modern movie industry. Big opening weekends were called blockbusters because the line outside the movie theatre would bust the block. Miller told the young Katzenberg “I never want you to fight for a project because you think it might have a market. I only want you to fight for a project because you believe in it.”

I thought about that, why would Barry Diller say this? He is not some non-profiteer, some political advocate; this was Barry Diller trying to make money for paramount. It occurred to me,I suppose we work harder for something if we believe in it. It also occurred to make the perhaps were bad guessers. Even armed with polls and focus group information we can’t be entirely sure what will please other people. A much better guide is our own internal compass.

WhenI pass along that adviceI do it also because maybe that fighting for things we believe in is one of them ost important purposes of our lives. We often visualize success as a ladder.WhenI sat where you are sitting I certainly did.

Early on, I graduated class president, voted most likely to succeed. After my father, who would’ve taken care of me and my mother passed from cancer, I was fortunate to be able to get an in-state tuition and great education at

the University of Oregon

I wanted to go to law school and I got into the best one I could, Harvard. I graduated pretty near the top my class and got a job with the highest paying law firm I could find in Manhattan because it was the highest paying law firm I could find. More and more of their work was becoming big tobacco defense. My mother had passed from cancer.

On one of my first Sunday evenings in New York, I didn’t know my way around andI walked to a nearby McDonald’s. The place was filled with families in their Sunday best having come from the church around the corner. I was standing in line next to a family, an African-American man and Latino wife and two small children. The kids were asking their dad for happy meals. The dad said no you can have cheeseburgers and the kids did what I would have done.That’s their mother, and she turned to her husband and she said can’t they just have happy meals? He looked at her and he wasn’t angry; he was scared and he said they could.

Here I was, 27 years old, projected to make a quarter million dollars that year and next to me was a family obviously working, going to church, doing the right thing, arguing about whether they could afford happy meals for Sunday dinner in the richest countries in the history of the world.

My ladder had gone off its rails a bit after that. I realized I wasn’t cut out to represent big tobacco or eventually be a corporate lawyer. We show off and have a vision of success as a ladder to climb. But there is no ladder, and it has no top and eventually we have to decide what we want to do, what we want to be, what we want to stand for, and eventually we die.

None of us reach much success alone and we need not define success limited to what we do by ourselves. I attended a thank you party for politicians ran for office in 2010 and lost. I was asked to say something at what amounted to a political wake and I said, “None of us in this room will be GeorgeWashington. None of us will beGandhi. If we define our success by the station that we reach we can’t winbut if we define success by the movements in which we participate, in what we stand for and what we work towards we can’t lose.

When invited to do a talk like this we’re supposed to give advice, this assumes that I know more than I do but here’s what I think. My advice for how we might get unscrewed is work hard, define success more meaningfully, work together, you can’t do anything you want but you can do more than you think. Find what you care about, what you can do, what you can get good at, and do that. Don’t just think about what already exists. Think about what doesn’t and do that. Don’t just choose between your creative brain and your logical brain. The future belongs to those who can use their whole brain. Don’t just be tools of machines or raging against machines but build new machines. Consider not only have a serve yourself but how to serve. We need you.

After taking so many tests over the past several years you have some more important questions to answer going forward. What are you going to do? If it takes 10,000 hours to get really good at something, what is worth your 10,000hours? What will be success for you? Not just what you can get but what can you accomplish? How might you find things that are worth fighting for? What can we create, not just by and for ourselves but together? How can you and how will you help get us unscrewed? Can you be the next greatest generation?

When historians are writing about the twenty first century what will they write about and what will they write about you? History has time for a sentence. What will your sentence be?

Thank you President Barren, distinguished members of the faculty and staff of Florida State and the members of the graduating class of 2012. In case any of you didn’t know it I suffered a stroke a couple years ago. I’ve had a lot of therapy and it has helped but I might have trouble speaking at times so please bear with me. Congratulations to the class of 2012.

I was fortunate enough to be where you are 55 years ago. Here at Florida StateI was famous for one thing. I was Burt Reynolds’ roommate. Everybody says “So what?”The guy was so good looking I used to send him out for bait. He’d go over to the Student Union and bring back two girls, one was beautiful and one was ugly. I got the ugly one but I found out real quick that Burt Reynolds’ ugly girlfriends were better than anything I could get on my own.

I have ten minutes to tell you something of importance that I’ve learned in 55 years. So here it goes. First are relationships. Yes, in life there will be relationships. No matter what business you go into or job you have, personal relationships is the key. Remember; be very very careful not to be so involved in social networks that you lose sight of the face-to-face relationships with people. That is the key, face-to-face relationships.

There’s a Chinese story about a cookie jar. The Chinese put the Grandfather in a big room and they put the children around him. The children asked him one question. They said, “Grandfather, what is the secret to a good, solid relationship?” Grandfather said, “Relationships are like a cookie jar. If you take a cookie from the cookie jar and don’t put a cookie back in the cookie jar, you’ll lead to an empty cookie jar and an empty relationship.”

Greed will kill you. In this life I’ve learned that if you’re greedy you’re destined to fail. In the business world, leave a little on the table. Don’t be greedy. In your personal relationships, don’t be greedy. Remember this because in the future you’ll find that every broken relationship you have in this life you’ll find out that somebody took the cookies out of you jar. You’ll end up with an empty cookie jar and an empty relationship.

What have I learned about the character of people? The true test of a human being’s character is how he treats people in his life that he doesn’t use. The true test of a human being’s character is how he treats people in life he cannot use.

You’ll get into the business world; everybody treats the presidents and the vice presidents with respect and dignity but how do you treat the secretary, the guy who parks your car, or the little lady that pours water into the plants? How do you treat those people?That’s the true test of the character of a human being.

In coaching everybody treats the first team great but you are judged in my mind in how you treat the people that don’t play. How you treat those guys who don’t play is a secret and I’ll tell you one thing I’ve learned, through all these years, that people will watch you and they will judge you on one single fact.

How do you treat people in your life you cannot use? Remember that because that’s a big one.

Then I learned that you’ll have to build a program or a team someday. What have I learned about building a team?Surround yourself with good people. You win with character, not characters and there is a hell of a difference is that ‘s.’

When things are going well, everything is perfect, it’s alright, but when bad things happen characters will all point the finger and never pull their thumb. There’s a hell of a difference in that finger and that thumb because, I promise you, when bad things happen characters will come out and get you. Not only that characters will get you beat, they’ll get you fired because they’ll all point their finger and nobody pulls a thumb.

In any organization you never get rid of a good, loyal, hard-working, dedicated human being. They’re hard to find. Like in football, if you put them in tackle and he can’t block the end, so you move him to guard. He can’t block the guys in the middle so you put him at center. He can’t block the guys in center so what do you do? You take him to all those banquets with you and introduce him, “That’s my football player.” because let me tell you something you can’t find enough good, hardworking, loyal human beings to associate yourself with and when you find one keep him.

When I was a coach in Indiana I had a test. I’d bring in all of the prospects and I’d put all of them in the front row of a basketball game and I’d watch them when the national anthem is played. I had three kids there and they wouldn’t get up. They wouldn’t stand up. They wouldn’t even stand up for our national anthem and they would not take their hats off. I said to the assistant coach, “You see those three guys?” He said “Yes.” I said “I want them out of here.” He said, “They can run they’re going to help us win…” I said “I want them out of here by half time. If they can’t respect our country, how do figure that they will respect our team?”

They cannot be a good football player. I never saw those guys again until the next year. We opened the season with them and they were on the other team. One was throwing, the other one catching, and the other tackling. They beat the crap out of me. Those three guys beat the crap out of my football team. I was devastated. I said “It’ll be alright. We’ll get them next year in Bloomington.” The same thing happened! Those three guys, running and throwing and kicking, they beat the crap out of me the second year over. I was devastated.

Three weeks later, one was caught for rape, one was caught for assault and one was caught for robbery. They kicked them off that football team and let me tell you something, my friend was a good coach, and he was coaching that team, a young guy and they kicked him off the coaching. That coach never coached another game in his life. You know why? He prostituted his integrity, to win a few lousy football games, by getting those kids on his football team.

Let me tell you, you never prostitute your integrity to get a job or to keep one. I was head coach for 15 years. I never had an NCAA investigator ever talk to one of my players, not once in 15 years. I’m proud of that.

The most important lesson I’m going to leave you with is as follows. I was 47 years old. I was the head coach in Indiana. I had three and a half years left in my contract. I beat Perdue twice in a row which is like beating Florida twice in a row. I had material things.I had everything a man could want. I was the luckiest guy in the world. I got my first break in my life; Indiana fired me. I found out about it in the newspaper. It hurt but I’ll tell you one thing, it killed my family. It hurt my family a lot. Not because they fired me but the way they did. Well, let me tell you something, I learned that 95 percent of the true friends that you have in this life live under the same roof as you do.

When it got down to it my family was all I had left and you can’t do enough for your family. When you think you’ve done enough, do more! You can’t do enough. Your family is most important. I’ve been fortunate. I’ve had a lot of things in my life. I have one plaque that sits on my desk. It says “25 years of coaching with honesty and integrity.” You know who gave me that? My family. It’s the only thing of importance.

Never prostitute your integrity to get a job or to keep one and maybe someday you can get a plaque from your family. Remember, our greatest glory consists not and never following but rising every time you fall.

Class of 2012, good luck and thank you.

President Higdon, trustees, faculty, Class of 2012, ladies and gentlemen.

Congratulations Class of 2012 – and congratulations to your proud families.

It is a great yet humbling privilege to not only share this momentous day with you but to receive this honorary doctorate.

President Higdon and I first knew each other more than 30 years ago. I’m not sure that back then Lee ever imagined he would be President of one of America’s finest liberal arts colleges. Nor could I have dreamed that one day I would be United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James.

This honorary doctorate is a distinction I welcome with a measure of humility since I’m aware that it puts me in rarefied company.

So many eminent people have stood here before me looking out on this glorious view of Long Island Sound.

People such as Joyce Carol Oates, Wangari Maathai, John Kenneth Galbraith, Marian Wright Edelman and Arthur Schlesinger.

But the one claim I can make - and to the best of my knowledge they cannot - is that this is my second Connecticut College commencement.

The first was back in 1984.

I sat exactly where your parents are sitting now as I watched our daughter Sally cross the stage to collect her degree.

I know from personal experience how they are feeling: enormously sentimental but desperate not to embarrass you by crying – especially the dads.

Gentlemen, if it helps in any way … I cried. Your parents’ emotions are a mix of pride and apprehension. Pride at watching their little girl or boy grow up to be a college graduate. Apprehension at what the future holds for you.

So let me try to put to rest some of their anxieties about your prospects. Because I have seen firsthand the enduring value of the Connecticut College experience. You, the Class of 2012, has had the privilege of one of the best educations in the country. You have been challenged – and encouraged – to look at problems and solutions from the perspectives of many different disciplines.

Looking at a list of senior theses and projects, I am impressed to see topics like the challenge of sustainable agriculture, the role of women in economic development, the prevention of human trafficking and the legacy of Franco’s Spain for human rights today. Rather than simply teaching you to answer questions, Connecticut has also taught you to ask them.

It’s exactly the sort of approach that the world needs today. And keep in mind that some of your greatest lessons will have often taken place outside the classroom.

Connecticut’s not only given you a first class education; it’s aroused your curiosity, opened your eyes to the world and awakened you to life’s possibilities.

You are now fully prepared to begin living out your hopes and aspirations.

And with all the immense challenges we face, the necessity for you to do so right away is more important than ever.

We need your ideas and your idealism. Your energy and your enthusiasm. Your passion and your optimism.

Now is the time for you to find your voice and to understand your place in the world.

One day, you will be leaders in businesses, law, the arts, education, government, or whatever path you choose.

But through social media and networking sites you are already involved in the world to a degree that my generation was notA world where issues like the economy, security, climate change and poverty affect us all – wherever we live, whatever our faith; whether we are rich or poor, learned or uneducated, old or young.

No longer are we immune or can we isolate ourselves from events elsewhere around the world. The banking crisis of 2008 taught us that what happens in the financial sector of one country, affects the economies of every country.

Likewise, the painful lesson of global terrorism is that it does not respect boundaries of morality or geography.

We know that pollution from a coal-fired power station in Asia alters the weather in Europe; and that toxic waste dumped in the sea off South America kills marine life off the coast of Australia. And if we don’t help the world’s poorest, then we do not just fail morally, we will also pay the price in increased terrorism, crime, mass migration and environmental devastation.

Our complex and interrelated world means, therefore, that we all share an interest in overcoming the global challenges that face us. And no one has a greater stake in the outcome than you do. So you have an important part to play.

Everywhere, your generation is already accepting responsibilities far beyond anyone’s expectations.

No example of that is greater than the events we have witnessed in the Arab Spring where young people, with incredible courage and dignity, are challenging the status quo. Now, of course, I am not recommending that you overthrow the government. Nor am I suggesting that changing the world is easy; or that you don’t have anxieties as individuals that are a little closer to home.

You are graduating at a time of great uncertainty. Everything may seem unsettled, unclear, and even intimidating.

Faith in many of the old certainties of the past is being tested.

Basic things like, ‘Will I get a good job?” ‘Will I be able to afford a home?’ ‘Will I do better than my parents?’

I’m sure these thoughts are on the minds of some of you today.But whatever you decide to do, you will have opportunities to make your voice heard.

Opportunities to question traditional ways of thinking and to challenge long-held conventions.

Opportunities to make your mark.

That is the unique promise of the United States.

Each of us has the potential to aspire to greatness.

This is not a country where individuals are born with title, rank or royalty.

Instead, we emerge into life carrying only our personal dreams and desires.

And we allow ourselves to claim pursuit of those dreams as a cherished and fundamental right.

Your challenge is to begin building a future that is worthy of your dreams, a future worthy of your parents and this college, a future worthy of the values of America.

Half a century ago, in his famous inaugural speech, President Kennedy declared that the “torch has been passed to a new generation”.

I believe we are now at a similar moment.

And nothing inspires my generation more than knowing that young people like you are ready to receive the torch.

For as globalization and modern technology make the world increasingly inter-connected, you simply cannot be bystanders.

I encourage you to engage fully with your world. See the challenges faced by the international community as your challenges.

It is up to you to decide how you will make your contributions, but do not wait to make a difference.

Help the world find its way ahead.

As you do, two small pieces of advice: always protect your reputation – and have the courage to follow your dreams.

It’s your future, I am sure you’ll make the most of it.

Thank you. And good luck.

Good morning, Annenberg graduates and congratulations! You’ve made it through one of the most prestigious universities in the world. You are accomplished and, yes, you are blessed.Blessed to be stepping out into the world with your degrees in journalism, PR, and Communication, right at the moment when it seems like everything in the world is about communication.

We’re communicating like never before, across borders and time zones, on platforms, devices, computers, tablets, phones, apps, games, you name it.Communicating 24/7, wired and wirelessly, talking, texting, and tweeting, trending and friending, to the other side of the room and the other side of the planet, spitting out the old, in order to consume the new.

Every minute you’re awake, you’re reaching out beyond yourself, way out beyond. It feels like the entire universe is an extension of your own nervous system.You communicate instantly, automatically, and effortlessly. For you communicating is like breathing.

And today, you’re raring to go, raring to go out into the “real” world, to get a job and transform the world of communication yet again. It’s a race to be next, to be first, and to be new. Sort of scary, isn’t it.

I get that because when I close my eyes, it feels like just yesterday that I sat where you are, and I remember exactly how I felt.

My boyfriend had hidden a bottle of champagne under his graduation robe for the celebration afterwards but me? I was anxious, and I was scared.I had applied for a job in TV news, but I hadn’t heard back. And I remember everybody was asking me, “What are you going to do after graduation? Do you have a job? What’s your job?” and I felt so bad about myself, because I didn’t have the answer.

I graduated in May, and for months I was asked “What are you going to do? What are you going to do?” which got me beating the living daylights out of myself, all the way until I landed a job in October.

Back then, I didn’t realize that that question, the “What-are-you-going to-do?” question dogs us all our lives.

When you get that assignment desk job in local TV, everyone asks you, “When are you going on The Air?” And then it’s “When are you going to the Network?”After you meet that special someone, people ask you, “When are you going to get married?” Then right away, it’s “When are you going to have a kid?” After that, “When are you going to have the next one?”

I remember when I wrote my first book, people would come up to me at book-signings and ask when the next book was coming out.Right in the middle of the Women’s Conferences I produced, people would ask me, “Who are you going to get to speak next year?”Even today at my age, people come up to me all the time asking, ‘Maria, What are you doing? What’s your job? Are you going back into television? Are you writing another book? Are you going to run another women’s conference? What are you doing?’

It’s like what we’re doing at this precise moment doesn’t even exist. Everyone is focused on the next thing. Everyone is racing to the Next Thing.Well, I got caught up in that for a really long time, so much so, that I could never really enjoy what I was doing, because I was always worried about what I was going to be doing.

I tell you all this, because I know right now everybody’s asking you those same questions: “What are you going to do after graduation? Do you have a job? Where will you be working? How much are they paying? Where are you going? Where will you be living? Who are you seeing?” Oh, my God, so many questions!

And here you are, sitting there ready to hit the fast forward button and find out the answers. I get that. I was just like you. I lived on fast forward.But today, I have one wish for you. Before you go out and press that fast forward button, I’m hoping, I’m praying, that you’ll have the courage to first press the pause button.

That’s right, the pause button. I hope if you learn anything from me today, you learn and remember the power of the pause.Pausing allows you to take a beat, to take a breath in your life. As everybody else is rushing around like a lunatic out there, I dare you to do the opposite.I’m asking you to do this, because I believe you have an important opportunity in front of you, graduates of The Annenberg School of Communication.

I’m asking you to learn how to pause because I believe the state of our communication is out of control. And you? I believe you have the incredible opportunity to fix it.You have the power, each and every one of you, to change the way we as a nation speak to one another. I truly believe you can change our national discourse for the better. You have the chance to change the way we talk to one another, what we read on the Web and newspapers and magazines, what we see on TV, what we hear on radio. You can help us change the channel.

I’m hoping you young men and women dare to bring change to our community by changing our communication. Change it from criticism and fault-finding to understanding and compassion. Change it from nay-saying and name-calling to acceptance and appreciation.Change it from dissembling and dishonesty to openness and explanation.Change from screaming to speaking.

Show us the way, Annenberg graduates. Take us out to what I’ve been calling “The Open Field”. Go there! Go beyond! I know you can do it because a communications degree means nothing today unless you know how to go beyond the easy into the unknown unless you know how to pause, how to listen.I know quite a bit about the communication business. I’ve done it through my TV news work, my books, and my website, in magazines, speeches, blogs, and conferences. And if you thought I was going to come here today to tell you how I’ve done all that, the answer is pretty simple. I worked my butt off!

You’ll have to work your butt off, too, but today, I’m saying that while you do that, it’s really important to pause along the way and take a break from communicating outwardly, so you can communicate inwardly, with yourself.

Pause and take the time to find out, what’s important to you. Find out what you love, what’s real and true to you — so it can infuse and inform your work and make it your own. Pause before you report something you don’t know is absolutely true, something that you haven’t corroborated with not just one, but two sources, as I was taught. And make sure that they’re two reliable sources. Pause before you put a rumor out there as fact. Just because you read it or saw it on TV or the Web, no matter how many times, doesn’t mean it’s true. Don’t just pass on garbage because you want to be first. There’s no glory in being first with garbage. Pause before you hit the “send” button and forward a picture that could ruin someone’s life — or write something nasty on someone’s Wall because you think it’s funny or clever. Believe me, it isn’t. Pause before you make judgments about people’s personal or professional decisions. Pause before you join in and disparage someone’s sexuality or intellectual ability. Pause before forwarding the untrue and inflammatory tidbits that have made it so difficult for would-be public servants and their families to step up and lead. Edmund Hillary once said, “It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.”

Sometimes when you pause, you’ll realize you’re going to have to hold yourself back from acting out on your ego and your first impulse. Remember this; you have a degree from a prestigious Communication School. Communication has so much power to do good. Look at Kony-2012. And what about Egypt and Libya! In almost an instant, communicators toppled dictators and governments in place for decades!

That’s power, and with power, comes responsibility.

So remember to pause and reflect before you sign on with someone or some organization whose work you don’t admire and respect. Who you work for is as important as what you do.And if you don’t have a job yet and someone asks you “What are you going to do?” Just pause, and be aware of this fundamental truth, it’s okay not to know what you’re going to do! It’s okay not to have all the answers. You don’t have to be like I was at your age and beat yourself up for not knowing.

It’s okay to go with the truth and tell people, “You know what? It’s a tough job market out there. I’m not sure what I’m going be doing. I’m pausing, I’m open, and I’m looking at my options.” Hey, that’s exactly what I’m saying to people these days and so far, so good!And while you’re waiting for that perfect job, know this, there are so many incredible nonprofits out there doing important high-impact life-changing work. They can use your brains and talent in the meantime to help them communicate their mission and message.

You know, I didn’t invent this stop-everything-and-pause idea.Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the desert. Henry David Thoreau went to Walden Pond. Ann Morrow Lindberg went to the sea. Buddha, Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the greatest and wisest have often stopped and withdrawn from active lives to journey within themselves. The wisdom they garnered there and shared with us has impacted the world.

But, hey, don’t worry! I’m not asking you for 40 days and nights! I’m only asking you to stop every so often and turn off your mobile device, put down the Angry Birds and the Words with Friends and take a moment. Stop to look up and look around. Pause and check in with yourself and spend a moment there.

Feel your strength and your vulnerability. Acknowledge your goodness, and don’t be afraid of it. Look at your darkness and work to understand it, so you’ll have the power to choose who you’ll be in the world.

Women, look at your toughness and your softness. You can and should make room for both in your life. The world needs both. Men, find your gentleness, and wrap it into your manliness. You, too, can make room for both. The greatest men do.

Today, I pray that you will be able to pause and spend time with yourself to give thanks for the journey that has brought you here. Express your gratitude today to all those who made your journey possible.

Be grateful for all the love you have in your life and all the love you’ve ever had.And while you’re at it, how about pausing and doing something refreshingly different? Like talking to your mother or father or someone else you care deeply about, not just texting them but talking to them with your mouth!

And dare I suggest that you pause and write an actual thank you note with a pen on paper? Believe it or not, there are people like me who never hire anybody who didn’t send them a hand-written note thanking them for the interview.

As for me, the truth is that today, I am deeply grateful. Grateful for the life I’ve lived that has brought me here and all the experiences I’ve had that have made me the communicator I am.Today I’m pausing to be in awe of this moment, that I’m attending my first child’s college graduation. Katherine, I’m in awe of you. I’m in awe of the woman you are, your grace and courage and strength. I’m so proud of all of you and what you’ve done to get here.

Oh, how this world needs you, young men and women with the guts to pause and acknowledge where you’re at and how you got here and then to change course if you need to and trust me, sometimes you’ll need to change course! But know you’ve got the strength to do it.

So today, as you head out into the Open Field of life, keep your mind open, keep your heart open. Don’t be afraid to be afraid. Courageous people often are afraid. In fact, that’s why they need courage in the first place!

Have the courage to go beyond your fears. Have the courage to go beyond judgment. Have the courage go beyond “shoulda-could-woulda.” Go beyond others’ rules and expectations.Live and write your own story and then be brave enough to communicate it authentically. Trust me, someone else will be inspired by it and learn from it.

Be committed to communicating the truth. Don’t get so caught up along the way in what you’re doing and where you’re going that you lose sight of your core values: who you are and what’s important in your life

And finally, remember this, whenever you’re in doubt, pause and take a moment. Look at your options and check your intentions and then take the high road. Got it?

OK, then, that’s it! End of lesson.So now, Annenberg class of 2012 get out there and start communicating!Fight to make a difference in this world.Fight for good. Fight for fairness. Fight on!

I often say that the very best day of my life was college graduation. I've had two really very nice weddings. And I have a wonderful daughter and the day she was born was lovely, but really all of those days were complicated by all sorts of other things, so I always say that the one day that was pure joy was the day I graduated from college. You should also know I am a high-school dropout; I don't have a GED or a high school diploma, so it was also the day that it was clear that I was not going to have to go back to Central Virginia to high school. But I think after that moment it is possible now that your college graduation day is my favorite day! 

Good morning. I do, in fact, bring greetings from—apparently only the New York branch of—Nerdland. 

My producers are incredibly excited to have you all as part of our big community. Apparently the Nielsen Ratings tell us that everyone who watches our show is over 70 and so it is really quite lovely to see that that must be empirically false because here you all are. 

Now that said, if you’ve been following me on Twitter, then you know that despite the fact that I actually make my living doing public speaking, I have been nervous about this morning. And I'm nervous because this is a commencement address. When I'm in class, my work is about leading students through complicated readings or it's about explaining texts or working through difficult concepts. When I'm on television I do story telling and analysis and sometimes a little reacting. And I could do all of those things right here, but it does feel like a commencement address somehow ought to impart wisdom, to give advice. And the fact is I'm very bad at giving advice. 

Now, I guess what I really mean is I'm bad at giving advice en masse. If we were girls—if ya'll were my people...—and we were just sitting together talking about something, I would probably give you way too much advice. But the fact is that I don’t know what is about to happen for you. Some of you are going to become fabulously wealthy through hard work or inheritance or marriage or divorce. Some of you will be barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck through hard work or inheritance or marriage or divorce. Some of you are going to love your work, and you are going to wake up each day as though you are answering a calling. And others will beat the crap out of the alarm clock because it is telling you it is another workday. Some of you will marry the right man the first time, and for some of you it will take until your second marriage to marry the right woman. And plenty, plenty, plenty of you will embrace the delightful pleasures of both solitude or partnership without state interference.

Some of you are going to return to your 20th reunion with sour-faced teenagers in tow, and others will still be chasing toddlers. Some of you will return as men. Some of you are going to enjoy robust health into your eighties and some of you are going to succumb to illness and tragedy long before we are ready to lose you. 

So I don’t know how to give you advice, because I don't know which one of you will be walking on which paths, and it's such a complicated territory. So I thought, I'm going to outsource the advice-giving. 

My first sense was that I would synthesize the advice of famous and important thinkers who have told us how to be successful. 

So I started, of course, being a Unitarian Universalist from the crib, with Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American transcendentalist. And this is a pretty good definition of advice:
"To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded! "

That’s nice. That's pretty, right? You could put that on your wall. I am a bit partial, though, to another take on success. This one by the hard-drinking, misanthropic WC Fields who advises: "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then give up. No use in being a damn fool about it. "

There is a world full of great quotes but no matter how much I tried to create them into an outsourced advice lecture for you, none of them felt quite right. So, I thought, I know: I'll do a children's book theme.

I know if you’ve read The Velveteen Principles then you know that everything that you need to know about how to have an authentic, successful life is actually conveyed in the book The Velveteen Rabbit.

I thought, I’ll do a little riff on Mo Willems' with "The Pigeon Principles." series. You know the Pigeon books? Don’t Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late. Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus. (I'm sorry, I have a 10-year-old; this is what I read.) At first glance Pigeon is selfish and whiny, manipulative... but if you read the pigeon with love, we will see that the pigeon actually gives us clues about how to be persuasive, kind, adventurous, and assertive. It would have been a great speech—I was going to tell you how to look at your own sometimes whiny, narcissistic self with love and actually find your best selves underneath all that fragility. 

But it occurred to me it might annoy your parents if they discovered after four years of very expensive college education, that everything you needed to know to succeed you'd already read in the second grade. Hip-Hop

Now I do have to say, thank God that Kate and Haley said Beyoncé before I did. It is an indication that you are truly a part of Nerdland if you too love Beyoncé! Beyoncé... OK! So after I'd gotten through the great men advice and the pigeon parables, I thought, how about hip-hop? I mean, who better to give advice to young graduates going off into recession-era America than rappers! 

We’ve got KRS One asking, “Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher/ it’s not about salary it’s about reality.” It's good, right? It's a nice message—you know, pick the thing you love that makes a difference not self-importance. 

We've got The Roots—right? And in their track, “Thoughts @ Work," they say: “F--- gettin’ money, for real, get freedom.” That's a good message, right? Right. Follow your passion, don't follow the money. 

And then of course I got to the most important piece of hip-hop advice ever dispensed by that prophet, the Notorious B.I.G. “Never get high on your own supply.” 

At that point I decided maybe the hip-hop lecture was ill advised. 

So then I decided, that's right, Wellesley is a women's college and sometimes there is advice specifically for "girls," "working girls" entering out into the working world.

So I thought I could just tell you a bit about some things I’ve learned as a working girl. 

Here's one of them: “Don’t nod and smile unless you are happy and agree.”

“Don’t let your voice do that high-pitch thing at the end that makes it sound like you are asking a questions when really you're making a statement?” 
“Once you have secured your Wellesley degree, and particularly if you follow it up with an Ivy League law degree, never forsake your high-profile career path and advocacy to follow some dude to a godforsaken region of the American South, like Arkansas….” 

Whoops.

See how the girl advice doesn't always work out? In fact, sometimes it can be quite powerful to nod and smile just before you punch him in the neck, and sometimes a little question at the end of your declarative statement is a worthwhile way to get some of the old guys who run all the money thing on your side, and sometimes you follow your heart and you go with the big tall guy down to Arkansas and it all works out just fine. 

So I decided that the girl advice was no good. And in the end I was left with having to do what I didn't want to do, which was that I've just got to give you the best advice that I've got.

I've got three things I want to ask you to be as you move forward, and I think these might be kind of counterintuitive, particularly coming from a political progressive who is unashamedly feminist, concerned with racial and economic and environmental justice, but here are the three things I'm going to ask of you: 

Be ignorant.

Be silent. 

Be thick. 

Now, I could do the little Ashanta move here—she's one of my producers—I'd do that little: You didn't think I was gonna say that, huh? Right, OK. 

Be ignorant, be silent, and be thick. 

Be Ignorant

In a few moments you're going to walk across this stage and you're going to have your accomplishments acknowledged in the acquisition of a certification that you KNOW something.

But even as you accept your hard won degree, I encourage you to embrace the reality that you know almost nothing. 

I love my iPad. I'm reading my lecture right now from my iPad. I love that it streams books and knowledge and information to me, Matrix-like, at a moment. Like, toowoosh! anything that I need to know. But it is important for me to pretty regularly just go stand in the library. It is an AWE-full experience standing in a library. I think of myself as quite accomplished. I've written two books—heh hey. But when you stand in the library and you are surrounded by those stacks of all of those thousands of volumes of texts of things that you know nothing about, written in languages that you cannot decipher, on topics you can barely fathom, it is humbling.

Standing in a library reminds us of our own limitations. It encourages us to remember that we don’t know everything, can’t predict every outcome, and don’t even know all the right questions to ask.

I will never fill a cavity. It is pretty unlikely that I will ever speak Mandarin. I am certainly not going to decode anything in the DNA chain. But thankfully, graciously, the universe provides an interdependent web of other fantastic women who will. Remembering our ignorance, embracing our ignorance, allowing our ourselves to accept a posture of ignorance compels us to keep learning. 
There will come a September morning pretty soon when you are going to miss this place. And not just the buildings and not just your friends. You are going to miss a new syllabus. You're going to miss somebody handing you a piece of paper full of things that you've not thought about yet. About challenges you didn't even know existed. The exquisite moment of utter ignorance just before the learning begins: I promise you, you will miss it. 

So remember, ignorance is not your enemy, only complacency with ignorance is to be resisted. Never become so enamored of your own smarts that you stop signing up for life’s hard classes. Remember to keep forming hypotheses and gathering data. Keep your conclusions light and your curiosity ferocious. Keep groping in the darkness with ravenous desire. 

Ignorance is not incompatible with excellence. It is not incompatible with leadership. It is not incompatible with greatness. Ignorance is a posture of humility, which brings me to the other piece of nontraditional advice: Be silent.
Be Silent If the Nerdland staff is watching right now they probably just fell out of their chairs, because I know they didn't even know I could be silent as long as I just was. And, in fact, not just the Nerdland staff but we share space in 30 Rock right next to the Up staff. And the Up staff is really quite diligent. They're very quiet, they type along. And when I come in, usually on Thursdays or Fridays, the screaming begins. I sit in my office where I don't much like to be alone and I scream, "Oh my god! Have you read the script today?! Come in here and talk to me! Come! Come! Come!" Sometimes they just shut the door.

I am, in being a feminist and having been trained as a feminist, become very good at using my voice.

Women’s education is very much about finding your voice. About learning to speak, about speaking with confidence, about sharing your ideas freely, about battling the boys.

But there is an enormous difference between being silenced and choosing to be silent. When we are silenced, you have something to say but no one will listen. When you choose to be silent, to quiet it down, to listen, you've actually exercised the other part of voice. The part that makes your voice sound like something. It sounds like something in comparison to the silence.
Silence can help to soothe one of the voices that you actually would like to be more quiet more frequently. It's what Jay-Smooth would call your “internal hater.” That little hater. I don't know if boys have the hater. Girls have the hater. The hater sits on our shoulder and tells us, "Sit up straight." "Omigod, you have a lisp. Why are are you talking?"

The little hater fusses at us and tells us that we are insufficient, and suggests that we "can't do math, because it's hard." She is actually soothed by silence. You can actually encourage that part of your meta-narrative voice to be quiet so that this part of your voice can speak. And silence allows you to do something else that you now have as Wellesley women.

You have privilege. No matter what circumstances of dis-privilege you came from, this degree now confers upon you privilege. And when you choose to be silent in the face of those who have less privilege, you undermine the idea that only people with certain degrees and certain certifications have a right to speak.

So, I’m not asking you to silence your advocacy for justice or to mute your voice as a citizen. I am not asking you to accept the opinions of others as your own truths. I am not asking you to sit on your ideas or fail to share your skills. I am asking you to remember that silence is the vital precursor to voice. Gather your voice in your silence. Listen to it in your own head before you give it away. Wake up, roll over, and make love to the day wordlessly. 

My final piece of advice is this: Be thick. Be Thick In a world that teaches women to be thin, be thick.

Recall the moment in Toni Morrison’s Beloved when Paul D says to Sethe:
“ Your love is too thick, Sethe,” and she responds:
“Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't no love at all.”

Thick is the only thing worth being. When you are thick you unconditionally embrace the object of your attention. Thick women make fools of themselves all the time, because thin women stand on the sidelines; they're critical; they're removed; they're barely committed. Thick people pitch tents in a park with the belief that social action can change an entire international global system of economic injustice. 

Thin citizens vote; thick citizens run for office. 

Thin folks believe every critic is a “hater.” Thick folks can hear critique without crumbling.

Thin leaders stay the course no matter what the evidence sat. Thick leaders listen, learn, and correct.

Thin women look great in bikinis. Thick women look terrific in history books.
Cultivate a radical thickness that allows you to be vulnerable and imperfect as you cast yourself headlong into the crazy, scary, painful, grown-up world. Conclusion
Which brings me to the end. Be ignorant, and silent, and thick. But don't do it alone.

You cannot be brave all by yourself. Everybody's got to have a Charlotte. You know, Charlotte's Web.

You're going to be Wilbur a lot. Remember the naïve little pig who learns of his own impending demise? His future as bacon? And remember Charlotte, the little spider, who did more than craft and execute a plan for Wilbur. She also was his friend.

You will be Wilbur over and over, and you're going to need a Charlotte.

Now, when Wilbur first met Charlotte, Wilbur was not sure. Wilbur thought to himself , "Well, I've got a new friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is! Charlotte is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty—everything I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even though she is pretty and, of course, clever?"
Your Charlotte is probably not packaged neatly. Your Charlotte is probably a little scheming and bloodthirsty and she probably never nods and smiles or says declarative statements like a question. She probably watches Nerdland. You're going to need

But find your Charlotte. You are going to need a soul mate. You're going to need the courage. You're going to need for somebody to write in their web, "No, really, you are Some Pig."

But more than anyone else, all the advice I gave you from hip-hop, from children's books, from the great men, and even my notion of ignorant, silent thickness--let it all go if it's not right for you. Just throw it all away. Because this is the start of your day.Thank you.

Tar…

Forgive me. I wanted to start this morning by shouting something but I knew what would happen if I said, ‘Rah-rah, Carolina-lina! Rah-rah, Carolina-lina! Rah-rah, Carolina-lina!’

On that positive note, good morning, faculty, family, friends of the Great Class of 2012! I want to thank Chancellor Thorp and the UNC Board of Trustees, including my friend and your fellow alum, Peter Grauer, for inviting me here. I also want to thank the president of the UNC system, Thomas Ross and a former UNC system president, my old friend Dick Spangler. You should know that we both went to Harvard Business School just because we couldn’t get into UNC.

I am thrilled to be standing here today and not only because UNC is one of our country’s oldest and greatest institutions. I am thrilled to be standing here because it means I did not trip on the bricks walking over here. It’s really treacherous out there.I know this is only one of the many challenges you have all overcome on the way to your diplomas today: You’ve battled your way through trying to find a parking space on campus, you’ve battled your way through trying to register for classes on ‘Connect Carolina,’ you’ve battled through living in Hinton James and having to walk in the rain to an 8 a.m. class at Graham Memorial and you’ve battled through many games of Zombies and Humans. I have to admit I’d never heard of that game, but it does sound like good preparation for anyone who will be moving to Washington, D.C.

You’ve survived it all and here you are. However, while this is a very special day for you graduates, before imparting some of my invaluable, indispensible words of wisdom, I would like to say something about another important group here today.

They are sitting out there this morning, beaming proudly, and not even thinking about what it cost to get to this day or what happens if you can’t get a job and have to move back home. I’m talking about your parents and relatives so let’s give them a big hand. And since this is not only a very special day here but a very special day across our country let me wish all the mothers here, happy Mother’s Day.

Being asked to speak at UNC is really a dream come true for me and I want this commencement speech to be different from any speech that’s ever been given. In light of recent events here at Chapel Hill, there was really only one way to do that. So I planned to ‘Slow-Jam the Commencement Address.’ Unfortunately I couldn’t convince Branford Marsalis to join me.

I’m still determined to make this memorable, so I did a lot of research to put me fully into the UNC groove. Since I arrived this morning, I’ve already climbed the bell tower and signed my name. I sat on the Davie Poplar Bench. I challenged Chancellor Thorp to a Rubik’s Cube contest and got my butt whipped. I drank out of the Old Well for good luck, someone warned me to be careful, some fraternity guys had just been there, but I did it anyway. Finally I joined a Flash Rave at the Library and I watched, but did not join, a group of streakers run across the Pit into the UL and then sing the alma mater.
It’s been a great morning and I haven’t even played a few rounds of Senior Bar Golf yet. So I’m feeling almost as prepared for today as you graduates are. You’ve made it. You’ve done it. You’ve earned it.

I’m sure this past week has been spent re-living memories and re-telling stories. I know there will be more of that tonight. Right now, take a look around you and think not about where everyone has been, but where they are going.

The guy in front of you could win an Academy Award someday. The girl behind you could be a future President of the United States or even, better than that, the Mayor of New York City. That guy sitting to your right could be a future Nobel laureate. Okay, maybe not the guy to your right, but certainly the one to your left.

There’s no telling what the future holds for you, or for anyone else. This is an exciting time in your life and it’s an exciting time in history. More than any other generation that has walked the Earth, you are free to pursue your dreams, unbounded by limits placed on your race, gender, ethnicity, orientation, or lineage.

Only a lack of education can hold you back in America and today you’ve cleared that bar, and you’ve done it at one of country’s finest institutions. Your freedom coupled with the diploma you will receive today is something that people around the world would risk life and limb for. Don’t ever take it for granted. It has been won through suffering and sacrifice by freedom fighters and freedom riders, by abolitionists and suffragettes. It has been won at the ballot box and on the battlefield, in state houses and court houses. The path of victory has not always been straight or swift, but it has been sure and steady.

That has been the story of America, stretching back to our earliest days. At our nation’s founding, African-Americans were held in bondage. Those without property could not vote. Catholics could not hold office. Women could not vote or hold office and homosexuality was, in some places, a crime punishable by death but over time, we understood that freedoms that are not fully shared are not fully safe. If government can deny freedom to one, it can deny freedom to all. Exclusion and equality are mortal enemies and in America, every time they have met in battle, equality has ultimately triumphed.

Throughout our history, each and every generation has expanded upon the freedoms won by their parents and grandparents. Each and every generation has removed some barrier to full participation in the American dream. The work is not over, far from it. I would argue that last week’s referendum banning same-sex marriage shows just how much more work needs to be done to ensure freedom and equality for all people.

When the torch passes from one generation to the next, the light of liberty always shines more brightly. I have no doubt that in your lifetime, liberty’s light will allow us to see more clearly the truth of our nation’s founding principles and allow us to see all people, and all couples, as full and equal members of the American family. The progress that freedom’s journey is making is only half of what makes this moment in history so exciting.

The other half is symbolized by something that you are probably holding in your hand or your pocket right now, your phone. The Smart Phone is arguably the greatest invention the world has ever seen and the reason is simple. It democratizes technology.Today, whether you’re building an App, or writing a review on Yelp, or checking in on Four Square, you are making the computer, and everyone who uses it, smarter. Since the dawn of time, we have been sharing knowledge with each other but today, knowledge is being shared globally as quickly as it is being discovered individually. That revolution in computer-based communications, which started in government laboratories and in Steve Jobs’s garage and in the little office I first rented 30 years ago is now being led by the masses.

Whether you like it or not, the computer nerds have won. We’re all computer nerds now. The creation of the Smart Phone is the most visible symbol of the technological revolution we’re experiencing but it’s happening all around us. In every industry the speed of innovation is moving at a breathtaking pace. You can see it just down the road at Research Triangle Park. You can see it in Silicon Valley and in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. All of those places are home to great universities where pioneering work is being done and good jobs are being created.

In New York City, we’ve joined forces with Cornell University, NYU, and Carnegie Mellon, as well as The Technion Institute of Technology in Israel, and universities in Canada, the UK, and India to develop new, world-class applied science and engineering campuses. We know the future of the global economy is tied to the discoveries that are made by university-educated researchers and innovators. If those discoveries happen in New York City, we know the companies that spin off from them will start in New York City.

I have no doubt that many of you here today will be part of those discoveries. Your work will re-shape our understanding of the world, everything from the origins of the universe to the cure for cancer.
For the non-scientists here, you too will have an important job to play. You business and finance majors, you may be providing the capital for the discoveries to be brought to the market. Education and journalism majors, you may be writing or teaching about those discoveries. Nursing and pre-med students, you may be talking to patients about them and you future lawyers, yes, lawyers always have to be involved in everything we do, you will be needed to protect patents, and of course, fight off other lawyers.The technology revolution that is re-shaping our understanding of the world, and the freedom that you enjoy to pursue your dreams, are complementary. They reinforce each other. The more we learn, the freer we will be and the freer we are, the more we will learn.

“Lux libertas,” “light and liberty” that is the motto of your university. That, I believe, will be the defining spirit of the 21st Century. The more light we shed on the nature of the world, the more we advanced knowledge in science and technology, the more liberty we will spread.

In fact, I would argue that the technological revolution that is now underway will not only be our most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty and disease, it will be our most powerful weapon in the fight against repression and intolerance because where there is light, liberty grows and where there is liberty, light flows.

Now, it’s up to all of you, in your own way, to take what you have learned here, and spread light and liberty wherever you go. That may sound like a daunting task. And I understand if you’re thinking, “Sure, I’ll be happy to do that – once I find a job!”

Whether you have a job lined up or are still figuring out your next step, don’t think you’ve got your career all figured out. No plan for the rest of your life ever works out the way you thought it would.

I was an engineering major who then went to business school in hopes of someday running a factory, which I knew nothing about. I got the MBA and then I took an entry level job in the financial services industry, which I knew nothing about. Fifteen years later, I got fired and I started a company in another industry I knew nothing about, information technology. 20 years after that, I ran for mayor even though I knew nothing about politics. Some people say I still don’t.

You don’t need a grand plan. Whatever plan you do have is probably going to change 100 times before you’re 30 years old and you don’t need to be an expert in something to try it. So what, then, do you need to do? I’m going to tell you, but really, all I’m going to do is remind you of a few things you’ve already learned here just by watching Carolina basketball.

First, make career decisions the same way you fill out your tournament brackets. Follow your heart, and go with your gut. Do what you love, find a way to get paid for it and if you ever have the luxury of multiple job offers, don’t make the decision based on salary alone. When I was starting out, I turned down a job with a higher salary because I had a good feeling about the people at another firm. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. Your gut won’t always be right. For example, who knew NC State would make the Sweet 16? You’ll sleep better at night if you go with it.

Second, out-hustle the competition. When I started my first job out of college, I made sure I was the first one into the office every morning and the last one to leave. Not only did it save me the price of the Wall Street Journal because I just grabbed the office copy, it allowed me to get to know the firm’s partners. Woody Allen once said that 80 percent of success is showing up. I think he got it half-right. 80 percent of success is showing up early and staying late.

Third, you occasionally have to throw some elbows. It’s true; it’s rough out there, no matter what profession you’re in. Of course, in most professions, you don’t break your wrist driving to the basket, thankfully. The world is competitive. I’ve been in the business world and I’ve been in government and people ask me all the time what the difference is. I always tell them, “The business world is dog-eat-dog and in government, it’s exactly the reverse.” So don’t be afraid to assert yourself. Have confidence in your abilities and don’t let the bastards get you down.

Fourth, teamwork is everything. I could never have built my company without the three brilliant guys I started it with. Whatever success I’ve achieved as mayor results from surrounding myself with the most talented people I could find.

The innovations that are coming out of the Research Triangle Park and Silicon Valley and New York City are built on teamwork. The person who works the hardest and works with others the best, who says ‘we’ and ‘us,’ not ‘I’ and ‘me’ is the person who wins.

Fifth, don’t be afraid to shoot the long ball. Take the risk. Life is too short to spend your time avoiding failure. If I had worried about failure or listened to those who do, I would never have started my company, and never run for mayor. I can’t imagine my life if I hadn’t taken those risks. Not every risk will work out, but that’s ok. Failure is the world’s best teacher.

Sixth, never stop studying what the competition is doing and never stop learning. Education is a lifetime journey. When you leave these walls, keep asking questions. Keep acquiring knowledge. Keep seeking truth.

Don’t let party labels blind you. No party has a monopoly on truth, or God on its side. I should know. I was a Democrat before I was a Republican before I became an independent and I never changed my principles.

I have enormous respect for your former President, and my friend, Erskine Bowles, because he puts pragmatism ahead of partisanship. I hope all of you will do exactly that. Think for yourself and decide for yourself, even if it’s not popular or if it runs counter to the party line. If everyone in Washington did that our country would be a whole lot better off.

Now, the seventh and the final piece of advice I have is in the game of life, when the final buzzer sounds, the only stat you carry with you is the number of assists you made. So help other people put some points on the board or as Dickie V. might say, “Don’t be slow to dish the rock.” There’s nothing more rewarding than making a difference in the lives of others. I’ve learned that first hand, both through philanthropy and public service. Give what you can: your time, your talents, your money and I promise you, you will never forget it.

Now, I know you remembered every word of that but just in case, I thought I’d provide a summary of the seven, in no particular order. Teamwork is everything. Assist others. Risks are necessary. The first three letters of those words are T-A-R. I wonder where this is going. Hustle, always. Elbows occasionally have to be used. Education is a lifelong journey. Love what you do and if you put that list together, it of course spells Tar Heel.

Before I leave you to receive your diploma and leave, I just have one more piece of wisdom to share. When the hard times come in your life and they will, and when the doubts creep in about whether God is looking out for you, just remember that not only did you see an NCAA Basketball Championship during your time here but in your senior year Duke lost in the first round to a 15th seed.

So you know there’s a God up there in that Carolina Blue Sky.

Congratulations and good luck!

Thank you. President Tilghman. Trustees and Friends. Parents of the Class of 2012. Above all, Members of the Princeton Class of 2012. Give yourself a round of applause. The next time you look around a church and see everyone dressed in black it’ll be awkward to cheer. Enjoy the moment.

Thirty years ago I sat where you sat. I must have listened to some older person share his life experience. But I don’t remember a word of it. I can’t even tell you who spoke. What I do remember, vividly, is graduation. I’m told you’re meant to be excited, perhaps even relieved, and maybe all of you are. I wasn’t. I was totally outraged. Here I’d gone and given them four of the best years of my life and this is how they thanked me for it. By kicking me out.  

At that moment I was sure of only one thing: I was of no possible economic value to the outside world. I’d majored in art history, for a start. Even then this was regarded as an act of insanity. I was almost certainly less prepared for the marketplace than most of you. Yet somehow I have wound up rich and famous. Well, sort of. I’m going to explain, briefly, how that happened. I want you to understand just how mysterious careers can be, before you go out and have one yourself.

I graduated from Princeton without ever having published a word of anything, anywhere. I didn’t write for the Prince, or for anyone else. But at Princeton, studying art history, I felt the first twinge of literary ambition. It happened while working on my senior thesis. My adviser was a truly gifted professor, an archaeologist named William Childs. The thesis tried to explain how the Italian sculptor Donatello used Greek and Roman sculpture — which is actually totally beside the point, but I’ve always wanted to tell someone. God knows what Professor Childs actually thought of it, but he helped me to become engrossed. More than engrossed: obsessed. When I handed it in I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: to write senior theses. Or, to put it differently: to write books. 

Then I went to my thesis defense. It was just a few yards from here, in McCormick Hall. I listened and waited for Professor Childs to say how well written my thesis was. He didn’t. And so after about 45 minutes I finally said, “So. What did you think of the writing?”

“Put it this way” he said. “Never try to make a living at it.”

And I didn’t — not really. I did what everyone does who has no idea what to do with themselves: I went to graduate school. I wrote at nights, without much effect, mainly because I hadn’t the first clue what I should write about. One night I was invited to a dinner, where I sat next to the wife of a big shot at a giant Wall Street investment bank, called Salomon Brothers. She more or less forced her husband to give me a job. I knew next to nothing about Salomon Brothers. But Salomon Brothers happened to be where Wall Street was being reinvented—into the place we have all come to know and love. When I got there I was assigned, almost arbitrarily, to the very best job in which to observe the growing madness: they turned me into the house expert on derivatives. A year and a half later Salomon Brothers was handing me a check for hundreds of thousands of dollars to give advice about derivatives to professional investors.  

Now I had something to write about: Salomon Brothers. Wall Street had become so unhinged that it was paying recent Princeton graduates who knew nothing about money small fortunes to pretend to be experts about money. I’d stumbled into my next senior thesis.

I called up my father. I told him I was going to quit this job that now promised me millions of dollars to write a book for an advance of 40 grand. There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “You might just want to think about that,” he said. 

“Why?”

“Stay at Salomon Brothers 10 years, make your fortune, and then write your books,” he said.  

I didn’t need to think about it. I knew what intellectual passion felt like — because I’d felt it here, at Princeton — and I wanted to feel it again. I was 26 years old. Had I waited until I was 36, I would never have done it. I would have forgotten the feeling.   

The book I wrote was called “Liar’s Poker.”  It sold a million copies. I was 28 years old. I had a career, a little fame, a small fortune and a new life narrative. All of a sudden people were telling me I was born to be a writer. This was absurd. Even I could see there was another, truer narrative, with luck as its theme. What were the odds of being seated at that dinner next to that Salomon Brothers lady? Of landing inside the best Wall Street firm from which to write the story of an age? Of landing in the seat with the best view of the business? Of having parents who didn’t disinherit me but instead sighed and said “do it if you must?” Of having had that sense of must kindled inside me by a professor of art history at Princeton? Of having been let into Princeton in the first place?

This isn’t just false humility. It’s false humility with a point. My case illustrates how success is always rationalized. People really don’t like to hear success explained away as luck — especially successful people. As they age, and succeed, people feel their success was somehow inevitable. They don’t want to acknowledge the role played by accident in their lives. There is a reason for this: the world does not want to acknowledge it either. 

I wrote a book about this, called “Moneyball.” It was ostensibly about baseball but was in fact about something else. There are poor teams and rich teams in professional baseball, and they spend radically different sums of money on their players. When I wrote my book the richest team in professional baseball, the New York Yankees, was then spending about $120 million on its 25 players. The poorest team, the Oakland A’s, was spending about $30 million. And yet the Oakland team was winning as many games as the Yankees — and more than all the other richer teams.  

This isn’t supposed to happen. In theory, the rich teams should buy the best players and win all the time. But the Oakland team had figured something out: the rich teams didn’t really understand who the best baseball players were. The players were misvalued. And the biggest single reason they were misvalued was that the experts did not pay sufficient attention to the role of luck in baseball success. Players got given credit for things they did that depended on the performance of others: pitchers got paid for winning games, hitters got paid for knocking in runners on base. Players got blamed and credited for events beyond their control. Where balls that got hit happened to land on the field, for example.

Forget baseball, forget sports. Here you had these corporate employees, paid millions of dollars a year. They were doing exactly the same job that people in their business had been doing forever.  In front of millions of people, who evaluate their every move. They had statistics attached to everything they did. And yet they were misvalued — because the wider world was blind to their luck. 

This had been going on for a century. Right under all of our noses. And no one noticed — until it paid a poor team so well to notice that they could not afford not to notice. And you have to ask: if a professional athlete paid millions of dollars can be misvalued who can’t be? If the supposedly pure meritocracy of professional sports can’t distinguish between lucky and good, who can? 

The “Moneyball” story has practical implications. If you use better data, you can find better values; there are always market inefficiencies to exploit, and so on. But it has a broader and less practical message: don’t be deceived by life’s outcomes. Life’s outcomes, while not entirely random, have a huge amount of luck baked into them. Above all, recognize that if you have had success, you have also had luck — and with  luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your Gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky.

I make this point because — along with this speech — it is something that will be easy for you to forget.

I now live in Berkeley, California. A few years ago, just a few blocks from my home, a pair of researchers in the Cal psychology department staged an experiment. They began by grabbing students, as lab rats. Then they broke the students into teams, segregated by sex. Three men, or three women, per team. Then they put these teams of three into a room, and arbitrarily assigned one of the three to act as leader. Then they gave them some complicated moral problem to solve: say what should be done about academic cheating, or how to regulate drinking on campus.

Exactly 30 minutes into the problem-solving the researchers interrupted each group. They entered the room bearing a plate of cookies. Four cookies. The team consisted of three people, but there were these four cookies. Every team member obviously got one cookie, but that left a fourth cookie, just sitting there. It should have been awkward. But it wasn’t. With incredible consistency the person arbitrarily appointed leader of the group grabbed the fourth cookie, and ate it. Not only ate it, but ate it with gusto: lips smacking, mouth open, drool at the corners of their mouths. In the end all that was left of the extra cookie were crumbs on the leader’s shirt.

This leader had performed no special task. He had no special virtue. He’d been chosen at random, 30 minutes earlier. His status was nothing but luck. But it still left him with the sense that the cookie should be his.  

This experiment helps to explain Wall Street bonuses and CEO pay, and I’m sure lots of other human behavior. But it also is relevant to new graduates of Princeton University. In a general sort of way you have been appointed the leader of the group. Your appointment may not be entirely arbitrary. But you must sense its arbitrary aspect: you are the lucky few. Lucky in your parents, lucky in your country, lucky that a place like Princeton exists that can take in lucky people, introduce them to other lucky people, and increase their chances of becoming even luckier. Lucky that you live in the richest society the world has ever seen, in a time when no one actually expects you to sacrifice your interests to anything. 

All of you have been faced with the extra cookie. All of you will be faced with many more of them. In time you will find it easy to assume that you deserve the extra cookie. For all I know, you may. But you’ll be happier, and the world will be better off, if you at least pretend that you don’t. 

Never forget: In the nation’s service. In the service of all nations.

Thank you. 

I never really expected to find myself giving advice to people graduating from an establishment of higher education.  I never graduated from any such establishment. I never even started at one. I escaped from school as soon as I could, when the prospect of four more years of enforced learning before I'd become the writer I wanted to be was stifling.

I got out into the world, I wrote, and I became a better writer the more I wrote, and I wrote some more, and nobody ever seemed to mind that I was making it up as I went along, they just read what I wrote and they paid for it, or they didn't, and often they commissioned me to write something else for them.

Which has left me with a healthy respect and fondness for higher education that those of my friends and family, who attended Universities, were cured of long ago.

Looking back, I've had a remarkable ride. I'm not sure I can call it a career, because a career implies that I had some kind of career plan, and I never did. The nearest thing I had was a list I made when I was 15 of everything I wanted to do: to write an adult novel, a children's book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Who... and so on. I didn't have a career. I just did the next thing on the list.

So I thought I'd tell you everything I wish I'd known starting out, and a few things that, looking back on it, I suppose that I did know. And that I would also give you the best piece of advice I'd ever got, which I completely failed to follow.

First of all: When you start out on a career in the arts you have no idea what you are doing.

This is great. People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them. And you can.

If you don't know it's impossible it's easier to do. And because nobody's done it before, they haven't made up rules to stop anyone doing that again, yet.

Secondly, If you have an idea of what you want to make, what you were put here to do, then just go and do that.

And that's much harder than it sounds and, sometimes in the end, so much easier than you might imagine. Because normally, there are things you have to do before you can get to the place you want to be. I wanted to write comics and novels and stories and films, so I became a journalist, because journalists are allowed to ask questions, and to simply go and find out how the world works, and besides, to do those things I needed to write and to write well, and I was being paid to learn how to write economically,  crisply, sometimes under adverse conditions, and on time.

Sometimes the way to do what you hope to do will be clear cut, and sometimes  it will be almost impossible to decide whether or not you are doing the correct thing, because you'll have to balance your goals and hopes with feeding yourself, paying debts, finding work, settling for what you can get.

Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be – an author, primarily of fiction, making good books, making good comics and supporting myself through my words – was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal.

And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop, and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from the mountain. I said no to editorial jobs on magazines, proper jobs that would have paid proper money because I knew that, attractive though they were, for me they would have been walking away from the mountain. And if those job offers had come along earlier I might have taken them, because they still would have been closer to the mountain than I was at the time.

I learned to write by writing. I tended to do anything as long as it felt like an adventure, and to stop when it felt like work, which meant that life did not feel like work.

Thirdly, When you start off, you have to deal with the problems of failure. You need to be thickskinned, to learn that not every project will survive. A freelance life, a life in the arts, is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love. And you have to accept that you may put out a hundred things for every bottle that winds up coming back.

The problems of failure are problems of discouragement, of hopelessness, of hunger. You want everything to happen and you want it now, and things go wrong. My first book – a piece of journalism I had done for the money, and which had already bought me an electric typewriter  from the advance – should have been a bestseller. It should have paid me a lot of money. If the publisher hadn't gone into involuntary liquidation between the first print run selling out and the second printing, and before any royalties could be paid, it would have done.

And I shrugged, and I still had my electric typewriter and enough money to pay the rent for a couple of months, and I decided that I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn't get the money, then you didn't have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn't get the money, at least I'd have the work.

Every now and again, I forget that rule, and whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. I don't know that it's an issue for anybody but me, but it's true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually I didn't wind up getting the money, either.  The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and I've never regretted the time I spent on any of them.

The problems of failure are hard.

The problems of success can be harder, because nobody warns you about them.

The first problem of any kind of even limited success is the unshakable conviction that you are getting away with something, and that any moment now they will discover you. It's Imposter Syndrome, something my wife Amanda christened the Fraud Police.

In my case, I was convinced that there would be a knock on the door, and a man with a clipboard (I don't know why he carried a clipboard, in my head, but he did) would be there, to tell me it was all over, and they had caught up with me, and now I would have to go and get a real job, one that didn't consist of making things up and writing them down, and reading books I wanted to read. And then I would go away quietly and get the kind of job where you don't have to make things up any more.

The problems of success. They're real, and with luck you'll experience them. The point where you stop saying yes to everything, because now the bottles you threw in the ocean are all coming back, and have to learn to say no.

I watched my peers, and my friends, and the ones who were older than me and watch how miserable some of them were: I'd listen to them telling me that they couldn't envisage a world where they did what they had always wanted to do any more, because now they had to earn a certain amount every month just to keep where they were. They couldn't go and do the things that mattered, and that they had really wanted to do; and that seemed as a big a tragedy as any problem of failure.

And after that, the biggest problem of success is that the world conspires to stop you doing the thing that you do, because you are successful. There was a day when I looked up and realised that I had become someone who professionally replied to email, and who wrote as a hobby.  I started answering fewer emails, and was relieved to find I was writing much more.

Fourthly, I hope you'll make mistakes. If you're making mistakes, it means you're out there doing something. And the mistakes in themselves can be useful. I once misspelled Caroline, in a letter, transposing the A and the O, and I thought, “Coraline looks like a real name...”

And remember that whatever discipline you are in, whether you are a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a designer, whatever you do you have one thing that's unique. You have the ability to make art.

And for me, and for so many of the people I have known, that's been a lifesaver. The ultimate lifesaver. It gets you through good times and it gets you through the other ones.

Life is sometimes hard. Things go wrong, in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do.

Make good art.

I'm serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Somebody on the Internet thinks what you do is stupid or evil or it's all been done before? Make good art. Probably things will work out somehow, and eventually time will take the sting away, but that doesn't matter. Do what only you do best. Make good art.

Make it on the good days too.

And Fifthly, while you are at it, make your art. Do the stuff that only you can do.

The urge, starting out, is to copy. And that's not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after we've sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.

The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right.

The things I've done that worked the best were the things I was the least certain about, the stories where I was sure they would either work, or more likely be the kinds of embarrassing failures people would gather together and talk about  until the end of time. They always had that in common: looking back at them, people explain why they were inevitable successes. While I was doing them, I had no idea.

I still don't. And where would be the fun in making something you knew was going to work?

And sometimes the things I did really didn't work. There are stories of mine that have never been reprinted. Some of them never even left the house. But I learned as much from them as I did from the things that worked.

Sixthly. I will pass on some secret freelancer knowledge. Secret knowledge is always good. And it is useful for anyone who ever plans to create art for other people, to enter a freelance world of any kind. I learned it in comics, but it applies to other fields too. And it's this:

People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. In my case I did something which these days would be easy to check, and would get me into trouble, and when I started out, in those pre-internet days, seemed like a sensible career strategy: when I was asked by editors who I'd worked for, I lied. I listed a handful of magazines that sounded likely, and I sounded confident, and I got jobs. I then made it a point of honour to have written something for each of the magazines I'd listed to get that first job, so that I hadn't actually lied, I'd just been chronologically challenged... You get work however you get work.

People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today's world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. And you don't even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time. They'll forgive the lateness of the work if it's good, and if they like you. And you don't have to be as good as the others if you're on time and it's always a pleasure to hear from you.

When I agreed to give this address, I started trying to think what the best advice I'd been given over the years was.

And it came from Stephen King twenty years ago, at the height of the success of Sandman. I was writing a comic that people loved and were taking seriously. King had liked Sandman and my novel with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, and he saw the madness, the long signing lines, all that, and his advice was this:

“This is really great. You should enjoy it.”

And I didn't. Best advice I got that I ignored.Instead I worried about it. I worried about the next deadline, the next idea, the next story. There wasn't a moment for the next fourteen or fifteen years that I wasn't writing something in my head, or wondering about it. And I didn't stop and look around and go, this is really fun. I wish I'd enjoyed it more. It's been an amazing ride. But there were parts of the ride I missed, because I was too worried about things going wrong, about what came next, to enjoy the bit I was on.

That was the hardest lesson for me, I think: to let go and enjoy the ride, because the ride takes you to some remarkable and unexpected places.

And here, on this platform, today, is one of those places. (I am enjoying myself immensely.)

To all today's graduates: I wish you luck. Luck is useful. Often you will discover that the harder you work, and the more wisely you work, the luckier you get. But there is luck, and it helps.

We're in a transitional world right now, if you're in any kind of artistic field, because the nature of distribution is changing, the models by which creators got their work out into the world, and got to keep a roof over their heads and buy sandwiches while they did that, are all changing. I've talked to people at the top of the food chain in publishing, in bookselling, in all those areas, and nobody knows what the landscape will look like two years from now, let alone a decade away. The distribution channels that people had built over the last century or so are in flux for print, for visual artists, for musicians, for creative people of all kinds.

Which is, on the one hand, intimidating, and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're supposed to's of how you get your work seen, and what you do then, are breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen. YouTube and the web (and whatever comes after YouTube and the web) can give you more people watching than television ever did. The old rules are crumbling and nobody knows what the new rules are.

So make up your own rules.

Someone asked me recently how to do something she thought was going to be difficult, in this case recording an audio book, and I suggested she pretend that she was someone who could do it. Not pretend to do it, but pretend she was someone who could. She put up a notice to this effect on the studio wall, and she said it helped.

So be wise, because the world needs more wisdom, and if you cannot be wise, pretend to be someone who is wise, and then just behave like they would.

And now go, and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.

It’s a beautiful day here in Virginia, and I want to thank the University of Mary Washington for inviting me here.At a commencement address, speakers often go on too long. This I won’t do. I may not succeed as well as Salvador Dali, who famously delivered the world’s shortest speech, only four seconds long. He announced at the podium: “I will be so brief I have already finished.” and then sat down.

Commencement speakers also like to intone about “today’s youth generation.” And this is fine. Except that they then go on to talk at length about their own experiences in their own youth—and tell you: Because this worked for me in my generation, it will work for you in yours which should alert you that these speakers have no idea what a generation is.

Let me clarify. A generation is a group of people who share a basic outlook on life shaped by their common age location in history, their common “generational setting.” The renowned sociologist Karl Mannheim called this “eineGenerationslagerung,” which I promise you is both the longest word—and the only German word–that you will hear from me today.“Youth,” on the other hand, is just an age bracket. It’s like an empty hotel room that different generations move into—with their own baggage—and then soon leave. Sometimes that room swells with sweet music, sometimes it throbs with death metal, sometimes it’s utterly silent. But it’s never the same.

Bottom line: All of you Boomer and Generation X parents are essentially unlike your children—and were not the same even when you were kids. And you Millennial Generation graduates are essentially unlike your parents—and will not become like them as you grow older.

So how, exactly, are you different? Well, start with the obvious—pop culture: Believe it or not, parents, your kids have never known that America, Chicago, and Kansas are the names of rock bands, not just places. Or what about technology? Ever notice the blank stares when you tell them roll up the window, or turn the channel, or dial a number. Or what about current events? For as long as Millennials can remember, NATO has been looking for a mission, China has been peacefully rising, Brazil has been building shopping malls, and Boomers Bill O’Reilly and David Letterman have been hating on each other in the plain view of millions.

Now these markers are interesting. But if there’s one big I idea I want you to take away from my remarks, it’s that generational differences go much deeper.Consider.You Millennials grew up in an era of rising parental protection—never having known a time without bicycle helmets, electric plug covers, Amber Alerts, and 15 different ways to be buckled into your minivan seat. We, the parents, grew up in an era of declining parental protection: Our moms and dads told us, we don’t care where you go so long as you’re home for dinner—and as for seatbelts, we were told if there’s an accident to just put up our hands like this. As kids, we never saw a “Baby on Board” sticker. “Baby Overboard” would have been more appropriate.

You Millennials were raised to be special—very special—and trust your counselors, support groups, and smart drugs to keep you feeling pretty good about the world, like a Sims character having just the right digital balance. We, the parents, knew we weren’t very special, didn’t trust anyone to advise us, and thought staying away from counselors was a sign of resilience. When you came to college, there were long orientations and immersions–and many of your parents clutched teddy bears and wept. When we came to college, we jumped out of the car and tried to grab our suitcases before our parents sped off.

You Millennials were raised to be team players—which you are, with community service, group projects in the classroom, and clubs for everything. And, above all, with digital technology that connects you all to each other on Facebook, and smart phones that you go to bed with. We, the parents, were a lot more into competition, rebellion, and defying the mainstream. We did not “friend” each other. Our generation invented the “personal” computer. Personal, as in—mine and not yours, and certainly not part of the corporate mainframe our own parents bequeathed to us. Growing up, our biggest fear was that Big Brother might someday install cameras in our rooms. Our biggest joy was hearing Steve Jobs announce that “1984 won’t be like 1984.” And now our biggest surprise is to see our own kids connect with each other by installing their own cameras in their own rooms!

As a generation, you Millennials have a surprisingly conventional outlook on life. Surveys show that as you grow older you wish to become good citizens, good neighbors, well-rounded people who start families. Violent youth crime, teen pregnancy, and teen smoking have recently experienced dramatic declines. And for that we congratulate you.

Most startling of all, the values gap separating youth from their parents has virtually disappeared. You watch the same movies as your parents, buy the same brand-name clothing, talk over personal problems with them—and, yes, feel just fine about moving back in with them. When I travel around the country, I often ask people today in their 40s or 50s how many songs on their iPod overlap with what’s on their kids’ iPods. Typical answer: 30 or 40 percent. Let me tell you: Back in my days on campus (later known as “the days of rage”), we did not have iPods, but if we had, the overlap would have been absolutely zero. Everything about our youth culture was intentionally hostile and disrespectful of our parents. That was the whole idea.

Now people sometimes ask me: What does it mean that one generation is different from another—that Millennials, for example, are different from the Boomers or Gen-Xers who raised them? Does it mean that some generations are better than others?

And I say no: There is no such thing as a good or bad generation. Every generation is what it has to be—given the environment it encounters when it enters the world. And history shows that whatever collective personality that generation brings with it is usually what society needs at the time. As such, youth generations tend to correct for excesses of the midlife generation in power; and they tend to refill the social role being vacated by the elder generation who is disappearing.

To avoid speaking in code, let me rephrase this as follows: The Millennial Generation is correcting for the excesses of Boomers and Gen-Xers who today run America. I need not remind you what those excesses are: Leadership gridlock, refusal to compromise, rampant individualism, the tearing down of traditions, scorched-earth culture wars, and a pathological distrust of all institutions.

The Millennial Generation is also reprising many of the hallmarks of the original G.I. Generation, the “greatest generation,” who are now passing away. Like the Millennials, the G.I.s grew up as protected children and quickly turned into optimistic, consensus-minded team-players who saved our nation—in the dark days of the 1930s and ‘40s—from turning in the wrong direction at the wrong time.

Igor Stravinsky once wrote that every generation declares war on its parents and makes friends with its grandparents. Yet again that happens.

So all of you parents out there: Be proud of this new generation. They aren’t like you, but they are what America now needs. They don’t complain about the storm clouds looming over their fiscal, economic, and geopolitical future; they try to stay positive. They don’t want to bring the system down; they’re doing what they can to make it work again. They worry about you a lot. And they want to come together and build something big and lasting, something that will win your praise. Beneath their tolerant, optimistic, networking and risk-averse exterior lie attitudes and habits that may prove vital for our country’s healing and for our country’s future.

No one knows what challenges this Millennial Generation may eventually be asked to bear. Hardly anyone expects them to become America’s next “greatest generation.” But someday you can say you heard it from me: That is their destiny, to rescue this country from the mess to which we, the older generations, have contributed… perhaps a bit more than we ever intended—and in so doing to become a great generation indeed.

Thank you.

Don’t be frightened! When a Bennington student, 10 minutes before you come up to the podium hands you a mace, that he made,

If you don’t bring it to the podium with you, you will never be Bennington.

So I would like to thank you Ben for helping me put the fear of God in the audience tonight. But I have to put it down because I’m an actor, and I am really weak. That was heavy! It wasn’t like a prop. That shit was real!

Thanks Ben.

So now I’m going to read. And I’m not off book. So I might be looking down a lot.

Thank you, President Coleman, Brian Conover, faculty, students, family, alumni, some of whom are dear friends of mine who have travelled all the way from the big city to see me hopefully not humiliate myself tonight.

And especially thanks to you, the Graduating Class of 2012.

See, as a joke I wrote, hold for applause, and I was actually going to read that. So you kind of killed my joke!

Let’s do that again. 2012, hold for applause.

2012! Wow! I never thought I’d see 2012. I thought perhaps the Mayan calendar would prove correct. And the end of the world would have been the greatest excuse to get me out of this terrifying task of delivering the commencement speech. But wait! According to the Mayan calendar here, when does the world end? December — December 2012. Damn!

Okay. Maybe I shouldn’t talk to the graduates eager to start their new lives about the end of the world. Okay. Really? Really?

Of all the novelists, teachers, playwrights, poets, groundbreaking visual artists and pioneers of science, you got the TV actor. No, no, and I actually heard you petitioned for me. Oh, you fools!

You know what, for those of you who didn’t petition for me, I would love to later on talk about the problems in the Middle East and the downfall of the world economy. And for those of you who did petition for me, I don’t have any signed DVDs of the Game of Thrones. But I am happy to talk about the parallel lineages of the Targaryens and Lannisters later at the bar.

You see, it took all of my strength, and, of course, a little extra push from my wife Erica for me to agree to do this. Because I don’t do this. In my profession, I am told by people who know what they’re doing, where to stand, how to look, and most importantly, what to say. But you’ve got me — only me — my words unedited and as you will see quite embarrassing.

Okay, let me think.

I’m thinking. But actually I didn’t read that. That was ad libbed.

Let me think. What has — everyone and their uncle told me, as I desperately seek out advice on how to give a commencement address.

“Tell them what they want to hear.”

“Talk about your time at Bennington.”

“Know that there is no wrong speech.” I like that one.

“Just keep it brief.” That was my father-in-law.

“Be brutally honest. Tell them how hard it is after you graduate.” We’ll get back to that one.

“Just watch Meryl Streep’s commencement speech at Barnard and you’ll be fine.”

What did Beckett say: “I Can’t Go On, I’ll Go On”.

So even if I don’t burn in your hearts and minds long after this speech is over. Even if I don’t inspire you to reach for the stars and beyond. Even if I am erased from your memory after one glass of wine tonight — Where am I going with this? I can’t go on. I’ll go on.

You know, I won’t speak of my time here, like some old fishermen. You have already had your time here. You have your own story to tell.

But I have to say. For me, it did start here, in Vermont, on a very rainy night. It was 1987. And I was a prospective student. The rain was coming down so hard, it was impossible to see that I was meeting the person who would later become my greatest friend and collaborator. A freshman, who would, 17 years later, introduce me to the woman that became my wife. I’ll call him Sherm. Because I do.

It was late at night, on the road, right there near Booth House. And despite the dark night and the heavy rain, this place was so alive. The lights pulsed from each of the dorms.

Now I was a kid from New Jersey who went to an all-boys catholic high school. I was four-foot something. I mumbled when I spoke. I wore a sort of woman’s black velvet cape, black tights, combat boots and a scowl.

But here at Bennington, I was home. And I have to say it doesn’t get better. Let me clarify. There are not shinier more important people out there. Your fellow students, you friends sitting around you are as good as it gets. Twenty two years after my own graduation, I have worked with my rainy night friend and fellow graduate Sherm on countless productions he has written, in all stages of development from living rooms to off-Broadway.

Brooks, Ian, Justin, Brett, John, Matthew, Jim, Sean, Hyla, Nicki and The B are all classmates I shared my time with here and still work with, and am lucky to call my friends. We are very spoiled here. People always say to me, “for such a small school it seems like there are so many of you”. I find that really interesting. And I kind of think that’s perfect. We can’t help it. We burn very brightly. Please don’t ever stop.

Graduates, now when I sat where you are right sitting right now, I had so many dreams of where I wanted to go, who I wanted to be, and what I wanted to do. Theater companies I wanted to start with classmates. Movies, I wanted to be in. Directors I wanted to work with. Stories I needed to tell. It might take a little time, I thought. But it would happen. When I sat there, 22 years ago, what I didn’t want to think about is where I would be tomorrow. What I would have to start to do tomorrow.

And I graduated in 1991, a great year. A time of resurgence for independent films in this country. A time of relatively affordable rents in New York City. See, I assumed that I could make a living writing my plays, acting way off off off Broadway. And hopefully, you know, one day, join the actors I loved and respected in those independent films. TV – oh, what, no. What! Are you kidding me? No, didn’t even consider that. I had much more class than that. Much more self-respect than that. And so bothers —

What I didn’t have was cash, a bank account, a credit card, or an apartment. I just had debt. A big hungry, growing larger every moment debt.

So as you will tomorrow, I had to leave beautiful Vermont. Attack the life that I knew with socks and a tooth brush into my backpack. And I slept on ouch, after couch, after couch, after couch at friends’ apartments in New York. Until I wore out the rent paying roommates’ welcome.

I didn’t want a day job. I was an actor, I was a writer. I was a Bennington graduate. I had to get a day job. I dusted pianos at a piano store and let those streak for five months. I worked on the property of a Shakespeare scholar for a year pulling weeds and removing bees’ nests. I went on unemployment once but for not for long, I couldn’t handle the guilt.

Eventually I was able to pay rent for a spot on the floor of an apartment on the Lower East side. But my roommate had a breakdown and disappeared. He later resurfaced in a religious cult. I’m making this sound romantic. It really wasn’t.

I helped hang paintings at galleries, paintings that inspire you to think, I could do that.

And then finally, after two years of job and couch surfing, I got a job in application processing. As a data enterer at a place called Professional Examination Services. And I stayed for six years. Six years! Longer than my time at Bennington.

From the age of 23 to 29, well they loved me there. I was funny. I wore black no cap no tights. I smoked in the loading docks with the guys from the mail room and we shared how hung-over we all were. Everyone called each other shortie. What’s up short? How you doing shortie? So how so hung-over shortie?

I called in sick almost every Friday because I was out late the night before. I hated that job. And I clung to that job. Because of that job, I could afford my own place.

So I lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Yeah, you say that now. Oh, my kingdom for a time machine. Yeah, that’s right. I lived in an industrial loft. My rent was $400 a month.

My dream of running a theater company with my friend and fellow Bennington graduate, Ian bell had died. I won’t go into those details but neither one of us had any business sense and the theater we lived in. It had no heat or hot water. We didn’t smell very good. But we had our youth, but youth gets old very quickly. You’ll see.

So Ian moved out to Seattle. And I moved up the street to my loft. And I still didn’t have heat.

In 1993, industrial loft meant not legal to live there. See, I don’t want this to sound cool and I feel like it’s sounding cool. Ad lib.

But I did have hot water — hot water in my bathroom, which a friend of mine using that bathroom once shouted, it smells exactly like. A summer camp in here. It was true. For some reason, in the middle of Brooklyn, there was earth in my shower – actual earth and then oh, look, mushrooms growing from the earth. But I was safe though.

The ideal fire control company was right across the street where they make all the chemicals that put out chemical fires. I did not fear a chemical fire. I would be OK. And all those chemicals in the air were OK too. Because up the street we had the spice factory, they made spices, and that just covered everything up in a nice cumin scent. I had a rat. But that was OK, because I got a cat. His name was Brian, no relation.

My grandmother had given me a pink pull-out couch. Oddly no friends or recent graduates wanted to crash on my couch. So I put the couch on its end, so Brian could climb it and look out the window.

I had only the one window. I myself could not look out the window. It was – it was quite high. So I had no heat. No girlfriend. What! Are you kidding me? No, acting agent. But I had a cat named Brian who told me of the world outside. And I stayed for 10 years. No, don’t pity me. There’s a happy ending.

When I was 29, I told myself the next acting job I get no matter what it pays, I will from now on, for better or worse, be a working actor. So I quit my position at the Professional Examination Services. My friends really weren’t happy about that, because it was so easy to find me when I worked there. Work – that was the only place I had the internet. This was at the beginning of the Internet.

And now I didn’t have either the internet or a cell phone or a job. But something good happened.

I got a little pink theater job in a play called Imperfect Love. Which led to a film called 13 Moons with the same writer. Which led to other roles. Which led to other roles. And I’ve worked as an actor ever since.

But I didn’t know that would happen. At 29, walking away from data processing, I was terrified.

Ten years in a place without heat. Six years at a job, I felt stuck in. Maybe I was afraid of change. Are you?

My parents didn’t have much money. But they struggled to send me to the best schools. And one of the most important things they did for me — and graduates, maybe you don’t want to hear this – is that once I graduated, I was on my own. Financially, it was my turn.

Parents are applauding, graduates are not. But this made me very hungry. Literally. I couldn’t be lazy. Now I’m totally lazy but back then, I couldn’t be.

And so at 29, in a very long last, I was in the company of the actors and writers and directors I’d start out that first year, that first day after school. I was. I am by their sides.

Raise the rest of your life to meet you. Don’t search for defining moments because they will never come. Well, the birth of your children, OK, of course, forget about it, that’s just six months. My life is forever changed, that’s most defining moment ever. But I’m talking about in the rest of your life and most importantly in your work. The moments that define you have already happened. And they will already happen again. And it passes so quickly.

So please bring each other along with you. Everyone you need is in this room. These are the shiny more important people.

Sorry, it sucks after graduation. It really does. I mean, I don’t know. At least it did for me. But that’s the only thing I know.

You just get a bit derailed. But soon something starts to happen. Trust me. A rhythm sets in. Just like it did after your first few days here. Just try not to wait until like me, you’re 29 before you find it. And if you are, that’s fine too. Some of us never find it. But you will, I promise you. You are already here. That’s such an enormous step all its own. You’ll find your rhythm, or continue the one you have already found.

I was walking downtown in Manhattan the other day. And I was approached by a group of very sweet young ladies. Easy. Actually they’re sort of running feverishly down the street after me. When they got to me breathless, it was really — they didn’t know what to say, or couldn’t form the words. But it came out that they were NYU freshmen. And they were majoring in musical theater. Of course, come on. They were like science majors. They are running after me.

“What musicals are you doing?” I inquired.

“Well,” one of them said, looking down at her shoes, “we aren’t allowed to be in plays in our freshman year”.

Now they were paying a very high tuition to not do what they love doing.

I think I said, “Well, hang in there”. What I should have said was, “Don’t wait until they tell you you are ready. Get in there”. Sing or quickly transfer to Bennington.

When I went to school here, if a freshman wanted to write direct and star in her own musical, the lights would already be hung for her.

Now I tell the story, because the world might say you are not allowed to yet. I waited a long time out in the world before I gave myself permission to fail. Please, don’t even bother asking, don’t bother telling the world you are ready. Show it. Do it.

What did Beckett say? “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.”

Bennington Class of 2012, the world is yours. Treat everyone kindly and light up the night.

Thank you so much for having me here.

Thank you for that introduction, President Marcy. I thank you Chairman Golding and all the members of the Board. I especially want to thank all the students that are here today. Congratulations. It’s appropriate to be here in the Bay Area near the beating heart of so much of America’s innovation and creative thinking, near the birthplace of think different.

I’m reminded so often how rare and precious different thinking is. I remember on the flight over just yesterday I sat next to an older lady named Judith. I was working on some high level state department business, okay I was tweeting, when the flight attendant came by to say, in that tone that flight attendants clearly learn at some specialized flight attendant school, “Sir, we’re going to need you to shut off that phone.” Like any red blooded American I, of course, pretended to turn it off and kept typing. This isn’t Soviet Russia, that rule makes absolutely no sense. If electronics were dangerous al-Qaeda would just send people out with iPads and personal shavers.

This displeased my seatmate Judith greatly. “They told us to turn that off.” she said. I ignored her. She tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention and pointed to the offending device. I asked why she felt so strongly about enforcing the rule. She said she hadn’t followed any of the literature I told her about on there being no reason to turn off cell phones on planes. I countered that this rule had been abandoned in other parts of the world, that it was dumb nonsense, that if it were dangerous during takeoff and landing surely we wouldn’t be able to use the phones while we were hurtling through the air at 30000 feet, sorryI just feel passionate about this.

I don’t need explanations, it’s a rule. My generation followed those. She shook her head, not like you young people. I peered at Judith and wondered if she remembered the civil rights movement, Vietnam, if she was really well preserved maybe women’s suffrage. Judith is right. Young people stand for a specific set of qualities, we’re impatient, we’re unfocused, we take risks, we are brash, and we’re disobedient. Sometimes we act like the rules don’t apply to us because we can be, let’s face it, the little self-absorbed.

TodayI want to take a moment to talk about why those youthful qualities are in fact a great strength. Why your rule breaking, risk taking, disobedient selves are exactly what we need for all of our world’s challenges and exactly what you need as you embark on this next step of your journey.

Aristotle wrote more than 2300 years ago that quote “The young are heated by nature as drunken men by wine.” Only recently have we understood how true this is. Imaging studies of the young brain showed it undergoes a massive reorganization between ages 12 and 25. That faint buzzing you’re hearing isn’t mic feedback; it’s your brains rewiring themselves. These physical changes move in a wave from the brain’s rear to its front.Making our most heavily used synapsis, the little chemical junctures across which axons and dendrites pass notes, stronger. At the same time the synapsis that we don’t use gradually withers. That means in a few years you’ll become more focused, more risk averse, and more likely to follow familiar rules and patterns.

Scientists once thought that the young brain, in all its recklessness, was a work in progress, an intermediary state. The recent neurological studies have cast amore flattering light on our recklessness. The current literature shows that the person under 25 is less a rough draft than a finely honed instrument, tailor made for one of life’s greatest periods of challenge and change. The journey you are all embarking on now, entering the real world, finding your passions, laying the groundwork to build your family, is among the most important tests we undergo as a species. That’s why evolution gave us our reckless brains. The trail blazing qualities of youth provide us with an unmatched power to accept change, challenge norms and adapt to all of those new environments that you’re about to face. So Judith and your next boss, indeed the world may not like your instincts but they’re the best tools you will still have at your disposal to build your future and a better future for all of us.

That’s exactly what we’ve seen young people do in recent years. One of the great privileges of my work has been to learn from young people living amidst extraordinary pressures and conflicts. In Sudan with the U.N., I spoke with teenagers in refugee camps and rebel held areas across Africa. I met people like the child soldier who was 17, my own age at the time, when I met him. He had been fighting with the rebel group, the Sudanese liberation army since he was 13. He told me how early one morning he’d been awakened by the sound of gunfire. The government-backed militias that carried out a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign in Darfur had surrounded his village. On camels and horse backs they swept through, killing men, raping women and setting fire to homes.He was waving a gun at the sky when I met him decrying an opposing rebel faction. He told me “This is the way I have to be heard. This is the way I have to end this conflict.”

The exciting thing is, although I’ve heard that message echoed all around the world from young people who’ve taken up arms to make a difference and I’ve realized that whatever the tools, our generation we’ll find a way to make a difference. We now know that the tools are changing. We’re seeing young people turning to peaceful methods reform. We seeing them make their voices heard in the blogosphere, on Facebook, and on twitter. Some of them even follow me on Twitter and we like those people very much. Anything goes.

I think of a young Tunisian I met, a21-year-old, when I think of the way in which revolutions can be not only powerful but also a peaceful. He recorded a song in his garage called “Mr.President.” It is addressed to thenTunisian president,Ben Ali. He sang that the Tunisian people were living like dogs, drinking from a cup of suffering, how they were unable to work and how their voices were not being heard. The song became an instant Youtube and Facebook hit, an anthem for frustrated young Tunisians. It wasn’t long before the secret police burst into his family’s home. They hauled him to government facility where he spent three days in a solitary cell being interrogated. His captors demanded, “Who’s behind you? Which party you are you from?” He didn’t belong to a political party. He wasn’t writing his songs on behalf of an opposition leader. He represented a new political force, one that the police that interrogated him didn’t yet understand, youth. He, and young men and women like him, in every country in the world belong to a generation that more and more is shaping the political events of our time.

Protests by young Tunisians sent a seismic wave racing across this region from Tunisia to Cairo to Baghdad to Tripoli. Young men and women who had been marginalized stood up and stood strong for their dignity, the opportunity to build their own futures and the right to have a voice in their own governments. They marched, they chanted, they organized and their countries arrested, beat and even killed.

Of course, young people where are not alone in these experiences. Tahrir square brought together people of all ages, so has our own occupy Wall Street movement in the United States. Political expression isn’t a young person’s game. It is a fundamental human experience but it is youthful qualities, a resistance to rules for their own sake, fearlessness in challenging norms, a willingness to accept risk and uncertainty, those same qualities that will carry you through this next period of change in your lives that have animated these changes around the world. When I look at this crowd, I’m excited because I see those same qualities right here on this campus.

I think of people like Sarah Moson, who fled conflict in Baghdad to come here, who built an initiative to link Bay Area veterans and Iraqis for public service or Theo Newman who shouldered a full course load and a job as a caretaker for the elderly and still found time to start up her own software development company.

There are many here just like them, who don’t wait to tackle the problems they see with drive and creativity. When that means a high likelihood to be a failure, you know to embrace the risk and carry forward anyway. Those ultimately are the qualities of youth thatI hope I don’t lose and that I hope you won’t either.

So why does this all matter to you? First, because each and every one of us faces the same unforgiving future and confronting it will take all of our original thinking and willingness to buck old norms. Young people have been hit harder by the economic crisis than almost any other demographic. The unemployment rate for young Americans averages twice the rate for all other workers. At last count, some 17 percent of Americans,16 to 24, are out of work. In the degree you received today you have a tremendous advantage in facing that moment of crisis but the market you enter remains a bleak one.

That means that many of you may have to build your own solutions, new start-ups created by entrepreneurs create a majority of new jobs. Many of the global brands, in fact that started right here in California, were just creative ideas from young people started on campuses like this one. Carrying forward that spirit of entrepreneurship means drawing on each of our so-called flaws. Let me touch on three.

First sometimes it’s your willingness to accept risk and uncertainty and yes at times our blissful ignorance of just how much can go wrong that can turn our obstacles into opportunities. It’s telling that more than half of all fortune five hundred companies were founded during recessions or bare markets and that so many of the founders of those companies were young people frustrated with economies just like this one. We may fail but we have a plenty of time to try it again and again until we succeed. We may screw up but we will learn from our mistakes. We may piss people off but sometimes that’s what you have to do to shake things up.

Second, don’t be afraid to be impatient. The entrepreneurs whose ideas have driven the world’s economy are those who refused to wait for established businesses to come around to their way of thinking.Individuals driving youth to the forefront of the global stage are young activists who wouldn’t wait for their rights to be honored.

Finally, for those of you sitting here wondering what the hell the next phase of your life will be about, know that diversity can be among your greatest strengths. I remember when my sister Quincy was five; she wanted to be a doctor, a mermaid, a ballerina, and a man. She’s still got some work to do on a few of those things. That continues to be my philosophy. Don’t ever feel boxed into a single career or pursuit. Remain curious. Explore every access on every front in the battle to make a difference. There are plenty of years for us to be stuck in our ways, to lose our elasticity, to grow soft and a little jaded. Put it off as long as possible. Fight that sense of what can’t happen, of accepting what has always been, what’s broken, what’s less than you can achieve and less than this world can be. Own those qualities of youthful recklessness.They give us the power to achieve incredible things whether in our careers, in public service, in our communities or around the world.

The fact is, you may not need to revolt against an oppressive dictatorial regime unless you battle Obama’s socialist thing, but every day all of us young and old are challenged limit, by expectations, boundaries and bigotry and confronting those forces will take willingness on our part to make waves. Breakdown old standards and make some of our elders uncomfortable. We’d better do it. We have to.

Through no fault of our own our generation inherits a set of challenges, from pandemic disease, a changing climate, a dependence on fossil fuels like oil, a world threatened by the spread of dangerous tools of destruction and society’s in every corner of our planet driven by religious and tribal divides.

The bottom line is the previous generations have failed to solve a lot of these problems and in many cases they’ve made them worse. I think it’s going to be young people like you that break through the stale thinking and old divisions that have prevented progress for so long.

I’m here to tell you to keep trail blazing. Keep taking risks, not just because you’ll need to, but also because the world will need you to. That’s true of young people in this country and it’s true of this country itself. It’s often said that part of America’s success has been the fact that we’re new nation that we don’t have a history and so we’re not bound by it and that we have the audacity to believe that things can be different.

I hope that you’ll carry forward that knowledge as you embark on this next journey. While I’m not the oldest or wisest of commencement speakers in the Bay Area today, I’m armed with something and you each are armed with something that will allow us to confront this moment of challenged and turmoil better than anyone. I hope you’ll understand the power you have to change our lives change the world. Congratulations class of 2012.

This is really a surreal, deep honor to be here for a whole set of reasons. As was introduced, MIT has obviously played a big role in my own life and I think a much deeper role than many of ya’ll might appreciate.

Some of you might remember that in the late nineties when the first internet boom was happening, there was a lot of talk about online education. And most of the talk back then about online education, actually not too different from now, was either about how to profit from it, how to make money off of it, OR as some institutions were thinking, about how to defend against it or at least sit on the sidelines and see how everything played out. And all of a sudden MIT jumped into the mix in 2001, and announced MIT OpenCourseWare ­­— that it was going to take knowledge and resources that used to be behind the walls of elite institutions and not charge for them but give them away for free to the world. And instead of saying “how can we profit off of this?” MIT said, well there are some things that are higher than that.

There are some things that if we can empower in an unlimited number of people for all of time, that’s something that we would be willing to spend resources on. And when that happened, I was just a couple years out of college, working at a tech company in San Francisco, I had no idea that my own career adventure would lead to what I’m doing now, but when I read that press release, I had never been so inspired; I had never felt so proud to come from this community. And frankly just a couple years later when it became clear that the videos I had made for my cousins were not only being watched by my cousins, there was talk of, “Well, this could be a business.”

I was in Silicon valley, and this is what it was all about. I worked for a hedge fund, a very for profit organization, but it was the memory of how I felt the first time I read that press release about what OpenCourseWare had become that really gave me the clarity to understand what Khan academy could be. It could be this institution that could reach everyone and transcend ideas of profits and businesses. And I say this not just to show the connection it had for Khan Academy, but there’s also a kind of meta-level idea here. These days you hear a lot of universities and institutions talk about teaching and instilling ethics and morality, taking classes on it, telling you to read about it, but MIT actually did it. MIT actually lived by its actions, it actually put principle over profit. And it’s continuing to do it, with MITx, now with EdX in concert with Harvard. It’s continuing to push the envelope, and I’m just in awe. It feels like we’re living in a science fiction book of what might happen in education in the next few years.

But my connections to MIT go even deeper than that. Obviously I went here, but my wife also graduated from MIT, class of 2001. The president of Khan academy, and chief operating officer, was my roommate freshman year at Next House (room 343 for the two or three of you that might have shared that room at some point). One of our board members went to MIT, and his wife went to MIT. And I’m just starting; that’s a small sample of all the people we know at MIT, but maybe even more surprising is that of the people we know from MIT now, 90% of them are married to each other.

Anytime you have this type of love come from one place, I think one should introspect, as romantic as the infinite corridor may be. And you know I’ve seen such extreme coupling here that I’ve suspected this whole place might be a front for some type of DARPA-funded breeding project (someone knows what’s going on up here).

But there are simpler explanations, and I think the most obvious one, and at least the one most clear to me, is that the admissions office here, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, seems to have a somewhat unhealthy bias for only admitting extremely attractive people (you’re welcome, thought that would go over well).

But I think it goes even deeper than that. As long as I can remember, I’ve told anyone who would listen to me that MIT is the closest thing on this planet Earth to Hogwarts, to Harry Potter’s wizarding school. The ideas and research and the science that percolate behind these walls — that’s the closest thing to magic in the real world, and frankly, to people outside this campus it looks like magic. The faculty we have here are the leading wizards of our time, the Dumbledores and McGonagalls (I guess, President Hockfield, you would be McGonagall). The halls here have secret passages and tunnels, and around every corner there are strange and bizarre magical objects and creatures, some of whom may finish their thesis this decade.

When we’re in Killian court, it’s almost a shrine when you look at the names around us. You see Newton and Darwin and Gallileo and Archimedes and these are the great wizards of history. They remind us that we have inherited an ancient tradition, an ancient art that for much of history and even today to some degree, has been sometimes vilified or suppressed by forces of ignorance. Yet, despite that, it has always shone through and has been, at least in my mind, the prime cause of human advancement.

The people who come here, the students who come here, you, there’s these young people all over the world from every walk of life who are all off the charts in some special way for this kind of magic that goes on here. Some come from affluent, rich, educated families; some of you come from poor families where you’re the first to get a college degree; some come from environments where their gifts are really celebrated; some come from environments where frankly most for of their life, they had to hide their passions, their gifts, for fear of looking different. But they come here, suspecting that this might be a place where they can spread their wings: where they can explore the world, where they can finally look with clarity at the mysteries of the universe, at the magic of everything that surrounds us.

MIT, I think, delivers on that. It opens our minds to what’s possible and even more uniquely, it pushes us. I do believe that MIT pushes us harder than probably any other institution in the world. But when you do that, you take someone to another level, you make them truly recognize what they’re capable of.

And I think that there’s another side-effect owing to why there’s so much love here. When you have people, regardless of what they look like superficially, where they come from, they have that same core desire to understand the universe; they all have that same core desire to push humanity forward. You bring them all together to a community like this, and then you push them, in frankly, a very intense environment. You cry together, you laugh together, you procrastinate together, you have sleepless nights together, you wander the halls together. It creates the deepest possible bond. It’s like people who have fought in wars together; they have a shared experience that other people might not understand or even comprehend.

And because of that, for the rest of your life, you will feel connected to other MIT people. You’ll want to be around them and you’ll seek them out. And if you’re in kind of a mixed group of people and you hear someone not from MIT talk about how impossible something is, how hard something is, how difficult something is, you’ll seek out the other MIT person in the room and catch a glance and you’ll both share a little smirk. And while you’re doing that smirk, if they are your preferred gender, you might see a certain twinkle in their eye and realize that you are irresistibly attracted to them.

So coming here, it really feels like I’ve come to a family, a family that I’m deeply connected to, a family that I truly love, and I hope to just give you some appreciation for the potential you guys are about to leave with. And when I said that 14 years ago at my commencement, you know it was kind of an idea on paper, but now I’ve seen what my peers in my class above and below me have done and it’s really been nothing short of amazing.

And with that, I want to give you a sense of internal strength and happiness, and not just because I care about you and I want you to be happy person, but because I believe in order for you to really reach your potential, you really have to be centered and really have a place to go when things get a little bit tough. And you should take all of this with a grain of salt, I’m not a lot older than most of you; view me as your older brother or cousin or whatever. What I’m about to say, these are things I still try to live by, but I’m at least as imperfect as any of you guys; these are things that when I have been able to do it, I’ve found work quite well.

The first is to be just as incredibly or maybe even as delusionally positive as possible. It’s a very cynical place out there sometimes and that cynicism will eat at your energy and your potential. And to fight it, you should smile with every atom in your body, you should smile first thing in the morning, you should even, this is something that I actually do if I’m in a bad mood, force yourself to smile. It releases things in your brain. You should smile with your eyes, your mouth, your face, your body, at every living and non-living thing that you see. You should recognize that the grass is greener on your side of the fence and even in the 1% chance that it’s not, just convincing yourself that it’s greener will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you find yourself, in your life, in an argument with someone whom you respect, whom you care deeply about, it’s not an easy thing to do, but try to surrender your ego to the shared identity of the relationship that you have with that person. If possible, do exactly the opposite of what your pride and ego tell you in the heat of battle. And if you have the strength to do it, right when you’re about to get in that last word and you’re about to say that kind of maybe vindictive or below the belt thing, just pause, don’t do anything, and try to just give them a super-mega hug.

Recognize that material loss or gain will all happen, but when it happens be upset a little bit or be happy a little bit, but keep it all in perspective. They’re all silly relative to the things that matter: your health and your relationships. As much as possible, try to make people feel like you’re listening to them. And I have a secret here, the best way to make people feel that you’re listening to them is to listen to them.

When you’re stressed, and there will be times of stress in your life, just look up at the night sky and imagine the scale of the universe, the age of the universe, the distance to the next star, the other sentient creatures on other M-class planets who are also looking at the night sky. Think about that shared experience and the civilizations that have come on by. It’ll put your problems in a little bit of perspective. If you can take a walk through the woods, forget your name, your identity, your ambitions, and just for a little bit, for a moment, realize what you are, just another animal walking through the woods, another mammal. Recognize that you’re not quite sure why you’re here, but you enjoy the ride and you love the mystery of everything that’s around you and you want to explore it more.

As much as possible, and this is something that’s difficult and not something I do anywhere near perfectly, but I try, is to build true empathy for everyone. And a thought experiment I do often to get me in that frame of mind, it’s just a thought experiment regardless of your actual spiritual beliefs, is to imagine that time isn’t a one way street, that you can go back in time, etc etc. And in your next life, you could go back in time and be reincarnated as anyone, and you literally could be everyone in this room. And with that little mental framework in place, imagine that in your next life, you could go back in time and be that person you’re having the conversation with right now, that person that you’re arguing with right now, or the person that you’re passing judgement on right now. And if that is the case, that in your next life, you will have to put up with the current self-righteous version of yourself.

And so I want to bring it all together with another thought experiment that I like to do that helps me at least focus on where I want to put my energies.

Imagine yourself in 50 years. You’re in your early 70s, near the end of your career (we have a few models here if you have trouble visualizing that). You’re sitting on your couch. 2062, and you’ve just finished watching the State of the Union holograph by president Kardashian.

And you start to reflect on your life. You start to think of all your successes, your career successes, your family successes, the great memories that you’ve had. But then you start to think about all of the things you wished you had done just a little differently, your regrets. I can imagine what they might be.

You wish you had spent more time with your children, you’ll wish that you had told your spouse how much you loved them more frequently, you’ll wish you could have spent more time and told your parents how much you appreciated them before they passed away. And just while that’s happening, a genie appears.

The genie says, “Well, I’ve been listening in on your regrets, and you seem like a good person. I’m willing to give you a second chance if you are open to it.” And so you say sure, and the genie snaps his fingers and you blink your eyes and when you open them you find yourself right there right where you are right now, June 8th 2012, Killian Court. Some crazy guy is giving a commencement speech. And you say “Oh my god, I’m in my 20-something fit, pain-free body again! I’m around my peers again, and the genie was serious! I can have a second chance, I can have all of the successes, all of the adventures I had the first time around, but now I can optimize things. Now when I see my classmates and I give them that hug at commencement, I can hug them a little bit harder, I can show them how much I care about them. Now that my parents are back, I can finally tell them how much I appreciate them. I can finally give them more hugs, more time. I can do everything more; I can laugh more, I can sing more, I can dance more, I can be more of a source of positivity for people around me and empower more people.

And so here I am, truly honored to be your commencement speaker, just in awe of the potential that’s here, the potential in this time that we’re in. The positive revolutions are not going to be caused by generals and politicians; they are going to be caused by innovators like you. And in this time, seeing you, the wizards of tomorrow, I’m just excited by what you’re going to do with your second pass.

Good morning. I am so honored to be a part of the class of 2012 and I once set where you are sitting today so I know that there are a bunch people who just rolled in from last night. I know there are others who have been preparing for this day since the moment they walked onto this campus. I know that for everybody this is a culmination of years of hard work.

Today you’re surrounded by people who love and support you, the people got you here.They are your brothers and your sisters and your parents and your grandparents, your fans who’ve sacrificed and whose constant belief in you has helped you to achieve.To the parents especially, I know you’re looking down at the sea of graduates and you see your baby who is about to fly out of the nest and into the real world.

I have four small children so I know what the anticipation of this very moment is like. To put some of your fears to rest a little bit, they’re not leaving. I don’t just mean that metaphorically, quite literally they’re not leaving. We talk about the boomerang generation; these independent young people are moving back in with you. Even if they have jobs, the food is better, it’s not as expensive, they can borrow a car…They are moving back home with you.

I know for sure, if it doesn’t happen this year and doesn’t happen next year it will happen the year after. The year that I moved out of my parents’ home, after I left school, my parents knocked down the wall that separated their bedroom. They expanded their bedroom. I had no room. I still came back, twice. They’re not leaving.

To the graduates, today I think is a bittersweet day.I can see some of you wistfully looking around at campus where you’ve sort of grown-up, where you’ve become men and women, where you’ve developed deep friendships and strong bonds. For some of you, you’re worried that you might lose a strong connection to your alma mater starting today because your graduation will mean saying goodbye to all you’ve known here at the university. 

So let me put those fears to rest. This university will be part of your life forever. The Alumni Association will hunt you down. They will find you. Literally you can join the Peace Corps and be working in the Congo and they will get a letter to you about how your membership in the Association of Alumni has not gone through and they’re sure the check is on the way.

You might be working as an investment banker 120 hours a week, at a top-tier investment bank working as an analyst, so busy that your own mother has given up on trying to reach you. They will find you. They will track you down. 

It’s graduation we also know how close to work time to stand up here and give lots of advice. You will all dutifully nod your head since, I know President Harker said he’s the one standing between you and graduation, but really it’s me and you’re going to not your heads and listen. There’s one thing that’s a little problematic which is I don’t give advice.

Many years ago Woman’s Magazine actually asked me for the best advice my mother ever gave me.My mother is an immigrant to this country, very tough nut mom verses the warm and fuzzy mom and I told them that this was a really bad idea, no thank you.

They said no, we’re going to do a Mother’s Day spread, you and your mom hugging in the paper. It’ll be great, best advice your mother gave you. My mother’s best advice was “Most people are idiots.” I said that to the editor and she said, “We’ll call you back.” and I never heard from them again. 

So you can see why really don’t give advice. Actually my mother’s advice is very true, graduates, and when you leave here you will be told in many varied ways over many years, of all the things that you cannot do, what you cannot achieve and you will absolutely positively fail in. People will say you cannot get a job in a down economy. People will say you cannot get a job that you love that will pay you well. People will say you can’t do good and do well. They’re wrong, that’s idiotic advice. People will tell you that you cannot change the world. They’re wrong too.
 
Let’s agree to agree that we’re going to ignore all the idiots today. My parents in a lot of ways were my role models in not listening. They really spent their lives ignoring people. They were dating as a mixed-race couple at a time when interracial dating was frowned upon. ‘Frowned upon’ what does that mean exactly? My mother said it meant you could be shot.

My parents came to America for an education and my mother who’s black and Cuban and my father was white and Australian met in 1958 because they used to go to the daily mass together. They were both in graduate school too. My dad drove but my mother didn’t have a car and so my father every single day would stop his car and wind down the window, and every day he would offer a ride and everyday my mother would say “No thank you.” because you don’t take a ride from someone you don’t know well. 

Then one day she said yes and they made a date to go on a date but because it was 1958 in Baltimore, Maryland, a place where interracial dating that gets you killed, literally, every single restaurant they went to would not seat them together they said to my father “You can come in.” but to my mother they said “No and certainly not together.” Eventually my mother brought my father back to her apartment and made him dinner because she’s an amazing cook of Cuban food that’s fabulous.My mother’s point in telling this story to her four daughters was “See girls, if you can cook, you can get a man.”

My parents married at the end of 1958 when interracial marriage was illegal in the state of Maryland and16 other states and they drove to WashingtonD.C. where marriage between different race couples was legal and got hitched and drove back and lived illegally as a couple. When their friends said to them whatever you do, don’t have kids because biracial children will never find a place in this world, I’m number five of six. My parents were terrible listeners every step of the way.

Some advice is just idiotic. My parents knew that they were on the right side of history and they never listened to how other people in the nation lived their lives and they knew that history would catch up to them. In1967, by the time my little brother was born, the sixth child, the Supreme Court would overturn the ban on interracial marriage and my mother would tell me stories about how she walked down the street with my father and her biracial children and people would spit on us.

I asked her how she handled that. How did you deal with people saying to your face, “disgusting.” and she would say, “We knew America was better than that.” She stopped taking advice.

I became a reporter because I wanted to tell stories about people, kind of like my mother and father, regular people.I wanted to ask tough questions and understand people’s lives and their perspectives and I think sometimes people think my job is about interviewing famous people or political pundits. It is not.

I see my job as trying to understand people, the lives they lived, the choices they’ve made, their dreams, their goals, their hopes, their fears, that is what I do but I started reporting documentaries like Black in America and LatinoIn America and Muslim in America. Literally people would give me the advice; nobody cares about the voices of people who will not be in the history books.

Idid a documentary on coal miners in WestVirginia and female rescue workers at ground zero, documentaries on post KatrinaNew Orleans and Haiti. I ignored the advice and what I learned was a very important lesson. We have a shared humanity. We all want the same things. People would say to me, “Why would you talk about a subset of people?” Whether it’s Muslims, African Americans or coal miners, for me, I discovered by telling their stories, by telling our stories, by giving a voice to their history by digging into their conversations, I could reveal more to the rest of America to get perspective so people would understand individuals better.

I could help people peer through the walls so we could see at the end of the day, we are all actually very much the same. If we start with the understanding that our dream is everybody’s dream we better understand that we are just part of a bigger whole.Not divided by political labels or gender or race or class or religion but made stronger as a nation because of what binds us in spite of those differences. It’s why heritage and identity matters and we can all be proud that we are here. To get there those differences can be explored and celebrated and examined and argued.

Understanding people, by hearing their stories that you’ve never heard before, is the first step to building bridges over those walls. “America is greater than that.” said my mother and she was right. This is the best thing about my job and as you commence, graduates, into a new beginning it can be the thing about this new phase of life.

My best and most important stories come from people whose names you’ll never remember because they’re stories of the American dream. Regardless of the job you’re starting with, the next step that you’re taking, you too can work to understand people where they are. You think because you’re leaving here you’re done with the learning let me assure you that you are not.

You’ve succeeded in learning how to learn and to make a life not just a living but a life requires learning what it means to be responsible to other people. When I sat where you’re sitting I wanted to know the following things. Will I have a job? Will I have a career? AmI going to be successful? Those were really the wrong questions.

AsI said, you don’t need advice, except maybe the advice of don’t listen to stupid advice. Do seek out and listen to other people. Try to hear them.I have made a career of that and it has been rewarding mostly because when you seek to listen you can make a huge impact.

Remember, even as you calculate your student loan debt and your first apartment debt your real debt is the people around you, your fellow man and how do we seek to understand each other, our differences and our similarities because until we do that we’re never going to make the world a better place.

Last week I was in Haiti.I was working as a volunteer at an orphanage. The orphanage was the focus of the documentary I did in the wake of Haiti’s terrible earthquake. I remember tent cities would pop up overnight, literally, with 20000 people. The next morning when you woke up there were 40000 people and trucks would sometimes roll by full of bodies.

It was the picture of horror at times and yet the place had moments of humanity and hope even in the moments after that earthquake. One morning I got up and in front of the tent city all these women had made brooms and they were sweeping the front of their tent city. Their message was we are human beings too.

I was going to tell the story of missionaries who are working to save some of the 450000 Haitian orphans in one orphanage. After wandering around the grounds for a little while I opened up the back of a box truck and inside were 25 infants. That’s where they were keeping them because there is no place to house them and because they would feed of the sort of milk and rice mash which babies cannot tolerate they would get sicker. There was this vicious cycle happening because they would get dehydrated and the only thing they had to give them was the mash

I said to the missionary, “How do you do this? How do you continue to work when there is no light at the end of the tunnel? How do you try to save lives and change with so much sadness and sometimes failure around you like it looks impossible from where I’m standing, honestly? I don’t know how you are doing it.” She said to me “Really, it’s about the star fish story. A boy is walking along the beach, the tides gone out and all these starfish, millions of starfish, had been beached and so he starts picking up starfish and chucking them back into the ocean one-at-a-time. A man comes up to him and says“What are you doing? This beach goes on for miles. There are millions of star fish that have been beached. You’re never going to be able to make a dent in this problem. You’re wasting your time.” The kid picks up a starfish and says “I guess it matters to this one.” and chucks it in. I loved that story because,I guess, it’s a metaphor for us about our lives on this shared planet.

The only solution can be when we all focus on what’s right in front of us and we grab a starfish and we chuck it back. We know that actually if you’re joined by a couple more people at the beach and they bring a few more people on the other end of the beach and suddenly everyone is on the beach chucking starfish back that you could actually make a fair amount of progress.

If you listened to the voice of the person who says you’re wasting your time, you’ll make no progress at all, I can guarantee it. Dante once said, “The deepest places in hell are reserved for those when times of great moral crisis maintained their neutrality.” which in a nutshell means there’s nothing worse than doing nothing and saying nothing when your voice is needed.

As you head out into the world with new jobs and new life experiences, I beg of you, do not maintain neutrality. Pursue excellence, break down those walls, and push through the barriers, try to understand people, where they are, people who don’t know and people you think you do you know. Seek to know so you can understand communities other than your own. We’re all in this together to make America even greater than that, as my mom would say, requires a constant curiosity about each other and accountability to each other. I guarantee you that is what will bring you life satisfaction and improve the world for everyone.

Congratulations to the class 2012.

Thank you.I never thought I’d be a doctor. I thought I might play one someday but this is quite an honor. I’d like to thank the board of trustees of this incredible university. President Goro, Deacon Tomand the wonderful faculty and students of the department of theater and dance. I’d also like to thank all of you sitting out here today. I’m in awe of the work, dedication and commitment of every single student from every single major and I’m humbled by the love and sacrifice of all the parents and spouses and family members of all the students.

The real honor, I feel, in this honorary degree is in being associated with all of you and knowing that we share a connection with this wonderful institution. I’d only hope that I can be worthy of it.

I didn’t always want to be an actress. When I was a little girl I had big dreams. I dreamt of being a bank teller. I did, it’s true.I loved the idea of working in the drive through window, greeting people, taking their money and giving lollipops in return, I even had a mini cash register and a calculator at home and my parents let me open my first bank account when I was 10.

It’s ironic that I ended up in such an unstable and unpredictable career as an actor. So many people say acting isn’t brain surgery and they have a point. I’ll admit that basically I play pretend for a living.

To some folks a job like that might seem insignificant. I’m just singing and dancing, right?

Yes, it isn’t brain surgery but it’s not insignificant either. It’s my career and my passion. I’ve learned more about myself through this profession than I ever could have imagined, about life in general and I want to share certain things that I’ve experienced that might help some of you as you move into the opening act of your adult lives.

I’ll bet that most of you have a lot more in common with me than you think. I was born in a small college town in Georgia. My parents Helen and Bob Foster were good upstanding middle class people. My dad worked in sales for GM, primarily Chevy, and my brother Hunter and I grew up very modestly.

A lot of people ask if we grew up listening to show tunes when we were kids and that couldn’t be farther from the truth. My mom loved the movies and once wanted to be a model but as far as Broadway and theater, it was not something that we knew a lot about.

I had, much to the dismay of my parents and brother, a lot of energy and I was always ‘spazzing’ around the house. So my mother, in an effort to channel some of that energy, got me into ballet class when I was four.

I think she thought that ballet would give me some grace instead I just ended up being a spaz in a tutu. It was right then and there that I knew that I loved to dance. Of course I tried other things besides dancing, like basketball but I was a complete disaster on the court because I would dance instead of dribble.

I would dance everywhere, in the house, the hallways of school, up and down the aisles of the grocery store and after a few years at the dance studio and me terrorizing the local folk with my rond de jambes.

As things would have it, one day the studio got a call about a local production of Annie at the AugustaPlayer’s Community. As I said before we didn’t really know much about theater in our house, my brother had done a couple of community theater shows and I had been in the chorus of A Christmas Carol but that was it.

I didn’t want to audition for Annie but my mom encouraged me and so I went. I had to sing first and apparently everyone got really quiet when I started to sing at the piano.

I was oblivious and when I was finished I was just happy it was over so I could get back home to watch Fraggle Rock. Later that day, we got the phone call; they cast me as Annie. It would be that experience age 10, getting to sing such great songs as Maybe and Tomorrow on a bare stage to a packed house in one of the all-time great musicals, that had me hooked.

Since AnnieI’ve played all sorts of characters, show girl, princesses, evangelists, and a dog capturer. In2000I was playing a street merchant in the Broadway touring production of the lovely Les Miserables. I was making a pretty handsome salary, the most money I’d ever made and I was playing a role I had dreamed of since I was 13 years old.

I had the role for over a year when the producers asked if I would take over the character on Broadway permanently. It was an incredible deal, more money and guaranteed long-term employment and a chance to play my dream role on Broadway.

However I had just auditioned for the lead character of Millie, in a new show called Thoroughly Modern Millie.The show was scheduled to go to the Jolla Playhouse in San Diego to work out the kinks before it possibly came to NewYork and Broadway.

So before I said yes to Les MisI wanted to see if I had landed this incredible role in this brand new musical. So I anxiously waited for the phone call from my agent about Millie. When he called I got the bad news.I didn’t get it and I was devastated. AsI held the phone I was thinking, well it’s ok at least I still have my role in Les Mis. However my agent wasn’t finished.

They wanted me to be the understudy. So my two choices were: guaranteed dream role in one of the biggest hits on Broadway or being the understudy for the lead in a brand new musical that may or may not ever be seen again outside the state of California. What would you do?

When I was a kid I would fearlessly jump into the swimming pool but then almost drown because I didn’t know how to swim. Nevertheless, this attitude towards life has served me well. Say yes to opportunity. Sink or swim, it’ll change your life.SoI decided, to the dismay of a lot of people around me, to take the lead and accept the understudy position in Millie.

It was an opportunity and a chance to work on a new show with new people and I really liked it. I believed in its potential. SoI went to La Jolla with the show and worked really hard learning my part asa chorus member and learning the role of Millie as the understudy. I was going to make sure that I was good in the part in the event ever had to go on.

A few weeks into rehearsals the woman they had casted as Millie got sick and I stepped in for her for a few days.I didn’t think much about it. That was my job. I learned the role and I did the best I could while she was out. About three days later they ask me to take over the role. I did and the rest, as they say, it’s history.

The show is incredibly successful and eventually moved to Broadway with me as the unknown starlet and I won my first Tony award in that role. It was a huge hit on Broadway and it changed my career forever.

You have to have the courage to go with your gut and a willingness to take the smaller job. Like life, in theater it doesn’t pay to have a big ego. No jobs are too small for you. IfI didn’t take the understudy position because I was too proud or felt it was beneath me, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be standing here in front of you today.

Say yes. Get coffee for people, run errands, make an impression as a hard worker, someone who is willing when the opportunities arise for you to show people what you’ve got, show them. Who knows what’ll happen?

I love what I do for a living; I love it so much that sometimes I’m surprised when I get paid to do it but all work is still work no matter what you do or how much you love it. I’m proud of my work and I’m a self-proclaimed workaholic. I pour myself into my craft.

WhenI’m80 years old and I look back on my life,I knowI won’t say “Gosh I really wish I had worked more.” It has taken me a long time to find balance in my life, to realize what is truly important and what I value most and that’s real relationships.

In my life and work relationships are essential. Actors constantly move from job to job. Some jobs last two weeks, while others can last two years. You’re constantly working with new people and constantly starting over. You need a base to come back to, family, friends, friends who’ve become family.

I’m sure many of you have formed those kinds of relationships during your time here at Ball State and here’s the thing, as you move through your life you’ll discover that real, true intimate loving relationships don’t take away from your work or life or creativity, they add to it. Invest in relationships and you’ll meet untold rewards.

Believe me, the energy you put out in the world, not just in to your work in art, into your life, that energy comes back to you and beautiful ways. I know it sounds ‘woo wooey’ but it’s true and while the ever-changing life of an actor makes you eternally grateful for these relationships it also allows you new and daunting challenges at every turn. It’s taught me to be open, willing to adapt, to see things differently. Today as college graduates might be thinking “Damn, I’m finally done learning.” but the exciting truth is you never are.

I had the pleasure working with Tony, Oscar and Golden Globe winner, actor Joel Gray, my co-star inAnything Goes. He just turned 80 last month. He turned to me one day and said, “I’ve never been happier. I keep learning more and more about myself every day.” At 80 years old and he’s still learning about himself and that excites me greatly.

The late Steve Jobs, who was not an actor of course, but someone I identify with because he was so passionate about his work. He said in his commencement speech to Stanford in 2005 that he asked himself every day, “If today when the last day of my life wouldI want to do what I’m about to do today? Whenever the answer has been no too many days in a rowI know I need to change something.”

I really like this question. It’s a great tool for taking stock and challenging the status quo but you have to have the courage to answer it honestly and then act on the answer. You must be the author of your own life. You have the power to do what you want with it. You can continue on your path or you can change that path anytime. It’s your life after all.

There is one more bit of advice I’d like to share and it’s one that most of the theater and dance kids recognize. My best advice to you is, no matter what your profession is, don’t be a jerk. It just doesn’t pay to be a jerk. When you talk about climbing the ladder of success it really pays to be kind to the ones you need along the way. Kindness, respect and all that good stuff it just goes a long way.

As an actor you never know what you’re next job will be and you don’t know who might be in a position to give it to you. It’s exciting and terrifying but if you’ve been a jerk to someone who might be part of your next opportunity then you’re in deep doo doo.No matter if you’re a doctor, a lawyer, a pastor, an actor or a student leader just don’t be a jerk.

To make it in any profession and any job you have to work hard and find a way to love it. All forms of success, from being a great mother to being a great actor take tenacity and determination. They say for every light onBroadway there is a broken heart, an unrealized dream and that’s the same in every profession.

So you have to want it more than anyone else and you have to be your own champion, be your own superstar.Blaze your own path. Say yes to opportunity. Follow your instincts, be eager and passionate. Keep learning. Nurture your real lasting relationships and don’t be a jerk. Free your imaginations so you can become all that you want to be.

Thank you so much and congratulations to the class of 2012 of Ball State University!

Graduates, faculty, family and friends, I'm very honored to be here today to congratulate Sixth College's class of 2012. To be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing here.  When I got the invitation I was speechless; I literally had no speech, but now I do - bad joke.

I'm sure a lot of you wished Conan was your speaker here today since it was mentioned that Conan was your - well Sixth College was named Conan O' Brian College for a day. Sorry, I'm not Conan. But I was there at that event and I got a chance to talk to him so you get the guy who talked to guy you wish was here - close enough.

Who am I? I'm one of you, a very proud Sixth College Triton (Triton is UCSD'S mascot). Speaking of which, do you guys know how awesome it is to be a Triton? If you just look at the competition, you have Santa Cruz with their very fierce banana slug; you have Irvine - a very threatening and deadly anteater. Merced has a cute little bobcat, and Santa Barbara’s gauchos are playing horsy with the mustangs over at Davis. And then there's LA, Berkeley and Riverside all fighting to be the big bad bear (All these are other California unis and their mascots). We have a Triton - son of Poseidon, God of the Sea...Ariel's dad. Technically, we rule 75% of the world so I think that puts us at the top of the UC food chain. So, be proud Tritons, I sure am. I still carry my UCSD ID card all over, and it's because I'm proud, not because I still get student discounts on movie tickets. When they ask if you're a student, the answer's always yes.

But really, my story and experiences aren't so different from yours. I remember moving into Camp Snoopy - The Lodges (the dorms of Sixth College, which look a bit like cabins hence the nickname), and thinking “This is college?". I remember taking my first CAT (Culture, Art and Technology) class and staying up all night to write my first CAT paper. I remember missing my first Sociology class because Peterson just felt too far, and my bed just felt too good - it made sense. I remember my first Sun God (An annual UCSD festival) - well, parts of it. I remember waiting for the shuttle when I didn't have a fancy website to tell me where it was - I actually had to wait, not check the website.  And most of all I remember being where you are now, with the same feelings of apprehension, anxiousness and pride that you probably have right now.

What I'm getting at is that I'd like to speak to you as a peer more than anything, because I'm really not above you. I'm a few years up, but we're on the same level. I guess technically right now I am above you because of the stage ...puts me above...bad joke.

So what happens from this point forward? What happens when I'm done talking, when the photos have been taken, when the celebratory dinners have been eaten? Well everyone's post-graduate experience is different - some of you will continue on to your jobs and internships, some of you will keep going with school, some of you will travel. Others will waste away their days watching endless cat videos on Youtube and eating nothing but flaming hot Cheetos. Whatever your path is, it'll probably start with one question from your family and friends: what's your plan? Before you tell them anything, I want you to tell yourself: don't worry, don't stress, it's ok.

The truth is many of us are just as lost as we were when we graduated high school. Four years ago you thought you have to have your life planned out when you chose a college and major, and now you're facing that same dilemma. But just because you graduated, doesn't mean you have all the answers. I made a note here to see how many parents would be giving me the evil eye after saying that. Sorry.

Graduates, just because you finished college doesn't mean you finished learning - none of us have. And that's what I want to emphasize. You still have time to make decisions, make mistakes, take chances and continue to grow. Of course it's great to have a plan but unfortunately until Doc Brown invents the flux capacitor and builds a DeLorean time machine (Back to the Future reference), the forecast of the future is not decided, and it's not determined. So what's just as important as having a plan is being able to adapt. A lot of the best things I've experienced are things I never knew or never expected or knew to prepare for.

I like to share an email that I received not too long ago that seems oddly fitting for today:
"Hello Wong Fu! My name is Anthony; I'm from Poland. I'm thirteen and stuff. I've watched many of your shorts and videos over a few years and I just wanted to say that you guys really inspire me. How do you get your parents to let you do what you want to do 'cause my mom would cut my head off if I didn't become a doctor? Please tell me how to be successful and famous. Cool thanks."

Let's start with the parent thing. Graduates, whether it's obvious or not, your parents really do want what's best for you. I know their intentions might get lost in translation sometimes but it's true. The fact that you can experience the last four years, leading up to this very moment is proof of that. So thank them for it because they're awesome. And parents, let your sons and daughters explore a world that may be very different from the one you grew up in. The world is changing and we need to change with it.

In response to Anthony's request about success and fame, I can't say I have those just yet, but I do consider myself very fortunate. It didn't happen overnight though. I had a very unique post-grad experience. In the past few years I've been able to share my work with over a million people online, collaborate with various artists, create an apparel brand, travel the world and even meet the president of the United States at the White House. But it wasn't always like that. Sorry Anthony from Poland, but none of those things were planned.

I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with Wong Fu Productions but in case you're not, we're probably most known for our videos on Youtube. The funny thing is when I first started with my friends Philip and Ted in 2004, Youtube didn't even exist. We were running around the campus and uploading videos to a personal website that people had to download to watch. It was very different back then. Our media classes - we learnt more about concept and theory than technical skills. Sometimes it felt like we were actually learning about how a camera made us feel instead of how to use it.  But I loved the major, I really did. To adapt we had to teach ourselves and be resourceful with what we had. We had to make a little look like a lot. It was primitive, unconventional, and it was fun. We didn't know it then, but our resourcefulness was an advantage that would set us apart in the future. We never thought our shorts would attract an audience outside UCSD but they did.

I remember being where you are now and finding myself in unfamiliar territory. The three of us couldn't simply make videos for fun anymore. We entered the real world and had to rely on shooting wedding videos and events at nightclubs to pay the bills. It lasted awhile and to be honest it wasn't the best time for Wong Fu Productions. What I learnt though, and what continues to prove itself today is that with each new obstacle comes a new opportunity to grow. We stumbled across that opportunity when we featured a T-shirt that I designed for a short video we've made. The short went viral, and so did the shirt. From there we established an online store and our own clothing brand. Philip, Ted and I were finally able to focus on creating original content that makes Wong Fu Productions into what it is today.

My experience is just one example of how adapting will allow you to take advantage of unexpected changes. Another example is when Tony Stark found out he was going to die when he found this shrapnel lodged in his chest. Did he give up? No, he adapted. He made the arc reactor and became Iron Man. You should all be Iron Men, and Women.

I think a lot about the moments when things were first set in motion. For you, that moment is now. And I couldn't be more excited. You know that part in the speech where I give you some call to action or homework for the future? I'm not going to do that because homework sucks. But I will encourage you not to just make a living, but to live to make something. As graduates from Sixth College, and UC San Diego, I know each of you will excel in whatever you pursue. It's ok if I can't convince you of that, because I was just as doubtful back then. Just strive for the best, and you won't need to prove your potential to anyone else but yourself.

The last four years were made possible by your family, your professors and supportive friends. It was a shared experience, but today is yours. For many of you, this may be your proudest achievement. I don't believe that. Class of 2012, your proudest moments are the ones you've yet to come across. Good luck, congratulations.

Good afternoon, Principal Suraci, teachers, parents, families, friends, and my dear fellow classmates. Thank you for coming to our graduation. I am honor to speak to you today as your Valedictorian. 

Wow! We have finally made it to our graduation. Now, here comes my confession. Writing this speech was the most difficult assignment I received from Halsey. You see. Middle school was the most important part of my life so far, and I found it difficult to sum it up in just a few minutes. 

Three years ago, we all had an image of what the next three years of middle school would be. In my vision, life at Halsey would be frightening and exciting at the same time. 

I had lots of anxiety about going to Halsey after elementary school because of a brief experience as far back as 3th grade. And it was not a very assuring experience at the time. 

That winter, I was heading out to the Forest Hills Little League baseball tryout, which happened to be held at Halsey. My dad programmed the GPS in his car, heading for the school we had never heard of. (GPS was like the newest toy to my dad at that time before iphone ). And we got there half an hour later. When we got out of the car, a police officer came out and told us to “Get out”. Supposedly, there was a robbery happening in the neighborhood. That’s when we found out that the school we were in was The Halsey School, JHS.296, in Brooklyn. Oops…. 

So you can see why I was anxious about coming to Halsey. I was afraid to leave so many friends from my elementary school after 5th grade. At the same time, I was excited to meet new friends. So I spent the next three years figuring out what middle school would be like. Slowly, I came to the realization that many of you would become part of my dream of the future. 

In fact, we were all part of each other’s dream. We are our teachers’ dream of accomplishment as educators. We are our parents’ dream of pride as mentors. And we are our friends’ dream of support as companion, role model, admirer, and cheerleader. Together, we had spent the last three years making each other’s dream come true. 

Remember how confused we were when we first came to Halsey? Responsibility was completely foreign to us when we were told to remember such-and-such lunch number and so-an-so student identification number. 

WAIT… 
1. What are those things hanging on the wall?
2. Oh-my-god, are they cameras watching our every move? 
3. Are those… police officers? 
4. What the heck is going on in this strange world of middle school we just stumbled on?
5.	Are we going to be handcuffed if we were to misbehave inappropriately? 
6.	Where can I find a list of rules that I can follow, so I don’t get into trouble? 
HELP! I panic to search for a friend or even a familiar face. 

Middle school was completely different from elementary school. Middle school fed us a lot of independence in the beginning of 6th grade. It was a lot to get adjusted to and we had a lot of expectations. I noticed a few things back then, that I only really understood recently. 

The first thing I realized was that most of us were very insecure about ourselves. I felt insignificant. Everybody wants to be unique, and everybody wants to be special, but it’s hard to become special. I didn’t know how to become special. I worried about getting rejected. 

 

Then, we made our transition into middle school life without even realizing how it had happened. I realized that everyone wanted the support of others. From the first day of school, this has started to develop. We have gained the support of others, we got friends, and we have developed a strong support system for all of the obstacles we have faced. In doing so, we have gained the respect of others. 
The second thing that I noticed was that I like the new things that happened at Halsey everyday. We appreciated the new and wonderful things our teachers did to get our heads out of the clouds. We appreciated everything different, even the strange smells that sometimes emerged in the hallways. Remember the bathrooms flooding in 6th grade? It made us laugh. It gave us something to talk about. It introduced new things into our lives. It gave us more things to giggle at. It gave me more things to write about in my ELA assignments and in my speech today. 

The third thing that I noticed was that people wanted a paved road through Halsey. People wanted a road that would secure them throughout the three years. Our teachers supplied this paved road through troubles and issues. Today, you have reached a mark on that paved road named “Graduation”. This point leads to high school, another exciting and terrifying future. 

Halsey has many things that I will remember in the future. The one aspect of Halsey that had influenced my life most unexpectedly would have to be the talent department. In the 6th grade, we were required to pursue a talent class. I chose Drama. I did not know why and I didn’t know what to expect. All I heard was that it was very eccentric. You see. I was a very shy boy in elementary school. So I did not know what motivated me to pick an art that requires me to be on stage. 
To tell the truth, Drama surpassed all of my expectations and turned out to be more eccentric than I expected. As you can probably see today, now you can’t even get me off the stage . I’m staying here .

Drama has been digging deep at me ever since. It inspired me to pursue a passion that did not exist in me before. Along the way, I learned to pick up some confidence in speaking out my opinions, in handling rejections (which happens often during auditions), and in expressing myself. 

This is how Halsey has helped each one of us discover our passions and push us toward them. It gave us the confidence we need by showing us what we could accomplish with dedication. I thank our talent teachers for driving our dedication and will. 

I want to thank Principal Suraci for continuing to invest in the various talent programs at Halsey, with the limited funding you have. Because you know that investing in building a child’s confidence and self-esteem is just as important as investing in teaching a child how to add and subtract. 

In also want to thank our guidance counselor, Ms. Shriki, for her wisdom and her humor when dealing with many of our problems and issues coming in the bag of middle school “sensitivities”. 

Halsey ties in its teachers and its students. Together, we created the spirit of Halsey. That is the school’s greatest success… its community. Halsey events, Halsey teams, Halsey sports, and Halsey website. The community is shown through our enthusiasm. It is shown through our devotion to the school and the Halsey spirit. 

This spirit is further signified by graduates like you who return year after year to help out in the shows, parties, events, and such. After graduating today and parting from the community, we will keep the Halsey spirit in our heads and in our hearts. And I hope Halsey will continue to keep its door open to welcome our return to watch a show, help an event, or just for a visit or chat. 

Try to remember that every one of you is a star of your own. If you pay attention to others and extend a helping hand to those in need, you will be a star in someone else's life. So I urge you to stop seeking perfection in yourself in high school. Instead, take what you have learned from Halsey and channel your energy to seek success in helping those in need. 

Be conscious of social responsibilities. Donate your spare time to help others. Fight for those who can't fight. Speak for those who can't speak. Stand for those who can't walk. When you make a difference in someone else's life, you are the star in that person's eyes. And you will achieve success that ONLY YOU can achieve without being the second best. 

Be the best person you can be. Be generous to others and be generous also to yourself. You have achieved a lot more than you thought you could. Aim high. Dream big. Take risk. Don't be afraid of failure. When you are failing because you are taking risks, your parents and teachers would be proud of you. Your friend will admire you and cheer for you. 

As the class of ’12, we have been living each other for the past three years. However, it is time now for us to move on past Halsey. We are branching out into the world like a tree with its leaves drifting in the wind and its roots digging through the earth. We are going places unimaginable three years ago. 

The future is still not clear to me, but I believe that as a generation growing up with a new enterprise of science and technology, we have far more opportunities to contribute to humanity and make everybody here proud. Use your imagination. Don’t be afraid. The failures that we may have will result in success someday. 
Three years ago, we started walking down this paved road Halsey built. Today, we pass another checkpoint on that road. However, our journey going forward is no longer a lonely one. 

We have each other to lean on for encouragement. We have our beloved teachers at Halsey to call on for advices. And we have our parents to count on to pick us up whenever we fall. Let’s continue our journey together and continue to be in each other’s dream of the future from here on. 

Thank you very much. Congratulation! CLASS of 2012. 

Commencement speakers are traditionally expected to tell graduates how to go out there and climb the ladder of success, but I want to ask you, instead, to redefine success. Because the world you are headed into desperately needs it. And because you are up to it. Your education at Smith has made it unequivocally clear that you are entitled to take your place in the world on equal footing, in every field, and at the top of every field. But what I urge you to do is not just take your place at the top of the world, but to change the world.

What I urge you to do is to lead the third women's revolution.

The first was led by the suffragists over a hundred years ago, when brave women like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought, among other things, to give women the right to vote. The second women's revolution was powerfully led by Smith alumnae, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. They fought -- and Gloria continues to fight -- to expand the role of women in our society, to give us full access to the rooms of power where decisions are made.

And while the second revolution is still in progress, we simply can't wait any longer for the third revolution to begin. And I can't imagine a place where I would be more likely to find the leaders of that revolution than right here at Smith.

At the moment, our society's notion of success is largely composed of two parts: money and power. In fact, success, money and power have practically become synonymous.

But it's time for a third metric, beyond money and power -- one founded on well-being, wisdom, our ability to wonder, and to give back. Money and power by themselves are a two legged stool -- you can balance on them for a while, but eventually you're going to topple over. And more and more people, very successful people, are toppling over. Basically, success the way we've defined it is no longer sustainable. It's no longer sustainable for human beings or for societies. To live the lives we want, and not just the ones we settle for, the ones society defines as successful, we need to include the third metric.

In 2004, President Christ gave a speech that was really ahead of its time. It was titled "Inside the Clockwork of Women's Careers." To me, it's very much a third women's revolution call to arms. She spoke of the need to dispel myths about ambition and success, chief among them the myth that success and ambition look like a straight line. Now I guess it's no big surprise that the image of success created by men would be, yes, a long, phallic-shaped line.

But if we don't redefine success, the personal price we pay will get higher and higher. And as the data shows, that price is even higher for women than it is for men. Already, women in stressful jobs have a nearly 40 percent increased risk of heart disease, and a 60 percent greater risk for diabetes. And in the last 30 years, as women have made strides and gains in the workplace, self-reported levels of stress have gone up 18 percent.

Here's another fact that will likely be no surprise to you: the Millennial Generation, aka you, is the most stressed generation of all, outranking Baby Boomers and the gently euphemistic "Matures." Right now, America's workplace culture is practically fueled by stress, sleep-deprivation, and burnout.

Another Smith graduation speaker, Alistair Cooke, notoriously told the class of 1954 that their way to the top would be determined by whom they married.

I want to do old Alistair one better, and tell you that you don't get to the top by marrying someone. A much simpler way is to sleep your way to the top. Right now I imagine President Christ is thinking she probably should have vetted this speech.

But no, I'm talking about sleep in the literal sense. I know of what I speak: In 2007, sleep deprived and exhausted, I fainted, hit my head on my desk, broke my cheekbone and got four stitches on my right eye. And even as it's affecting our health, sleep deprivation will also profoundly affect your creativity, your productivity, and your decision-making. The Exxon Valdez wreck, the explosion of the Challenger Space Shuttle, and the nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island -- all were at least partially the result of decisions made on too little sleep.

According to researchers at Walter Reed hospital, the only thing that gets better with sleep deprivation is "magical thinking" and reliance on superstition. So for those of you majoring in fortune telling, go ahead and burn the midnight oil. The rest of you: not so much.

As you can tell by now, I'm a major sleep evangelist. The Huffington Post's office in New York sports two nap rooms: at the beginning our reporters, editors and engineers were reluctant to use them, afraid that people might think they're shirking their duties. We have to change workplace culture so that it’s walking around drained and exhausted that’s stigmatized. I’m happy to say, our nap rooms are now always booked. Although the other day I was walking by and I saw two people walking out of one of the nap rooms. But, hey, whatever it takes to recharge. Just don't tell HR, ok?

What adding well-being to our definition of success means is that, in addition to looking after our financial capital, we need to do everything we can to protect and nurture our human capital. My mother was an expert at that. I still remember, when I was twelve years old, a very successful Greek businessman coming for dinner. He looked rundown and exhausted. But when we sat down to dinner, he told us how well things were going for him. He was thrilled about a new contract he had just won to build a new museum. My mother was not impressed. "I don't care how well your business is doing," she told him bluntly," you're not taking care of you. Your business might have a great bottom line, but you are your most important capital. There are only so many withdrawals you can make from your health bank account, but you just keep on withdrawing. You could go bankrupt if you don't make some deposits soon." And indeed, not long after that, the man had to be admitted for an angioplasty.

When we include well-being in our definition of success, another thing that will change is our relationship with time. Researchers have come up with a term for our stressed out feeling that there's never enough time for what we want to do -- they call it "Time Famine." Every time we look at our watch it seems to be later than we think. I personally have long had a very strained relationship with time – more in line with a certain PhD from Oxford, in English Lit, actually -- Dr. Seuss.

"How did it get so late so soon?” he wrote. “It's night before it's afternoon. December is here before it's June. My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon?"

Does that feel familiar to anyone? Or, more likely, to everyone? The problem is that as long as success is defined by just money and power, climbing and burnout, we are never going to be able to enjoy that other aspect of the third metric: wonder.

I was blessed with a mother who was in a constant state of wonder. Whether she was washing dishes or feeding seagulls at the beach or reprimanding overworking businessmen, she maintained her sense of wonder, delighted at both the mysteries of the universe and the everyday little things that fill our lives. And whenever I'd complain or be upset about something, my mother had the same advice: "Darling, change the channel. You are in control of the clicker. Don't replay the bad, scary movie."

One of the gifts this attitude to life gave her was the ability to cut through hierarchies. One night, when I was in my twenties and still living in London, a Tory member of Parliament I was dating at the time (it might have been one of those decisions brought on by sleep deprivation) had brought the Prime Minister Edward Heath to dinner. My mother was in the kitchen, where she could be found most of the time, talking to the plumber, who had come to fix a last-minute problem. She asked the plumber what he thought of the prime minister. "Not much,” he said, “he hasn't been good for working people." "Let me go bring him here so you can tell him directly," my mother replied. And that's how the prime minister ended up in the kitchen talking to the plumber.

Well-being, wonder, and now I'd like to talk about another indispensable W -- wisdom.

Wherever we look around the world, we see very smart leaders -- in politics, in business, in media -- making terrible decisions. What they're lacking is not IQ, but wisdom. Which is no surprise, since it's never been harder to tap into our own wisdom. Because in order to do so, we have to disconnect from all our ever-present devices, our gadgets, our screens, our social media, and reconnect with ourselves. Your very own, very wise Smith sophomore, Erin McDaniel, wrote in the Sophian about her decision to disconnect from all her social media. "We have eschewed real social connections in favor of superficial, technology-bridged ones … We have become, in many cases, nearly as (socially) robotic as our computers."

Or, as Smith's Buddhist adviser Ry?mon Gutiérrez Baldoquín said, "people want to engage in something whole-heartedly in order to find meaning."

Back to my mother. The last time she got angry with me before she died was when she saw me reading my email and talking to my children at the same time. "I abhor multitasking," she said, in a Greek accent that puts mine to shame. In other words, being connected in a shallow way to the entire world can prevent us from being deeply connected to those closest to us -- including ourselves. And that is where wisdom lies. Don't worry -- you don't have the head of a digital news operation telling you to disconnect from technology altogether. What I’m saying is: learn to regularly disconnect from technology in order to connect with yourself. Learn to unplug in order to recharge. I'm convinced about two fundamental truths about human beings. The first truth is that we all have within us a centered place of wisdom, harmony, and strength. This is a truth that all the world's religions -- whether Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or Buddhism -- and many of its philosophies, hold true in one form or another: "The Kingdom of God is Within."

The second truth is that we're all going to veer away from that place again and again and again. That's the nature of life. In fact, we may be off-course more often than we are on-course. At The Huffington Post, we even came up with an app, called GPS for the Soul, that helps us get back to that place. I know there is something paradoxical about using technology to disconnect from technology, but the snake in our digital garden of Eden has been hyper-connectivity with technology. And we have to be more wily than the snake, hence using technology to help us disconnect from technology.

When we're in that centered place of wisdom, harmony and strength, life is transformed, from struggle to grace, and we are suddenly filled with trust, no matter the obstacles, challenges and disappointments. Because there is a purpose to our lives, even if it is sometimes hidden from us, and even if the biggest turning points and heartbreaks only make sense as we look back, not as we are experiencing them. So we might as well live life as if -- as the poet Rumi put it -- "Everything is rigged in our favor."

We've talked about well-being, wisdom, and wonder. And now, the last element of the third metric of success: empathy, compassion, the willingness to give back.

The founding fathers wrote about the pursuit of happiness, and if you go back to the original documents -- as I'm sure all of you have done -- happiness did not mean the pursuit of more ways to be entertained. It was the happiness that comes from feeling good by doing good.

I was at a neuroscience conference this week in Madison, Wisconsin, with the Dalai Lama, and there was plenty of scientific data provided that shows unequivocally that empathy and service increase our well-being. So that's how the elements of the third metric become part of a virtuous cycle.

Of course many of you already know that. Smithies have given back in countless ways, near and far: working with Chinese schools and NGOs through the Smith China Project, spending time in the community with people with disabilities through the Best Buddies program, tutoring children in Holyoke, and using digital storytelling to start conversations about health issues in Springfield.

So as you leave this beautiful campus today to follow your dreams and scale great heights in whatever profession you choose, I beg you: don’t buy society’s definition of success. Because it’s not working for anyone. It’s not working for women, it's not working for men, it's not working for polar bears, it's not working for the cicadas that are apparently about to emerge and swarm us. It's only truly working for those who make pharmaceuticals for stress, diabetes, heart disease, sleeplessness and high blood pressure.

So please don't settle for just breaking through glass ceilings in a broken corporate system or in a broken political system, where so many leaders are so disconnected from their own wisdom that we are careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. Change much more than the M to a W at the top of the corporate flow chart. Change it by going to the root of what's wrong and redefining what we value and what we consider success.

And remember that while there will be plenty of signposts along your path directing you to make money and climb up the ladder, there will be almost no signposts reminding you to stay connected to the essence of who you are, to take care of yourself along the way, to reach out to others, to pause to wonder, and to connect to that place from which everything is possible. "Give me a place to stand," my Greek compatriot Archimedes said, "and I will move the world."

So find your place to stand -- your place of wisdom and peace and strength. And from that place, lead the third women's revolution and remake the world in your own image, according to your own definition of success, so that all of us -- women and men -- can live our lives with more grace, more joy, more empathy, more gratitude, and yes, more love. And now, Smith College class of 2013, onward, upward and inward!

It's nice to be back at Princeton. I find it difficult to believe that it's been almost 11 years since I departed these halls for Washington. I wrote recently to inquire about the status of my leave from the university, and the letter I got back began, "Regrettably, Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can accommodate."1 

I'll extend my best wishes to the seniors later, but first I want to congratulate the parents and families here. As a parent myself, I know that putting your kid through college these days is no walk in the park. Some years ago I had a colleague who sent three kids through Princeton even though neither he nor his wife attended this university. He and his spouse were very proud of that accomplishment, as they should have been. But my colleague also used to say that, from a financial perspective, the experience was like buying a new Cadillac every year and then driving it off a cliff. I should say that he always added that he would do it all over again in a minute. So, well done, moms, dads, and families.

This is indeed an impressive and appropriate setting for a commencement. I am sure that, from this lectern, any number of distinguished spiritual leaders have ruminated on the lessons of the Ten Commandments. I don't have that kind of confidence, and, anyway, coveting your neighbor's ox or donkey is not the problem it used to be, so I thought I would use my few minutes today to make Ten Suggestions, or maybe just Ten Observations, about the world and your lives after Princeton. Please note, these points have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates. My qualification for making such suggestions, or observations, besides having kindly been invited to speak today by President Tilghman, is the same as the reason that your obnoxious brother or sister got to go to bed later--I am older than you. All of what follows has been road-tested in real-life situations, but past performance is no guarantee of future results.

1. The poet Robert Burns once said something about the best-laid plans of mice and men ganging aft agley, whatever "agley" means. A more contemporary philosopher, Forrest Gump, said something similar about life and boxes of chocolates and not knowing what you are going to get. They were both right. Life is amazingly unpredictable; any 22-year-old who thinks he or she knows where they will be in 10 years, much less in 30, is simply lacking imagination. Look what happened to me: A dozen years ago I was minding my own business teaching Economics 101 in Alexander Hall and trying to think of good excuses for avoiding faculty meetings. Then I got a phone call . . . In case you are skeptical of Forrest Gump's insight, here's a concrete suggestion for each of the graduating seniors. Take a few minutes the first chance you get and talk to an alum participating in his or her 25th, or 30th, or 40th reunion--you know, somebody who was near the front of the P-rade. Ask them, back when they were graduating 25, 30, or 40 years ago, where they expected to be today. If you can get them to open up, they will tell you that today they are happy and satisfied in various measures, or not, and their personal stories will be filled with highs and lows and in-betweens. But, I am willing to bet, those life stories will in almost all cases be quite different, in large and small ways, from what they expected when they started out. This is a good thing, not a bad thing; who wants to know the end of a story that's only in its early chapters? Don't be afraid to let the drama play out.

2. Does the fact that our lives are so influenced by chance and seemingly small decisions and actions mean that there is no point to planning, to striving? Not at all. Whatever life may have in store for you, each of you has a grand, lifelong project, and that is the development of yourself as a human being. Your family and friends and your time at Princeton have given you a good start. What will you do with it? Will you keep learning and thinking hard and critically about the most important questions? Will you become an emotionally stronger person, more generous, more loving, more ethical? Will you involve yourself actively and constructively in the world? Many things will happen in your lives, pleasant and not so pleasant, but, paraphrasing a Woodrow Wilson School adage from the time I was here, "Wherever you go, there you are." If you are not happy with yourself, even the loftiest achievements won't bring you much satisfaction.

3. The concept of success leads me to consider so-called meritocracies and their implications. We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies are fair. Putting aside the reality that no system, including our own, is really entirely meritocratic, meritocracies may be fairer and more efficient than some alternatives. But fair in an absolute sense? Think about it. A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate--these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others. As the Gospel of Luke says (and I am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in a good cause): "From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded" (Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible). Kind of grading on the curve, you might say.

4. Who is worthy of admiration? The admonition from Luke--which is shared by most ethical and philosophical traditions, by the way--helps with this question as well. Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their adversities. I think most of us would agree that people who have, say, little formal schooling but labor honestly and diligently to help feed, clothe, and educate their families are deserving of greater respect--and help, if necessary--than many people who are superficially more successful. They're more fun to have a beer with, too. That's all that I know about sociology.

5. Since I have covered what I know about sociology, I might as well say something about political science as well. In regard to politics, I have always liked Lily Tomlin's line, in paraphrase: "I try to be cynical, but I just can't keep up." We all feel that way sometime. Actually, having been in Washington now for almost 11 years, as I mentioned, I feel that way quite a bit. Ultimately, though, cynicism is a poor substitute for critical thought and constructive action. Sure, interests and money and ideology all matter, as you learned in political science. But my experience is that most of our politicians and policymakers are trying to do the right thing, according to their own views and consciences, most of the time. If you think that the bad or indifferent results that too often come out of Washington are due to base motives and bad intentions, you are giving politicians and policymakers way too much credit for being effective. Honest error in the face of complex and possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad results than are bad motives. For these reasons, the greatest forces in Washington are ideas, and people prepared to act on those ideas. Public service isn't easy. But, in the end, if you are inclined in that direction, it is a worthy and challenging pursuit.

6. Having taken a stab at sociology and political science, let me wrap up economics while I'm at it. Economics is a highly sophisticated field of thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices they made in the past were wrong. About the future, not so much. However, careful economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it can help kill ideas that are completely logically inconsistent or wildly at variance with the data. This insight covers at least 90 percent of proposed economic policies.

7. I'm not going to tell you that money doesn't matter, because you wouldn't believe me anyway. In fact, for too many people around the world, money is literally a life-or-death proposition. But if you are part of the lucky minority with the ability to choose, remember that money is a means, not an end. A career decision based only on money and not on love of the work or a desire to make a difference is a recipe for unhappiness.

8. Nobody likes to fail but failure is an essential part of life and of learning. If your uniform isn't dirty, you haven't been in the game.

9. I spoke earlier about definitions of personal success in an unpredictable world. I hope that as you develop your own definition of success, you will be able to do so, if you wish, with a close companion on your journey. In making that choice, remember that physical beauty is evolution's way of assuring us that the other person doesn't have too many intestinal parasites. Don't get me wrong, I am all for beauty, romance, and sexual attraction--where would Hollywood and Madison Avenue be without them? But while important, those are not the only things to look for in a partner. The two of you will have a long trip together, I hope, and you will need each other's support and sympathy more times than you can count. Speaking as somebody who has been happily married for 35 years, I can't imagine any choice more consequential for a lifelong journey than the choice of a traveling companion.

10. Call your mom and dad once in a while. A time will come when you will want your own grown-up, busy, hyper-successful children to call you. Also, remember who paid your tuition to Princeton.

Those are my suggestions. They're probably worth exactly what you paid for them. But they come from someone who shares your affection for this great institution and who wishes you the best for the future.

Congratulations, graduates. Give 'em hell.

Respected president of the famous university and other teachers and professors and, especially, young brothers and sisters who are achieving results of serious work – and perhaps occasionally some important examinations have happened where you might have lost your sleep. I myself, when I’ve seen the importance of examinations, I am sometimes a little bit nervous. But now you have really achieved the result of hard work of your study. I am also impressed with your students here while you study, you are also engaged with helping other people, serving other people – that is wonderful. I think that the very purpose of education is something – a meaningful life – in order to become a meaningful life is to take care of another’s wellbeing then you feel ‘ah, my life is now something meaningful.’ Just think of one’s self [in the] worst case – exploit others, bully others, cheat others. Deep down inside you don’t feel happy.

So, therefore, I believe the very purpose of life is happy life – happiness. For the simple reason – our existence is very much based upon hope. No guarantee that our future is something good, but we simply exist on hope. Hope means something good, something better. Therefore, once lost hope and completely demoralized, that mental attitude itself shortens your life, hurts your physical life, and then things become difficult. Despite difficulties, always keep optimism. ‘I can overcome these difficulties.’ That mental attitude itself will bring inner strength and self-confidence.

But also that way you can carry your conduct more honestly, more truthfully, more trustworthily. That brings trust. Trust brings friendship. We are social animals. We need friends. And also in the world, many problems – one individual cannot solve these things. Cooperation not only in your community, but on the global level. Like global warming – these problems – we need worldwide cooperation and effort. For that, trust and friendship are essential. I think that if two people are distant from one another, it’s difficult to expect some type of cooperation. The basis of cooperation is trust, friendship, so I appreciate that you have already started the work of serving others. That’s wonderful.

I heard you mention your own state and your own nation – that’s wonderful and as it should be. But at the same time, America, the greatest democratic country, you should look at the whole world – the global level. Actually I’m often telling people that America is the leading nation of the free world – very important. Think on the global level. In order to create a sense of global responsibility, it is extremely important to develop a concept of oneness of humanity. Seven billion human beings – we are part of that. Seven billion people are happy as well as the major positive environment, then everyone gets a benefit. If on a global level, seven billion people are facing some type of difficulties, individuals cannot escape that.

As far as formal education is concerned, I am someone who hasn’t attended class even for a single day. My knowledge compared to your knowledge is almost zero – nothing. It may not be very, very appropriate to tell you but according to my own experience, there are many problems on the global level and the national level – even on the community level. Many of these problems are actually our own creation. Natural disasters - these are beyond our control, but many problems are essentially our own creation. Logically, for these problems that we have created, we must have the ability to overcome these problems or to reduce these problems because these are man-made problems. If it is a problem created by some other [cause], then it is difficult to solve by human beings. But this is not the case; therefore, I offer to tell you, particularly to you young people now here – educated, fresh, bright - you have a long future.

Now I, not only myself but my generation (the professors – we are of the same generation, the generation of the 20th century), so our century already gone. So we of the generation of the 20th century are gradually saying ‘bye, bye.’ Now you – whose generation is age below 20, 30 – you truly are the generation of the 21st century. The 20th century, in spite of many encouraging achievements, marvelous achievements, but that century almost became the century of bloodshed – the century of violence. Some historians say that 200 million people killed through violence. That immense violence, included a nuclear weapon, nuclear bomb. If really created a better shape of the world, some may say ‘worthwhile’ – some justification. Now that’s not the case. Therefore, now this century, we are just in the beginning, about 13 years passed – 87 years yet to come. So, therefore, the future is open. Our behavior can really make a new shape of the world. So generation of the 21st century, think more on the global level and try to create a more peaceful world. This means a more compassionate world. So the sense of concern for others will be there – respect for others’ life. There, then, no room to use violence because you respect others’ life, you love others. How can a person who has that type of motivation, that type of mental attitude, use force to eliminate them? Impossible. So, therefore, a peaceful world means a compassionate world irrespective whether a believer or non-believer.

Biologically we are equipped – we have this potential. Young children, as soon as they are born, already receive immense affection from our mother, care. And for two years, our survival is completely dependent upon our mother’s care, mother’s milk. That’s everybody. We begin our life that way. So early in our life, we receive an immense amount of affection from others. So that seeps here, seeps in our blood – the potential of affection to others. So biologically we are equipped with a sense of concern of others’ well-being. And secondly, we are social animals. So biologically we need a sense of concern for others’ wellbeing. I think that an extreme selfish attitude, self-centered attitude gradually – these basic human values become more prominent and then the education of the brain further develops and society’s culture, materialistic culture – and that is the culture of a little bit competition. And that way aggressiveness further develops. That’s why seven billion human beings – right from the beginning more compassionate. But gradually that not much active. Aggressiveness, suspicion, distrust, bullying or cheating nowadays, then becomes stronger.

I think that we can reduce these things through education, through fairness, but not necessarily through prayer, not necessarily through religious faith but simply use common sense. Everyone wants a happy life, happy family, happy community. Real happiness has to do with emotion, not money. Therefore, now, please young brothers and sisters, pay some attention about our inner values. Then the brilliance of your brain and warm-heartedness come together. Your education, your knowledge then become constructive. If among the students really bright, but if you neglect about warm-heartedness, eventually some of you truly will become troublemakers on this planet. Education alone sometimes creates more problems.

Individuals themselves not always the happy one – always ‘worry, worry, worry.’ Loneliness, scared. When we meet this person – fear, distrust. Result – lonely feeling. That is against basic human nature. So please pay some attention, some knowledge on how to create inner peace. Through inner peace, all your profession, knowledge, can be constructive. All professional knowledge headed by [selfishness], motivated by anger, hatred, suspicion, then your knowledge becomes destructive. That much my own experience and also by observing others – that is something that an old person has better knowledge because of age. We have a lot of different experiences. So, therefore, when I meet some old, longtime friend, many cases express to me ‘Your face not much changed. Still looks young. What is secret about that?’ I have nothing. Ok, that’s too much. There is more ceremony. I do not want to spoil that.

So in anyway, now our hope is lying on your shoulders. Please think seriously on how to build a happy century, a peaceful century. This is what I think. Then, of course, I would like to express my congratulations for your graduation. Then also I want [to tell you this]. Until now some way other people taking care, some kind of routine, more or less protected. Now you start your real life. There could be more complicated difficulties. Then you should not – due to small incidents – demoralize. This is really the source of failure. In spite of difficulties, you must keep optimism and self-confidence. This is very important. That I wanted to share with you.

And then, whenever I receive an honorary degree, I always think what a great honor and I feel very happy. I must thank you. Usually without much effort, some degree is given to me – is wonderful. Thank you very much. So I promise, my senior brothers and sisters, young brothers and sisters, my age is already nearly 78 – I will last another ten years, 88, and most probably another 10 years, 98 – so I promise my body, speech and mind dedicated to the wellbeing of others. That I will carry. That kind of thinking. That kind of commitment. Hopefully your honorary degree may not spoil. Thank you. Bye bye.

It is a great honor to be here at Sewanee: The University of the South. I’m a long time admirer of Sewanee and I’ve gotten to know some of the great alumni, including my close friend Jon Meacham, who was the first person to be appointed editor of Newsweek before reaching puberty.

Graduates, I congratulate you. I feel like I know you. To get into a place like this you had to spend your high school years starting four companies, curing two formerly fatal diseases and participating in three obscure sports, like fencing, planking and snow volleyball.

Since you got to Sewanee you probably spent one spring break unicycling across Thailand while reading poetry to lepers. You spent an exciting summer interning at a congressional office, providing your boss with policy advice and sexual tension. You tell your friends you like Macklemore but secretly you like Taylor Swift.

While on campus, you have mastered new skills. You learned how to dominate classroom discussion even though you didn’t do any of the reading. In lecture halls you mastered another skill. Right now, for example, it looks as if you are staring at me with rapt attention, but in fact you are all sound asleep.

Now on this big day, your life takes an exciting turn. There are two paths ahead of you.One leads to a soul-crushing job as a cog in the corporate machine. The other leads to permanent residence in your parent’s basement.

I’m here to help you navigate these exciting opportunities. I will start by reminding you that you are at a beautiful spot in your lives. You are more mature than the freshman. Still sexier than the faculty. Also, you may not have been through college commencements before so you may not know the etiquette. After you get your degree, it’s customary to give Vice-ChancellorMcCardell a little tip. Ten or twenty bucks just to show he did a good job.

It’s also customary to give the commencement speaker a little something, though no more than $600 or $700—or $5,000 for econ majors. This money is not for me—I’m buying you people a cell phone tower. You need it here.

This may be your first college commencement, but you probably know commencement addresses have a certain form. The school asks a person who has achieved a certain level of career success to give you a speech telling you that career success is not important. Then we’re supposed to give you a few minutes of completely garbage advice: Listen to your inner voice. Be true to yourself. First, my generation leaves you a mountain of debt. Then we give you career derailing guidelines that will prevent you from ever paying it off.

Well, when I appear before fresh graduates, I do always ladle out some advice, but this is grade A material, tested with the scientific method.

My advice is going to be about what to worry about and what not to worry about. My job here is not to eliminate your worries. My job is to make sure you are worried about the right things. First, let me tell you about the things you should not worry about.

The first thing you shouldn’t worry about is the question: Will I be happy?This is not a problem. Most of you are in your twenties. Studies show that people get happier as they move through their twenties. Then happiness levels dip over the next several years and finally bottoms out when people are about 47 years old. This is called having teenage children. But then happiness levels rise again and people enjoy a big burst of happiness in the first ten years after retirement.

So at least for the next little while, you’re probably going to be happy. And it’s so easy to make sure you are. Join a club that meets once a month. That produces the same happiness gain as doubling your income. Use what money you have to buy experiences, not things. Don’t try to control other people; you can’t. Don’t ruminate on bad events.

The daily activity that contributes most to happiness is having dinner with friends. The daily activity that detracts most from happiness is commuting. Eat more. Commute less.

The second thing you shouldn’t worry about is the question: Will I get a good job?This is something to hustle for. It’s not something to be frantic about. The economy is mediocre but people with college degrees have a huge leg up. I’ve seen millions of people like you come this way before. By the time you’re 30, you’ll get good jobs and you’ll be happy in them. Lean into risk. Believe me, 95 percent of the people who take risks—whether it works out or not—are glad they did it.

The third thing not to worry about is the question: Will I find my passion? Commencement speakers are always telling you to find your passion. This is the biggest load of crap old people have ever foisted on the young. No, you will not find your passion. Your passion will find you. Relax and wait for it.

One of my heroes is a woman named Dorothy Day.When she was a young woman, Day thought she wanted to be a writer and a bohemian. She moved to Greenwich Village in New York. She hung out in bars, listened to jazz and had a lot of boyfriends. She read Dostoyevsky as if her life depended upon it, and sometimes seemed to live like a character in a Dostoyevsky novel. But something about the disorganized nature of that life bothered her.

One night she was wrongly arrested and put in jail. She had done nothing wrong, but to her the arrest seemed to indict her entire style of life.She wrote: “It was as ugly an experience as I ever wish to pass through. I do not think that ever again, no matter of what I am accused, can I suffer more than I did then of shame and regret, and self-contempt. Not only because I had been caught, found out, branded, publicly humiliated, but because of my own consciousness that I deserved it.”

Then a few years later, she had a very different experience. She gave birth to a child. She wrote that when her child emerged she felt like the greatest artist or the greatest poet:“No human creature could receive or contain so vast a flood of love and joy as I often felt after the birth of my child. With this came the need to worship, to adore.”

Her need to worship turned her toward God. And with that came a passion, to be among the poor. She started a newspaper called The Catholic Worker. She started soup kitchens and homeless shelters and rural communes. She didn’t serve the way we often serve today, as affluent people going down to give the needy a hand. She embraced poverty and lived in the shelters herself. For her the service was not about the meals. It was a form of worship and way to honor God.

Day wasn’t one of these people who could separate public behavior from private morality. Day couldn’t just do good, she had to be good. This wasn’t the life she could have envisioned for herself in college. This was the life that was thrust upon her.The lesson is: Don’t think about what you want from life. Think about what life wants from you. If you’re observant, some large problem will plop itself in front of you. It will define your mission and your calling. Your passion won’t come from inside. It will come from outside.

OK. I’ve given you a few things not to worry about. Now I’m going to tell you what you should be worrying about.

The first thing to worry about: Will I marry well? This is the most important decision you’re going to make in your life. If you have a great marriage and a crappy career, you will be happy. If you have a great career and a crappy marriage, you will be unhappy. I tell university presidents that since the marriage decision is so central, they should have academic departments on how to marry. They should teach the neuroscience of marriage, the sociology of marriage, the psychology of marriage. Everybody should get a degree in how to marry.

Nobody listens to me. So give yourself a degree. Read Jane Austen novels or George Eliot novels. Learn how to think about this problem from the masters. And take your time.

They say opposites attract, but the research suggests this is a high-risk proposition. It’s safer to marry somebody like yourself. Ladies, marry a guy who has some deep platonic friendships with women, somebody who shows some basic admiration for the gender.

Guys, marry a woman who is going to force you to talk, who won’t let you retreat into sullen silence when things don’t go your way.For those of you marrying somebody of your own sex, be a leader. Show the rest of us how it’s done.

The final and most important thing to worry about: Will I develop my second Adam? Let me explain what I mean.As you may know, the world is divided into two sorts of people, those who divide the world into two sorts of people and those who do not. I’m a divider. I see dualities everywhere. I think each of us is a duality. The best version of our individual duality comes from a great Rabbi named Joseph Soloveitchik.Soloveitchik said we have the two sides to our nature, which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is majestic Adam. Adam I wants to build, create, produce and subdue the world. Adam I wants to have a great career and win victories.

Adam II is humble Adam. Adam II wants to be enveloped by love and security. Adam II wants to feel and radiate joy. Adam II wants to live a life of virtue, not to do good but to be good, to have an inner soul that honors God, creation and one’sown possibilities.

Adam II is not interested in impressing society. He wants to savor the smell of a familiar meal with family. He wants to not only to behave well, but to behave well for the right internal reasons. He wants to practice virtue and be the sort of person who experiences a deep, strong and unshakeable happiness.

Soloveitchik said we are great because we live in the contradiction between these two Adams. They are not reconcilable. We are forever caught in self-confrontation.

The tension between the majestic Adam and the humble Adam tortures us but propels us sometimes to greatness.These days we happen to live in a culture that nurtures Adam I, the external career

Adam, and neglects Adam II, the internal joyful one. We live in a meritocratic society that encourages us to think about how to have a great career, how to win the admiration of our peers, how to build and create and discover, how to be a good friend and neighbor.

But if you are only Adam I, you turn into a shrewd animal, a crafty self-preserving creature who is adept at playing the game and who turns everything into a game.

People who live with this disease focus exclusively on the material world, on technology, on management books, and career strategies. Every day becomes a prudential strategy session as they chart their course to success.

If that’s all you have, you lose the ability to speak in a sophisticated moral language. You lose the experience of inner joy, without which life becomes unsupportable.

Maybe you’ve noticed this phenomenon. You go on a college campus and you meet a lot of amazing 21 year olds. But then you notice that two-thirds of them will be more boring by the time they hit 40. Their careers are fine, but they’ve lost their spiritual and intellectual sparkle. I doubt their Adam II is completely dead, but they have sent it into hibernation.

Maybe you’ve noticed how many how many politicians hit 40 and suddenly make fools of themselves with women, with sexting, narcissism and greed. They devoted everything to Adam I and in middle age they realize they are joyless and alone. They haven’t killed their Adam II, or even anesthetized it, but it like a garden left untended. Everything inside is chaos. They can’t experience the equanimity to experience completion and joy.

So this is the real thing to worry about: Will I develop Adam II every day? Will I live the permanent self-confrontation between worldly majesty and the moral humility?

The hard part of this confrontation is that Adams I and II live by entirely different logics. Adam I--the creating, building and discovering Adam--lives by a straightforward logic. It’s like the logic of economics. Input leads to output. Effort leads to reward. Practice makes perfect.

Adam II lives by an inverse logic. It’s a moral logic, not an economic logic. You have to give to receive. You have to be lost to be saved. Success leads to the greatest failure, which is pride. Failure leads to the greatest success, which is humility and learning. In order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself, you have to lose yourself.

Just as you have to take an economics course to learn the logic of Adam I, so you need to consult textbooks to understand the logic of Adam II. Most people find this wisdom in the Gospels, the Torah, the Koran or the writingsof Buddha. I have to confess I got a glimpse of it in college, though I didn’t know it at the time. I went to the University of Chicago, which is a Baptist school where atheist professors teach Jewish students St. Thomas Aquinas. I was assigned the great books, written by moral geniuses--by Thucydides, Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, or Reinhold Niebuhr. The books were written by people fixated by the struggle against their own sin. They are written by people obsessed with that great internal combat against weakness that we call character.

Over the years, I’ve lugged those books from apartment to apartment, house to house. These books, each in their own changing ways, help keeps the logic of Adam II in front of my eyes, though understanding that logic is the work of a lifetime. I doubt that these books will guide you to the end of your journey toward inner completion and joy, but they will start you on the way. I’ve mentioned Dorothy Day a few times. She was a beautiful writer and an organization builder.

It would have been natural for Day to write a memoir at the end of her life. And as she closed out her life, not far from death, she thought about doing that. She sat down one day at her desk to write. She told Robert Coles what happened next: “The other day I wrote down the words ‘A Life Remembered’ and I was going to try to make a summary for myself, write about what mattered most—but I couldn’t do it.

I just sat there and thought of the Lord and His visit to us all those centuries ago, and I said to myself that my great luck was to have had Him on my mind for so long in my life.”

So as you leave Sewanee I hope you build and create and discover and make tons of money, but I hope you’ll lug your books around and look at them from time to time. And at the end of your life I hope you have the awesome ability to NOT create, to NOT discover, to NOT build, but to just experience the joy and completeness and satisfaction of an Adam II life well lived.

Thank you.

Thank you Chairman Reed, and congratulations to all of you in the class of 2013.

I'm so happy to be back at MIT, and it's an honor to be here with you today. I still wear my Brass Rat, and turning this ring around on graduation day is still one of the proudest moments of my life.

There are a lot of reasons why this is a special day, but the reason I'm so excited for all of you is that today is the first day of your life where you no longer need to check boxes.

For your first couple decades, success in life has meant jumping through one hoop after another: get these test scores, get into this college. Take these classes, get this degree. Get into this prestigious institution so you can get into the next prestigious institution. All of that ends today.

The hard thing about planning your life is you have no idea where you're going, but you want to get there as soon as possible. Maybe you'll start a company, or cure cancer, or write the great American novel. Or who knows? Maybe things will go horribly wrong. I had no idea.

Being up here in robes and speaking to all of you today wasn't exactly part of my plan seven years ago. In fact, I've never really had a grand plan — and what I realize now is that it's probably impossible to have one after graduation, if ever.

I've thought a lot about what's different about the life you're beginning today. I've thought about what I would do if I had to start all over again. What got you here was basically being smart and working hard. But nobody tells you that after today, the recipe for success changes. So what I want to do is give you a little cheat sheet, the one I would have loved to have had on my graduation day.

If you were to look at my cheat sheet, there wouldn't be a lot on it. There would be a tennis ball, a circle, and the number 30,000. I know this doesn't make any sense right now, but bear with me.

I started my first company in a Chili's when I was 21. My cofounder, Andrew Crick, and I had never done this before. We were wondering if you needed to wear a suit to City Hall, or if you needed to make a company seal for stamping important documents. It turns out you can just go online and fill out a form and be done in about two minutes. It was a little anti-climactic, but we were in business. Over onion strings we decided that our company was going to make a new kind of online course for the SAT. Most kids back then were still using these old-school 800-page books, and the other online prep courses weren't very good. We called it Accolade, an SAT vocab word meaning an award of distinction. Well, actually, we called it "The Accolade Group, LLC" which we thought sounded a lot more impressive.

I stopped at Staples on the way home to pick up some card stock. Clearly, the most important order of business was to Photoshop a logo and print out some business cards that said "Founder" on them. The next order of business was to hand them out at conferences, and tell girls "why yes, I do have a company." It was awesome.

But the best part was learning all kinds of new things. I lived in my fraternity house every summer, and up on the fifth floor there's a ladder that goes up to the roof. I had this green nylon folding chair that I'd drag up there along with armfuls of business books I bought off Amazon and I'd spend every weekend reading about marketing, sales, management and all these other things I knew nothing about. I wasn't planning to get my MBA on the roof of Phi Delta Theta, but that's what happened.

A couple years later, things started going downhill. I felt like I had to paddle harder and harder to make progress, and at some point I just snapped and couldn't deal with any more math questions about parallel lines or the train leaving Memphis at 3:45. I figured something was wrong with me. I felt guilty for being so unproductive. Starting a company had been my dream, and, well, maybe I didn't have what it takes after all.

So I took a little break. Of course, if you're in course 6, sometimes "taking a break" means writing a poker bot. For those of you who don't know what a poker bot is, what happens when you play poker online is first, you sit for hours and click buttons, and then you lose all your money. A poker bot means you can have your computer lose all your money for you.

But it was a fascinating challenge. I was possessed. I would think about it in the shower. I would think about it in the middle of the night. It was like a switch went on — suddenly I was a machine.

In the middle of all this, my mom and dad wanted all of us to come up to New Hampshire to spend a family weekend together. But I really wanted to keep working on my poker bot. So I pull up in my Accord and open the trunk, and next I'm dragging all my computer stuff and all these wires into our little cottage. The dining room table wasn't big enough so I started moving all the pots and pans off the stove to make room for all my monitors. This time it was my mom who thought something was wrong with me. She was convinced I was going to jail.

I was going to say work on what you love, but that's not really it. It's so easy to convince yourself that you love what you're doing — who wants to admit that they don't? When I think about it, the happiest and most successful people I know don't just love what they do, they're obsessed with solving an important problem, something that matters to them. They remind me of a dog chasing a tennis ball: their eyes go a little crazy, the leash snaps and they go bounding off, plowing through whatever gets in the way. I have some other friends who also work hard and get paid well in their jobs, but they complain as if they were shackled to a desk.

The problem is a lot of people don’t find their tennis ball right away. Don't get me wrong — I love a good standardized test as much as the next guy, but being king of SAT prep wasn’t going to be mine. What scares me is that both the poker bot and Dropbox started out as distractions. That little voice in my head was telling me where to go, and the whole time I was telling it to shut up so I could get back to work. Sometimes that little voice knows best.

It took me a while to get it, but the hardest-working people don't work hard because they're disciplined. They work hard because working on an exciting problem is fun. So after today, it's not about pushing yourself; it's about finding your tennis ball, the thing that pulls you. It might take a while, but until you find it, keep listening for that little voice.

Let's go back to the summer after my graduation, the summer you're about to have. One of my fraternity brothers, Adam Smith, and his friend Matt Brezina were starting a company and we decided it would be fun for all of us to work together out of one apartment.

It was the perfect summer — well, almost perfect. The air conditioner was broken so we were all coding in our boxers. Adam and Matt were working around the clock, but as time went on they kept getting pulled away by potential investors who would share their secrets and take them on helicopter rides. I was a little jealous — I had been working on my company for a couple years and Adam had only been at it for a couple months. Where were my helicopter rides?

Things only got worse. August rolled around and Adam gave me the bad news: they were moving out. Not only was my supply of Hot Pockets cut off, but they were off to Silicon Valley, where the real action was happening, and I wasn't.

Every now and then I'd give Adam a call and hear how things were going. Things were always pretty good. "We met with Vinod this afternoon," he would tell me. Vinod Khosla is the billionaire investor and cofounder of Sun Microsystems. Then Adam dropped the bomb. "He's going to give us five million dollars."

I was thrilled for him, but it was a shock for me. Here was my faithful beer pong partner and my little brother in the fraternity, two years younger than me. I was out of excuses. He was off to the Super Bowl and I wasn't even getting drafted. He had no idea at the time, but Adam had given me just the kick I needed. It was time for a change.

They say that you're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Think about that for a minute: who would be in your circle of 5? I have some good news: MIT is one of the best places in the world to start building that circle. If I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have met Adam, I wouldn't have met my amazing cofounder, Arash, and there would be no Dropbox.

One thing I've learned is surrounding yourself with inspiring people is now just as important as being talented or working hard. Can you imagine if Michael Jordan hadn’t been in the NBA, if his circle of 5 had been a bunch of guys in Italy? Your circle pushes you to be better, just as Adam pushed me.

And now your circle will grow to include your coworkers and everyone around you. Where you live matters: there’s only one MIT. And there's only one Hollywood and only one Silicon Valley. This isn't a coincidence: for whatever you're doing, there's usually only one place where the top people go. You should go there. Don’t settle for anywhere else. Meeting my heroes and learning from them gave me a huge advantage. Your heroes are part of your circle too — follow them. If the real action is happening somewhere else, move.

The last trap you might fall into after school is "getting ready." Don't get me wrong: learning is your top priority, but now the fastest way to learn is by doing. If you have a dream, you can spend a lifetime studying and planning and getting ready for it. What you should be doing is getting started.

Honestly, I don't think I've ever been "ready." I remember the day our first investors said yes and asked us where to send the money. For a 24 year old, this is Christmas — and opening your present is hitting refresh over and over on bankofamerica.com and watching your company's checking account go from 60 dollars to 1.2 million dollars. At first I was ecstatic — that number has two commas in it! I took a screenshot — but then I was sick to my stomach. Someday these guys are going to want this back. What the hell have I gotten myself into?

You already know this feeling: at MIT we call it "drinking from the firehose." It’s about as fun as it sounds, and all of us have the internal bleeding to prove it. But we’ve also learned it's good for you. Today, one valve shuts off. Now you need to go out and find another firehose.

Dropbox has been mine. As you might expect, building this company has been the most exciting, interesting and fulfilling experience of my life. What I haven't really shared is that it's also been the most humiliating, frustrating and painful experience too, and I can't even count the number of things that have gone wrong.

Fortunately, it doesn't matter. No one has a 5.0 in real life. In fact, when you finish school, the whole notion of a GPA just goes away. When you're in school, every little mistake is a permanent crack in your windshield. But in the real world, if you're not swerving around and hitting the guard rails every now and then, you're not going fast enough. Your biggest risk isn't failing, it's getting too comfortable.

Bill Gates's first company made software for traffic lights. Steve Jobs's first company made plastic whistles that let you make free phone calls. Both failed, but it's hard to imagine they were too upset about it. That's my favorite thing that changes today. You no longer carry around a number indicating the sum of all your mistakes. From now on, failure doesn't matter: you only have to be right once.

...

My grandmother is here today, and next week we'll be celebrating her 95th birthday. We talk more on the phone now that I’ve moved out to California. But one thing that's stuck with me is she always ends our phone calls with one word: "Excelsior," which means "ever upward."

And today on your commencement, your first day of life in the real world, that's what I wish for you. Instead of trying to make your life perfect, give yourself the freedom to make it an adventure, and go ever upward. Thank you.

Hello Knox College!

Thank you students, faculty, parents, and elderly relatives who have no idea who I am.

It is such an honor to be in the presence of hundreds of the sharpest young minds in the country -- all simultaneously updating their Twitter. Hashtag -- Humbled.

I feel a special kinship with all of you. As a graduate of Oberlin College in rural Ohio, I know a thing or two about small Midwestern schools. They somehow mix heartland American values of hard work, grit and determination with a burning curiosity, a progressive disposition and a genuine thirst for knowledge. And of course, terrible sports teams with totally embarrassing mascots.

The Prairie Fires? Seriously?

It's interesting. I just feel like if it was up to me to choose a team name I would probably start with animals -- your "bulls," your "jaguars" -- and then move on to natural disasters. With all due respect, "The Prairie Fires" sounds more like a Steinbeck novel than a team name. And honestly, not even a good Steinbeck novel. You need something that strikes fear into the hearts of the opposing team, not something that strikes fear into groundhogs. See? Right there: The Knox Groundhogs! That would be a way better mascot!

So you're all wondering where to go from here and how your lives are going to turn out. Well, let me start by saying, you're all going to be fine. How do I know this?

Well, for starters you're all incredibly good-looking. But you have also just completed a phenomenal liberal arts education, which is the foundation of a constructive and meaningful life. With such a broad spectrum of knowledge, you're all infinitely employable. That said, if you majored in Classics, that one's on you. We'll be seeing you and your bust of Euripides at job fairs for years to come.

When I was first asked to speak to the Knox Class of 2013, I must admit: I didn't know if I was the guy you wanted giving advice. If you think about it: I'm best known for playing a character who makes nothing but bad decisions -- and then doesn't even remember them.

So I got nervous. I got scared.

It wasn't a physical fear of any kind. I'm pretty sure I could take any of you in a fist fight. And if not, my high-pitched screaming would surely paralyze you.

Rather, I was simply scared of screwing this up. What was I going to talk about?

But then it occurred to me, this is exactly what I DO have to share with you. My firsthand knowledge that one of the most valuable and life-informing things you can experience is, in fact, fear.

That's right, I'm here to tell you today that "Fear is good."

Maybe you feel fear right now -- fear that you won't land a job, fear that you won't find love, or fear that your Commencement speaker is completely nude under his robe. All very valid fears.

But to understand why fear is good, one has to stop viewing fear as a feeling, emotion or behavioral command, and start looking at it simply as information. Fear is good because it is our brain's way of identifying the things about which we are ignorant. Knowing this, we should look at our fear not as a reason to avoid the things that frighten us, but as a reason to engage them.

Now don't get me wrong: I'm not telling you to seek out things that are life-endangering, like fires or grizzly bears. Which, by the way, brings me to a very important point: you're supposed to run from a fire and play dead with a grizzly bear. Do not mix those up. Very important. And if you ever see a grizzly bear that's on fire, gently remind him to stop, drop, and roll. And if that works, and the bear is still alive, then you should, of course, immediately play dead.

All of that is to say, that fear of known physical danger is obviously warranted and needn't be questioned or overthought. But that other kind of fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear that shuts down action without any real explanation. When you feel that fear, let it be a trigger for curiosity.

When I was 8 years old, I watched Saturday Night Live for the first time. It blew me away. I didn't understand the jokes, but it didn't matter, I loved the energy. I just wanted to be a part of it. And as I grew older, my obsession became stronger. So when I finally graduated from college, I did what any aspiring comic would do: I moved to New York City, and I.... took a job as an assistant ?lm editor?

This was not comedy, but I rationalized it. "I need to make money. It will teach me about filmmaking, it will give me access to equipment so I can make my comedy films." I made myself believe those things and I worked hard. And let me tell you, I was good at it. I became an assistant editor at the top post-production company in New York, I was truly a go-to expert in the ?eld, and I was getting a lot of creative satisfaction from it. We were working on Super Bowl commercials with sexy ad executives, it was like Mad Men in the 1990s -- only instead of Jack Daniels, we were guzzling Crystal Pepsi. Don't judge, it was a different era.

And then my boss said -- HELMS! This is going great -- let's start our own company! What? I'm 25 years old -- this is amazing. I'll become a full-blown editor with my own assistant; my income will jump by orders of magnitude. My entrepreneurial career as a post-production mogul was laid out before me!

So why did I have a pit in my stomach?

Turns out that pit in my stomach was deep, abiding fear. But what was I afraid of? So I looked directly at my fear and said "What's going on? Why are you here?" And fear said, "Don't worry about it! You're doing great!" But I really grilled him and my fear shrugged his shoulders and said, "I'm here because you're afraid of failing at comedy. Which, might I remind you, is the entire reason you moved to New York City in the first place."

And it hit me like a rock. Looking deeper into my fear revealed something I truly wanted. And that precipitated a major course correction in my life. And I looked at all of that fear and I said, "Thank you!" And it said, "No problem, man. That's what I'm here for." And that's when I realized -- wow! If you let it, fear can become a kind of spirit guide on your path to a successful life.

It's worth pointing out here that there are infinite definitions for a successful life. Maybe you want to be the president, maybe you want be a great parent, or maybe you want to pretend to rip your tooth out and marry a stripper in a movie. All equally noble choices.

But simply asking ourselves what we want is easy. Another far more powerful question that can be much harder to explore, but has the potential to bring you breathtaking clarity, is simply: What do I fear?

So I took the plunge and dove headlong into the shark tank of New York City comedy. When you start doing standup, the first couple of times you go onstage, you kill. You're great at it, mainly because adrenaline is screaming through your brain AND you're over-prepared. And then you bomb for the first time. And it's brutal. And everyone says, "Shake it off, you just need to keep at it." And this is where I think a lot of comedians just throw in the towel.

Because you can't shake it off. When you fail at the thing you love, it isn't on the outside of you like dirt or spilled mayonnaise -- it's inside of you. It's in your molecules.

And so I was scared again. Really scared, because I'd made some big life changes to accommodate this path. But I had learned to dig a little deeper so I turned to my fear and I said, "Alright, start talking, what's going on here?" And my fear said, "Last night on stage, you tanked. And it was humiliating. So naturally I'm here to nag you and tell you not to get back on that stage." And that led me to another more deliberate question "What will happen if I do get back up there?" And fear squirmed a little, because fear despises truth, but he ?nally cracked and said, "Well, you're still here, right? And even if you tank again ...you'll still be here again. And here's a little silver lining that you wouldn't know if you hadn't bothered to talk to me about this. That crowd reaction, albeit brutal, is really useful data. When they laughed it was nice, but when they didn't it was even more valuable. Why did that one joke work two nights ago and bomb tonight?"

And just as before, fear actually helped me out. I had recordings of those standup sets and I was terrified to listen to them, but I did it and I heard the subtlest variations in my timing, I heard noise in the room that changed the energy, I heard details. And I made adjustments. And I got better. Much better. And I never would have if I hadn't bombed, and if fear wasn't there to point out exactly where I needed to focus.

Now, obviously fear can't talk, and thank god because I imagine it would have a horrifying voice like the guy from Saw, but I've anthropomorphized fear to make a point. Which is that if you strike the right relationship with your fear, it can tell you a lot of really exciting things besides simply just what to be afraid of.

If our ancestors didn't feel fear, the whole species probably would have been trampled by mammoths a long time ago. But if they never examined their fears -- no delicious mammoth-burgers. And so, success lies in the tension between fear and discovery.

That tension will always be there, but so long as your desire to explore is greater than your desire to not screw up, you're on the right track. A life oriented toward discovery is infinitely more rewarding than a life oriented toward not blowing it.

So don't be afraid of fear. Because it sharpens you, it challenges you, it makes you stronger; and when you run away from fear, you also run away from the opportunity to be your best possible self.

And so, today, in facing my own fear squarely, and using it to interrogate myself, I realized something I should have known from the start: no slightly-older, reasonably famous man or woman standing at a podium in an ill-fitting graduation gown, can actually TELL you what you need to know upon setting out this day.

Indeed, the truth about fear, as with the rest of life, is that you'll only really figure it out by living through it. So, by god, get out there and live. Take your lumps. Dole out a few lumps. And trust you'll figure it out.

Trust your instincts, trust your passions, trust your empathy, and trust your love. And trust that even fear itself will want to stop, drop and roll when confronted with the unstoppable passion and power of a Knox Prairie Fire.

Thank you and congratulations!

Down through the ages, a traditional form has evolved for this type of speech, which is: Some old fart, his best years behind him, who, over the course of his life, has made a series of dreadful mistakes (that would be me), gives heartfelt advice to a group of shining, energetic young people, with all of their best years ahead of them (that would be you).

And I intend to respect that tradition.

Now, one useful thing you can do with an old person, in addition to borrowing money from them, or asking them to do one of their old-time “dances,” so you can watch, while laughing, is ask: “Looking back, what do you regret?” And they’ll tell you. Sometimes, as you know, they’ll tell you even if you haven’t asked. Sometimes, even when you’ve specifically requested they not tell you, they’ll tell you.

So: What do I regret? Being poor from time to time? Not really. Working terrible jobs, like “knuckle-puller in a slaughterhouse?” (And don’t even ASK what that entails.) No. I don’t regret that. Skinny-dipping in a river in Sumatra, a little buzzed, and looking up and seeing like 300 monkeys sitting on a pipeline, pooping down into the river, the river in which I was swimming, with my mouth open, naked? And getting deathly ill afterwards, and staying sick for the next seven months? Not so much. Do I regret the occasional humiliation? Like once, playing hockey in front of a big crowd, including this girl I really liked, I somehow managed, while falling and emitting this weird whooping noise, to score on my own goalie, while also sending my stick flying into the crowd, nearly hitting that girl? No. I don’t even regret that.

But here’s something I do regret:

In seventh grade, this new kid joined our class. In the interest of confidentiality, her Convocation Speech name will be “ELLEN.” ELLEN was small, shy. She wore these blue cat’s-eye glasses that, at the time, only old ladies wore. When nervous, which was pretty much always, she had a habit of taking a strand of hair into her mouth and chewing on it.

So she came to our school and our neighborhood, and was mostly ignored, occasionally teased (“Your hair taste good?” — that sort of thing). I could see this hurt her. I still remember the way she’d look after such an insult: eyes cast down, a little gut-kicked, as if, having just been reminded of her place in things, she was trying, as much as possible, to disappear. After awhile she’d drift away, hair-strand still in her mouth. At home, I imagined, after school, her mother would say, you know: “How was your day, sweetie?” and she’d say, “Oh, fine.” And her mother would say, “Making any friends?” and she’d go, “Sure, lots.”

Sometimes I’d see her hanging around alone in her front yard, as if afraid to leave it.

And then — they moved. That was it. No tragedy, no big final hazing.

One day she was there, next day she wasn’t.

End of story.

Now, why do I regret that? Why, forty-two years later, am I still thinking about it? Relative to most of the other kids, I was actually pretty nice to her. I never said an unkind word to her. In fact, I sometimes even (mildly) defended her.

But still. It bothers me.

So here’s something I know to be true, although it’s a little corny, and I don’t quite know what to do with it:

What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.

Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering, and I responded . . . sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.

Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth?

Those who were kindest to you, I bet.

It’s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I’d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.

Now, the million-dollar question: What’s our problem? Why aren’t we kinder?

Here’s what I think:

Each of us is born with a series of built-in confusions that are probably somehow Darwinian. These are: (1) we’re central to the universe (that is, our personal story is the main and most interesting story, the only story, really); (2) we’re separate from the universe (there’s US and then, out there, all that other junk – dogs and swing-sets, and the State of Nebraska and low-hanging clouds and, you know, other people), and (3) we’re permanent (death is real, o.k., sure – for you, but not for me).

Now, we don’t really believe these things – intellectually we know better – but we believe them viscerally, and live by them, and they cause us to prioritize our own needs over the needs of others, even though what we really want, in our hearts, is to be less selfish, more aware of what’s actually happening in the present moment, more open, and more loving.

So, the second million-dollar question: How might we DO this? How might we become more loving, more open, less selfish, more present, less delusional, etc., etc?

Well, yes, good question.

Unfortunately, I only have three minutes left.

So let me just say this. There are ways. You already know that because, in your life, there have been High Kindness periods and Low Kindness periods, and you know what inclined you toward the former and away from the latter. Education is good; immersing ourselves in a work of art: good; prayer is good; meditation’s good; a frank talk with a dear friend; establishing ourselves in some kind of spiritual tradition — recognizing that there have been countless really smart people before us who have asked these same questions and left behind answers for us.

Because kindness, it turns out, is hard — it starts out all rainbows and puppy dogs, and expands to include . . . well, everything.

One thing in our favor: some of this “becoming kinder” happens naturally, with age. It might be a simple matter of attrition: as we get older, we come to see how useless it is to be selfish — how illogical, really. We come to love other people and are thereby counter-instructed in our own centrality. We get our butts kicked by real life, and people come to our defense, and help us, and we learn that we’re not separate, and don’t want to be. We see people near and dear to us dropping away, and are gradually convinced that maybe we too will drop away (someday, a long time from now). Most people, as they age, become less selfish and more loving. I think this is true. The great Syracuse poet, Hayden Carruth, said, in a poem written near the end of his life, that he was “mostly Love, now.”

And so, a prediction, and my heartfelt wish for you: as you get older, your self will diminish and you will grow in love. YOU will gradually be replaced by LOVE. If you have kids, that will be a huge moment in your process of self-diminishment. You really won’t care what happens to YOU, as long as they benefit. That’s one reason your parents are so proud and happy today. One of their fondest dreams has come true: you have accomplished something difficult and tangible that has enlarged you as a person and will make your life better, from here on in, forever.

Congratulations, by the way.

When young, we’re anxious — understandably — to find out if we’ve got what it takes. Can we succeed? Can we build a viable life for ourselves? But you — in particular you, of this generation — may have noticed a certain cyclical quality to ambition. You do well in high-school, in hopes of getting into a good college, so you can do well in the good college, in the hopes of getting a good job, so you can do well in the good job so you can . . .

And this is actually O.K. If we’re going to become kinder, that process has to include taking ourselves seriously — as doers, as accomplishers, as dreamers. We have to do that, to be our best selves.

Still, accomplishment is unreliable. “Succeeding,” whatever that might mean to you, is hard, and the need to do so constantly renews itself (success is like a mountain that keeps growing ahead of you as you hike it), and there’s the very real danger that “succeeding” will take up your whole life, while the big questions go untended.

So, quick, end-of-speech advice: Since, according to me, your life is going to be a gradual process of becoming kinder and more loving: Hurry up. Speed it along. Start right now. There’s a confusion in each of us, a sickness, really: selfishness. But there’s also a cure. So be a good and proactive and even somewhat desperate patient on your own behalf — seek out the most efficacious anti-selfishness medicines, energetically, for the rest of your life.

Do all the other things, the ambitious things — travel, get rich, get famous, innovate, lead, fall in love, make and lose fortunes, swim naked in wild jungle rivers (after first having it tested for monkey poop) – but as you do, to the extent that you can, err in the direction of kindness. Do those things that incline you toward the big questions, and avoid the things that would reduce you and make you trivial. That luminous part of you that exists beyond personality — your soul, if you will — is as bright and shining as any that has ever been. Bright as Shakespeare’s, bright as Gandhi’s, bright as Mother Teresa’s. Clear away everything that keeps you separate from this secret luminous place. Believe it exists, come to know it better, nurture it, share its fruits tirelessly.

And someday, in 80 years, when you’re 100, and I’m 134, and we’re both so kind and loving we’re nearly unbearable, drop me a line, let me know how your life has been. I hope you will say: It has been so wonderful.

Congratulations, Class of 2013. I wish you great happiness, all the luck in the world, and a beautiful summer.

I am deeply honored to be here with you all. I bring you special greetings from the Class of 1960. President Higdon, members of the Board of Trustees, my faculty colleagues, the wonderful staff of the college, the families of the graduates, and friends, and especially, the Class of 2011, it is a deep privilege to be here with you.

I was here early this morning – very early this morning – for an exceptional presentation, and really, for me, an exceptional, eye-opening and mind-expanding event, which meant I was at Connecticut College. I was with the students in Professor Tristan Borer’s class. They had done the research and then took the voices of diverse women around the world who together create what we might call world politics. But these are not women that you usually read about; they certainly aren’t women whose voices are usually heard; they never get the microphone. And yet the students, the very smart, engaged, thoughtful, committed students in Tristan Borer’s class, many of them right here in the graduating class – as well as juniors as well – managed to think deeply, think with nuance, and be creative. They managed to connect with women they didn’t know; they managed to connect with women whom they knew were part of their world.

Making connections is oftentimes talked about as if it’s reassuring. If you feel reassured, if you feel comfortable, you probably haven’t really made a connection. A connection should probably make you feel a little uneasy. Because if you make a connection it means you’re beginning to take responsibility for that person’s life. It means that that person is somehow affecting your life, but you’re also affecting their life.

I was thinking about connections a lot when I thought about our connection – everybody here, whether you’re a graduating senior, or you’re an alum, or you’re a family member, or if you’re a member of the Board of Trustees – everybody here is connected with the pioneering women and men from Hartford and New London who created this amazing institution. And I began thinking about them, and I began thinking about the month in which Connecticut
College was formally chartered by the legislature of the state of Connecticut; that would have been April 1911.

Now, probably some of you – especially if you’re from New York City, or maybe you just watch American Experience on PBS, or maybe you’re interested in labor history – some of you know that 1911 was a year of eventfulness; not all of it happy. Two weeks before Connecticut College received its official founding charter on March 25, 1911, it was a sunny day; it was kind of early spring in New York City, on the Lower East Side. In fact it was so warm on March 25, 1911, that a lot of people decided that they would come out and picnic in Washington Square, down in Greenwich Village. But the weekend had not yet been invented. You know, the weekend is an invention. The weekend is an invention of the labor movement. You’ve seen the bumper stickers, “If you’re enjoying your weekend, thank the labor movement.” Well, the weekend had not yet been invented in 1911. So, just a street away hundreds of workers were at work that sunny Saturday in March 1911, at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Now the shirtwaist had become very fashionable. It was a blouse that looked modern; it could be tucked into a long skirt, but a skirt that was daringly just above the ankle. And this really became – the shirtwaist with its long skirt – became for many women their ticket to modernity. Because if you wore the shirtwaist, this handsome white blouse in many styles, tucked into a not terribly long skirt, it meant you could move around the city. It meant that you could take a job and you could get paid for the work you did (That’s a radical idea for women, “Did you get paid for the work you do?”) and it was worn by women of all classes in 1911, and in fact, I just saw a photograph of women working at the Triangle Shirt Factory, and many of them who were sewing those shirtwaist white blouses, were in fact, wearing them. And then I also saw the wonderful calendar commemorating 1911, which is the calendar of 2011 for Connecticut College, and it showed President Sykes and the Secretary of the College with the first thirteen faculty members – seven women and six men – and I counted at least four shirtwaists being worn for this formal photograph – because these were modern women; these were women who dared to think that they might be professors. What a daring thing to think when state legislatures and members of Congress said that you weren’t rational enough to cast a vote, and yet you are daring to think that you could be a faculty member, armed with your shirtwaist. So, there they were, these hundreds of men and women in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. The factory was – the building – was ten stories high. Triangle was the biggest shirt maker in the country at the time – shirtwaist maker. It would be the Nike of today, and Triangle had the top three floors, the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth floor. And the women there spoke multiple languages; most of them, as are garment workers today in North America, most of them were relatively new immigrants, so the languages that they spoke to each other – at least when the supervisor wasn’t around telling them not to talk – were Yiddish, Irish, Polish, Italian. They were looking forward to their one day off, Sunday. They were looking forward to their paychecks, which would have been five dollars for a fifty-hour week. Not five dollars an hour; five dollars for a fifty-hour week. And then somebody on the eighth floor – we now know because we have wonderful historians doing this work – somebody carelessly tossed a cigarette that wasn’t fully extinguished into a wastebasket on the eighth floor.

There were very few rules about safety conditions in any kind of factory in the United States in 1911, so there were mounds of cloth; there were piles of paper from patterns stacked all around the factory floor. The fire spread. It spread so fast. People down in the park said later they looked up from their picnics and all of a sudden they saw smoke billowing out of the top floors of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. The women and men who worked on the eighth floor managed to get down the stairways. The people who worked, including the owners, up on the tenth floor, managed to scramble up to the roof and then to jump to a nearby building’s roof and to escape. But the women and men on the ninth floor went to their doors and they found that the managers had locked them. They’d locked them because the managers presumed that workers were thieves and were probably trying to steal cloth out of the factory. A hundred and forty-six Triangle Shirtwaist Factory employees died from that fire on March 25, 1911: twenty-three men and a hundred and twenty-three women. Many of them died as they tried to jump out of the ninth-story windows in desperation when they realized the doors were locked and the flames were spreading.

Now, up here in New London and in Hartford and many of the towns you come from, there were headlines. This was the worst industrial fire, so far, in American industrial history. There were headlines and they were read here, probably in the New London Day, and women who wore work shirtwaists began to think “Well, where do they come from? At what risk was my fashionable, functional, shirtwaist making me a modern woman? Who made that? At what risk?” There’ve always been connections between labor and education, between gender and class, but actually thinking about the connections, and thinking about our own connectedness, should make us uneasy because it brings a sense of responsibility.

This morning – it was very early – but I thought I should do a little research and my research was looking at the labels on my own clothes for today. My robe, it turns out, was made in Canada. My guess is it was made by new immigrant women, who would be Somali women, Filipino women, in Canada, probably in Winnipeg, or on Spadina Street, if any of you know Toronto. My other clothes today were made in Portugal – or let’s put it more directly – were made by workers who are Portuguese, workers in the Dominican Republic, and workers in Honduras.

My guess is that when you take off your robes and change your clothes – so you can clean out your rooms – you take a look at your labels, and my guess is here today we are connected with Chinese garment workers, with Vietnamese sneaker workers, with garment workers and textile workers in Mexico, Bangladesh, Romania, Cambodia. But being connected means that we have to take action. The first action is to be curious; to never put on a piece of clothing without curiosity, without thinking, “What kind of risks are the people taking so that I can have an affordable shirt? What kinds of doors are locked in the factories that make my sneakers or my fashionable sandals?”

So, to all of you who are graduating today, may you thrive. May every one of you thrive, and you’re going to thrive in many different ways. But may you thrive in a way that enhances the justice, and the safety, and the dignity of every person who has made the clothes that you are wearing today.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you very much. What an honor. Maureen, I want to take this opportunity, as you being the chairman of the board, to tell you that my oldest daughter, who is now a senior at Sacred Heart Academy in New Orleans, will be coming up here and attending Williams next fall. I’m sorry, I’m sorry; I still can’t get this right—my daughter, who is now a senior at Sacred Heart Academy in New Orleans, will be coming up here to attend Smith in the fall. I still can’t get it—my daughter, who is a senior at the Academy of Sacred Heart, will be coming up here to attend Hobart this fall.

All right, thank you, thank you for that correction. What a great day. I just love this. I thought about my graduation day, and I met a young man last night, Steven Miguel. Steven where are you? Stand up. It may not look like we have anything in common, but we do, because on my graduation and on his graduation we both had a 3.95. That’s his grade point average, and that was my blood alcohol level. You historians here know I finished college in four terms: Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford.

Well I come from New Orleans where we like to say half of our city is under water and the other half is under indictment. You notice my cap. And it’s a fleur-de-lis, which is the symbol of our city, and a tassel from Hobart and a tassel from William Smith. I wear this cap in appreciation of the bonds between the Colleges and the city of New Orleans. Hobart and William Smith students took eight trips, totaling 20 hours one way—that’s 320 hours of driving—to volunteer to help rebuild our beloved city. So, I wear this cap at your commencement in appreciation of the work and the bond between our two cities. And every time that I think that my child will be up here, I know that part of New Orleans will be with her and for that, I am grateful.

You know, as wonderful as these Colleges are, and the wonderful history of Hobart in 1822 and William Smith in 1901, and being one of the colleges that are rising the fastest, and the 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio, along with all the overseas work, this is really not a speech about the Colleges. This here is a wonderful president, and all the things that he’s done—and we’ve been dear friends for a long, long time—it’s not about that. It’s not about anything. It’s about you.

And because it’s your day, I’m going to level with you; it’s rough out there. It’s really rough. You’re leaving here, and I can sit here and tell you all the vapid bull that comes out of the spring air in Upstate New York about being un-tethered, and drifting out on the sea of life, and plan your work and work your plan and all of that SPAT! You’re getting ready to go get knocked down. That’s what’s going to happen. Everybody wants to be a success but no one wants to stop and understand what it takes to succeed. What it takes to succeed is to understand that failure is part of the process. There is no success without failure. There is no success without multiple failures, I promise you that. It’s not easy. You’re not just competing with people from other colleges like this, or Ivy League colleges, or big state universities or anything else, you’re competing with people from China and Japan and Thailand and India and Brazil and Mexico and Africa and all over the world. And you’re not going to get everything you want, and it’s not going to happen on the first time.

I’ll tell you a story. Do you know who the greatest failure in American history was—bar none?

Right there, on the five—Lincoln.

First off, he failed as a businessperson—he was a shopkeeper and that went down. He failed as a farmer. He ran for state legislature—lost. His sweetheart died, and he had a nervous breakdown. When he finally got to the state legislature he ran for speaker and lost. He ran for Congress and lost. He was rejected for a job as a land officer. He ran for United States Senate—he lost. God needs a new political consultant, I’ll tell you that. He ran for vice president and lost. He ran for senate again and lost. Then, when he finally got elected as president, the country he was elected to lead fell apart. Then he went out and lost the First Battle of Manassas, the Battle of Big Bethel, Kessler’s Cross Lanes, Blackmon Fort, McDowell, Winchester, Port Republic, Drewry’s Bluff, Gaines Mill, Cedar Mountain, Bristoe Station—he didn’t care he kept going. He lost Harper’s Ferry and Shepherdstown. He fired generals. By the way, Mary Todd Lincoln wasn’t exactly Mary Herlihy, she was, like, prone to depression and a spendthrift and God knows what not. Then after he wins the war and passes the 13th amendment, he gets shot. But my point is this: DUCK! My point is this: it’s hard. And I wish I could tell my daughter, and I wish I could tell all of ya’ll how it’s all just going to be wonderful. It is, in the end, because you know that.

Thomas Edison, who wasn’t exactly a piker himself, said the following: “Our greatest weakness is giving up. The most certain way to success is to try one more time.”

So if you’ve done 12 job interviews and you still don’t have the job you want, then go do 13. And then 14. Give it a try and keep going. You talk about the great scientists of the world, how many times do experiments fail? Does a thesis not work out? For every brilliant discovery there is, there’s a gazillion failures behind it. So, understand that. That’s what you deserve.

One day, some time ago, when my soon-to-be William Smith freshman was a little girl—and these things are hard, these speeches, you put a lot of thought into them—I was giving a speech to some young people and I wanted to give them some inspiration. I was lying in bed and you think a lot, and kids, they listen to ya know, Winnie the Pooh—Tigger and Piglet and that whole operation out there. The 100 Acre Wood or whatever it was. So I’m sitting there thinking what am I going to tell these young people? And I heard, what’s his name? Charles Robert or something, Christopher Rob—whatever, the human figure—and Winnie was afraid about something he had to do and he looked at him and said, “Ya know, you’re stronger than you seem, you’re braver than you believe, and you’re smarter than you think.”

In your life there are going to be times when you’re walking into a job interview, in your life there are going to be times when you’re arguing a case, in your life there are going to be times when you are taking oral exams, you’re going to be doing things and you are going to be scared. It’s natural. Everybody is. And when that happens, and it’s going to happen more than once, do me a favor: go back to the days of your childhood, go in the 100 Acre Wood, take a deep breath and just say, “I’m stronger than I seem, I’m braver than I believe, and I’m smarter than I think.” And then go do it, that’s what it is.

Now, I’ve given you my honest appraisal of what I think this is about and I’m going to close with a story because that’s what we do down south, we tell a lot of stories. I’ve got more stories on this kind of stuff than Obama has on Benghazi. This is a true story, unlike most of my stories.

About six months ago, I have a friend of mine. A legendary – I’ll say his name, Mike Hurley – he’s a legendary CIA; he’s retired now, he was a legendary CIA agent, and we were doing some work together in Columbia, in Bogota. He looks at me and says, “James, do you like President Bush Sr.?” And I said, “Yeah I like him, everybody kinda likes President Bush Sr.” And he says, “So you really like him?” And I said, “Yeah, I really like him. I’ve met him a number of times and I’ve actually gone to Texas A&M, I’ve spoken at his library, I actually did a commencement speech at Texas A&M that he asked me to do—he’s a cool guy.” He says, “Yeah, I like him too.” He said, “Ya know, in the CIA you’re attached to the Embassy.” I said, “Yeah, I knew that.” He said, “In 1989, I was at the French Embassy and it was the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. And President Bush was there, and so they got the Embassy personnel up and he gave a little talk and he said, ya know, it’s really nice that the Ambassador of France has a house that the Rothschilds had given to the U.S. government— it’s gorgeous; it’s nicer than the White House – and he cracked some jokes about it. And he said when he left, he was going to Holland, to the Netherlands. So everybody’s sitting there thinking here you are, it’s the 200th anniversary of France and you’re leaving to go to Holland? To the Netherlands? Everybody was saying what is that about? So actually somebody asked him: ‘Mr. President, president of the United States, why are you going to Holland?’ He said, “Ya know that’s a good question; I’ll tell you why I’m going. The first country to ever recognize the government of the United States was Holland. The house of John Adams, who was our first ambassador we ever appointed anywhere, still exists in Amsterdam. You know, no president has ever been there and I thought just because I was in the neighborhood I would go by and thank him.””

You are going to do remarkable things in your life. You have an unbelievable education, you don’t fear failure, you’re not intimidated, you’re going to have great self-confidence, you’re going to rise up and you’re going to do wonderful things. And ya know, when you do them, this is what I want you to do for me: I want you to remember the Holland in your life. It might be a teacher, a coach, a neighbor, a cleric—I don’t care. And when you’ve ascended these great heights and done these great things, I want you to go back, they might even be in a nursing home by then—you don’t know. But I want you to think about them and I want you to go see them. I want you to drop by and say, “Ya know, I’ve come a long way in life and I just wanted to tell you that you had something to do with that.” And then, when you achieve that, I want you to find your own young version of the United States and help them, and mentor them, and bring them along and show them recognition so they can grow too. That’s what this is about. You’re going to do it, you’re going to do the great stuff—total confidence in that. You’re going to get beat up along the way—total confidence in that. But always remember, there is only one definition of a champion, only one, and the true champion is the one who gets up one more time than they’re knocked down.

Thank ya’ll.

To all of today’s graduates, I can’t imagine what’s going through your minds right now. I never had the opportunity to go to a great university like this. I didn’t get here today like you did — by studying hard and excelling in school. Yet here I stand before you at this amazing crossroads in your life. So the question of the hour is what can I teach you? How can I help you even in the slightest way to be ready for whatever comes next?

So I asked myself, how did I get here?

After a lot of thought, I realized there have been two life lessons that changed everything about me. These were moments that shook me, scared me and humbled me. In the end, these moments are two big reasons I am here today. And since my education came in the music business, you may recognize some of the names and think, how can this guy’s stories possibly apply to me? Yet I truly believe these two experiences apply to absolutely anyone and anything you want to do in this journey called life.

Let’s start with something I learned when I was 23 — not much older than most of you guys. It’s been the subtext to whatever success I’ve had. I have tried to instill this lesson in everyone who works for me, and the ones who have learned it, are still working for me.

I started my career as a second recording engineer, which sounds fancy but the reality is that I answered phones, I cleaned the floors, and I made tea and coffee. That may not sound impressive, but it allowed me to learn my business from the ground up and it’s the kind of entry-level job that anybody starting a career should be happy to take. And it got me in the same building with John Lennon who, after the 50th cup of tea I served him, felt my enthusiasm and willingness to learn and allowed me to sit in on his sessions.

From there, I got the opportunity to work with Bruce Springsteen to help him record an album called Born to Run. Born to Run became a landmark album. If you don’t know it, ask your parents. But to my mother and father and their friends, Born to Run wasn’t Bruce Springsteen’s album — it was Jimmy Iovine’s album. They thought it was all about me. And before long, I began to believe that too.

So I was thrilled when Bruce and his manager and producer Jon Landau asked me to engineer the follow-up that eventually became Darkness on the Edge of Town. Back in those days, the first thing you did when making an album was record the drums. The job of getting the right drum sound fell to the recording engineer — and that was me. We spent six weeks working around the clock trying to get the sound that Bruce had in his head. And no matter what we did, it just wasn’t coming.

You cannot imagine everything we tried. We put the drums in the hallway. We put the drums in the elevator. We put the drums in the bathroom. We did everything but put the drums underwater. All I can remember is Bruce constantly saying to me, “Jimmy, I hear the stick hitting the drum.” At a certain point, I looked at him, and said, “Bruce, it is a stick hitting a drum!” But he was “The Boss” and that didn’t satisfy him. We were stuck. The sound I was getting was clunk-clunk-clunk and the sound Bruce wanted was boom-boom-boom.

So eventually, Bruce suggested bringing in some other guy from New Jersey of all places who could help me get this elusive drum sound. And I thought, “Why do I need help? What am I, half as good as I was two years ago?” To me, it sounded like a massive vote of no confidence. After six weeks of putting a microphone everywhere you could possibly imagine, I felt humiliated. I felt embarrassed. To use a word I hear way too often from 20-year-olds who work at my company, I felt disrespected. I felt so disrespected I wanted to suggest one more place Bruce could put that microphone.

I went back to the hotel where we were all staying, and I told Jon Landau, “I quit, I’ve done nothing but support this guy, and now he’s embarrassing me.” Looking back, I was just a beginner in the record-making process, but in the arrogance of my Brooklyn youth, I felt as if I had already arrived — that I knew everything. Boy, was I wrong.

Bruce’s manager looked me straight in the eye, and said, “Hang on, Jimmy, I’m going to tell you something that will go against every instinct you have about how to react in a situation like this: 

"This is not about you" Then Bruce’s manager said: “I want you to understand something called ‘The Big Picture.’ I’d never heard about this Big Picture. In my mother’s house, I was The Big Picture.”

Bruce’s manager continued: “And at a moment like this, it’s not about how you feel, Jimmy. It’s about Bruce Springsteen and his album. That’s the big picture — not your feelings, or anyone’s feelings.”

Inside, I had absolutely no idea what Jon meant. I wanted to scream. I wanted to argue. I wanted to walk. But for reasons I’m still thinking about three decades later, I did the opposite. I didn’t protect my ego. Instead, I paused for just a moment and listened to someone who might actually know better. So I told Jon, “You got it” because I did want to learn and this advice sounded like Aristotle to me. I had no idea who Aristotle was, but I liked the sound of his name. Jon told me, “I want you to walk in that room and tell Bruce Springsteen, ‘ “I am here to support you. I will do whatever you need me to do.’ ”

So that’s what I did.

Turned out, the other guy from Jersey couldn’t get the drums right either. Somehow we got closer to the sound Bruce wanted and we moved on together. Six weeks later, not only was I still on Bruce’s team, but he also gave me one of the greatest songs he ever wrote called “Because The Night” that I produced for Patti Smith. That was my first hit record as a producer and launched my career. Listening to Jon’s five words — “This is not about you” — became the tipping point for every gift that’s followed in my life.

At that moment, I began to learn how to push aside my own personal issues and my desperate need to be right so I could focus on what was truly important — the greater good. Don’t worry, I wasn’t cured — I still battle with these issues of insecurity, ego, pride and especially fear every day. Too often those issues get in the way of me seeing the “Big Picture.” But what I have learned is some of these powerful insecurities can be harnessed into life’s greatest motivator, the strongest five-hour energy drink ever. It’s called a little old fashioned fear.

I know about fear.

I was once fired from two jobs within 90 days. I felt as if the sidewalk was collapsing behind me, but that insecure feeling always kept me moving forward. Rather than stop me in my tracks like a headwind, I began to learn how to make those same insecurities the tailwinds to propel me forward.
Okay, now let’s fast-forward a little bit … maybe 30 years.

My second pivotal life lesson came in 1999, and now I was feeling like the king of the world. I had built the hottest record company in the world, Interscope Records, the home of great artists like Dr. Dre, No Doubt, Eminem, The Black Eyed Peas and we had just signed U2. We were on a roll. We felt invincible. Nothing could touch us.

Except … Napster.

As a founder of Interscope Records, a company built on people paying for music, I was instantly scared to death. My God-given insecurities kicked in again. See I grew up in Brooklyn, so I knew the difference between going to a store and paying for something, and the opportunity to get it for free. I felt this stealing thing could really catch on.

So I went to see one of founding guys at Intel named Les Valdez. Somehow I thought I could reason with the industry that was about to destroy mine.

Fear, at times, makes us protect and defend what we think we already know. But sometimes in life, you need to learn a new lesson. And between you and me, in my experience, the most intelligent people that I meet are the ones who can best articulate what they don’t know. That’s not what I did with Les that day. I just kept trying to tell him how I thought things should be.

After listening to me for 20 minutes, Les finally spoke. He looked me in the eye, and said, “Wow, Jimmy, what a nice story. But you know what? Not every industry was made to last forever.” That statement was so profound and so true and so insightful and — to me — so devastating, I nearly retired right there and then. I walked into Les’ office thinking I was Elvis, and I was gently reminded Elvis was dead.

The lesson Les taught me is one I believe is increasingly important to learn in the fast-changing world we live in today. Think about this:

Everything you know could already be wrong.

When I got outside Les’ office and stopped sweating, I called my buddy Doug Morris, the chairman of Universal Music and my boss at the time. I said, “Doug, we’re screwed.” Okay, I might not have used that exact word, but hey, I was upset. I said: “Doug, these guys don’t want our land. They want our water to take back to their land.”

At that moment, I was scared to death. In fact, at this moment, I am scared to death speaking in front of all you people. But I want you all to get comfortable with your fears because fear is a fact of life that you can use to your advantage. Because when you learn to harness the power of your fears, it can take you places beyond your wildest dreams. Because here’s the good news: Fear has a lot of firepower.

I’ve spent my life working with many of my heroes and maybe some of yours too. From John Lennon and Bruce to Bono, Eminem. And let me tell you, I never met a great artist who wasn’t afraid of not living up to people’s expectations. But all of the greats used their fear to inspire them. I think today of the way John Lennon broke ground by speaking of his fears and his belief in change in a song called “Working Class Hero.”

As John sang,

When they’ve tortured and scared you for 20-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can’t really function you’re so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be

John was a guy who could really express his fears and conquer them.

In the music business back in 2003, we were standing at a crossroads. We could desperately defend the past and keep digging the same hole, or we could open our eyes to the future. Trust me, it’s a lot harder to change directions at 55 than at 25 — and I think your parents will vouch for me. Les inspired me that day to go find my way in a music business that was evolving. The old model was changing. So I began to think that maybe there was some way to harness the culture of the old music industry in a whole new way.

Around that time, I was lucky enough to get to know Steve Jobs from Apple. I was representing Universal Music dealing with iTunes. After three years of hanging around Steve and the team at Apple, I thought I could learn a lot from these guys. They were breaking new ground. They were changing the game. And they were winning.

I noticed how Steve took all the music and videos from the world and built a beautiful shiny white thing called the iPod to play them on. We loved this shiny little white thing. The only part my friend Dr. Dre and I didn’t like were the shiny white ear buds that came with the shiny white iPod because they sounded terrible, sound wasn’t Apple’s focus. So we thought what if we make a beautiful shiny black thing so you can properly hear what’s in Steve’s shiny little white thing? So with my friend Dr. Dre, there we had the beginning of Beats. It wasn’t that simple, but you get the idea.

I learned even at 50, I had to be a beginner again
— and that’s as Zen-like a statement as you’ll ever hear from me. So who believed that Dr. Dre and I could sell hardware? No one. But we believed in ourselves. We harnessed our fear into power and turned it into action.
Today each one of you have an excellent reason to believe in yourselves. You’ve earned a degree from USC. You are graduating from one of the greatest universities in the world. Remember when you grew up hearing about people that are privileged? Congratulations you are now officially privileged. Because you know what privileged means — it means you have an edge. And whatever your background, wherever you come from, you now have the undeniable edge of a first-class education.

But please remember this: Your diploma does not represent the end of your education, but the beginning of your continuing education. Continue to listen and learn, with humility not hubris. Because that diploma you hold in your hands today is really just your learner’s permit for the rest of the drive through life. Remember, you don’t have to be smarter than the next person, all you have to do is be willing to work harder than the next person.

So now, that you’ve heard the stories that changed my life, it’s time for an announcement we hope will change some lives for the better in the future here at USC. Walking around USC today, it seems everyone’s a doctor. Which is funny because I brought my partner today who also happens to be a doctor. So in the words of Slim Shady, will the real Dr. Dre please stand up and join me onstage?

Dre: USC! Great to be back in my hood — up to some good. Congratulations to the graduating Class of 2013!

Iovine: At Beats, Dre and I have found it really difficult to find kids with an education that encompasses technology, the arts and innovation. So with USC, we’re creating a brand new program right here. It’s called the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy of Art, Technology and the Business of Innovation.

The class of 2013 is among the first in history to have grown up in our new world where the distinctions between the arts and technology are disappearing So Dre and I are teaming with this great institution to create a new kind of academy to address this reality. We want to do our part to prepare more brilliant students to do great and unexpected things.

What we need are schools — dream factories — that are broad enough to inspire, challenge and satisfy the curiosity of the next wave of game-changers that have a feel for technology and the liberal arts. That’s what we plan to do right here at USC.

In closing, because I believe in people doing the unexpected and being innovative, I would like to try something that’s never been done at a major graduation ceremony. Rather than quote William Shakespeare or Robert Frost, I close with the words of my favorite poet, R. Kelly, who penned my personal karaoke anthem. So let tonight be the reward for all of your hard work, and the “ignition” to a continuing education of the rest of your lives:

Today is your remix to ignition
You’re hot and fresh out the kitchen
You got the entire student body here
You got every graduate here wishin’
Parents they might be sippin’ on coke and rum
And they might even get a little drunk
So what, it’s their USC graduation baby
And tonight they’re gonna have some fun!

So have a fun weekend and a great life and especially a great night!

I recently turned thirty, which I know seems like a generation away to those of you graduating this morning. But it's more than just the worst. Thirty is a year where you're left straddling two worlds. One foot stands in the world of the young, among the bright eager minds and supple bodies of students like you. And the other foot stands in the world of the grey and decrepit; the ancient shapes of your professors and parents; their dulling senses; their craggily, wizened faces.

And by the way, congratulations parents! This is your day too.

But what it means is that I am in a position to talk about life after college -- as someone who just lived through it. For example, do you remember how your elementary school felt enormous? But then when you returned years later, you were amazed by how small it actually was? In time, your chosen professions will feel exactly the same way. That is not to say that you won't have almost unlimited opportunities. But it is to say that if you sleep with someone who works in your industry, just be aware that you're going to bump into that person at meetings and conferences and birthday parties for the rest of your life. I literally had to leave politics.Yeah, we're going to talk about it. Your love is a delicate flower.

So, I'm going to skip the platitudes, OK? I want this to be a practical commencement address. And I'm going to do my best to tell the truth -- even when it's uncomfortable to say, even when I probably shouldn't say it. Because you're already swimming in half-truths, in people telling you what they think you want to hear. And in this next phase of your life, I promise you, you will encounter more.

I should preface this by saying that the problem I am going to describe involves a bad word -- not the worst word, but a bad word -- though I've made sure that I only have to say it now and then one more time at the end. So if you want to distract any little kids for a second, please do so. One of the greatest threats we face is, simply put, bullshit. We are drowning in it. We are drowning in partisan rhetoric that is just true enough not to be a lie; in industry-sponsored research; in social media's imitation of human connection; in legalese and corporate double-speak. It infects every facet of public life, corrupting our discourse, wrecking our trust in major institutions, lowering our standards for the truth, making it harder to achieve anything.

And it wends its way into our private lives as well, changing even how we interact with one another: the way casual acquaintances will say "I love you"; the way we describe whatever thing as "the best thing ever"; the way we are blurring the lines between friends and strangers. And we know that. There have been books written about the proliferation of malarkey, empty talk, baloney, claptrap, hot air, balderdash, bunk. One book was aptly named "Your Call is Important to Us."

But this is not only a challenge to our society; it's a challenge we all face as individuals. Life tests our willingness, in ways large and small, to tell the truth. And I believe that so much of your future and our collective future depends on your doing so. So I'm going to give you three honest, practical lessons about cutting the BS.

Number one: Don't cover for your inexperience. You are smart, talented, educated, conscientious, untainted by the mistakes and conventional wisdom of the past. But you are also very annoying. Because there is a lot that you don't know that you don't know. Your parents are nodding. You've been annoying them for years. Why do you think they paid for college? So that you might finally, at long last, annoy someone else. And now your professors are nodding.

F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, "Yeah, this should definitely be in 3D."

No, what he said was, "[T]he test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function." That's what you have to do: you have to be confident in your potential, and aware of your inexperience. And that's really tough. There are moments when you'll have a different point of view because you're a fresh set of eyes; because you don't care how it's been done before; because you're sharp and creative; because there is another way, a better way. But there will also be moments when you have a different point of view because you're wrong, because you're 23 and you should shut up and listen to somebody who's been around the block.

The old people are nodding again.

It's hard to tell the difference. Me, I love getting this one wrong. I got it wrong a ton when I started out as a speechwriter to Hillary Clinton. I got it wrong again when I became a presidential speechwriter. I worked on one speech about the financial system that caused the Dow to drop like 200 points. So that speech could have been better, probably.

Just this past year, I faced this same dilemma, co-creating a show on NBC. It's called 1600 Penn, and while you may have heard of it, based on the ratings, you almost certainly didn't see it. Though, it did recently make some headlines... when it was cancelled. I had never so much as a written a line of dialogue before I wrote this show. But I'm working with directors and writers and executives with years and years of experience in the biz. We call it the biz.

I'll always cringe remembering those little embarrassing moments when I said something dumb on a conference call, when my inexperience poked through, when I should have been more solicitous of the judgment of those around me. They're a reminder that it's not mutually exclusive to be confident and humble; to be skeptical and eager to learn.

But there is another side to this coin, which brings me to lesson number two: Sometimes you're going to be inexperienced, naïve, untested and totally right. And then, in those moments, you have to make a choice: is this a time to speak up, or hang back? I worked for then-Senator Clinton during her campaign for president -- and I believed in her, still do. But I vividly remember feeling like things weren't right in that campaign; a lot of the young staffers felt that way -- it wasn't a secret that there were problems in how the campaign was run. The campaign pollster for example, rolled out so many slogans it was impossible to keep track. Here's a sample:


Let the Conversation Begin

Ready for Change, Ready to Lead

Working for Change, Working for You

Strength + Experience = Change. Which leads to the lesser known corollary: ( Strength + Experience ) / Change = 1.

And then, my favorite: Big Challenges, Real Solutions: Time to Pick a President. Which he had printed on the side of a bus but it was basically too small to read.

So, I'm putting these slogans into speeches and I look over at an Obama campaign rally on cable news and they have one slogan. It's just the word "CHANGE" in big letters. That seemed better. But I was timid; and a lot of us just assumed, or wanted to assume, that more experienced people must know what they're doing. But that wasn't true. So the campaign ended, my candidate lost, and I ended up as a presidential speechwriter anyway, which was cool. But the lesson I drew from that campaign, other than the fact that it's always a mistake to run against Barack Obama, is the subway rule: "If you see something, say something." And I've tried to honor that ever since; to call BS when I see it -- and to not be afraid to get in people's faces, and throw a punch or two, to make a point. Metaphorically. Look at me. I wouldn't do well in an altercation.

Now, lessons one and two can be in tension. And I can't tell you how to strike the balance every time. Though it helps to be very charming. And from my point of view, I'd rather be wrong and cringe than right and regret not speaking up. But the good news is, as long as you aren't stubbornly wrong so frequently that they kick you out of the building, or so meek that everyone forgets you're in the building you'll learn and grow and get better at striking that balance, until your inexperience becomes experience. So it's a dilemma that solves itself. How awesome is that?


Finally, number three: Know that being honest -- both about what you do know, and what you don't -- can and will pay off.

Up until recently, I would have said that the only proper response to our culture of BS is cynicism; that it would just get worse and worse. But I don't believe that any more, and I think this matters for what comes next for you. I think we may have reached a critical turning point.

I'm going to say that word one last time. I believe we may have reached "peak bullshit." And that increasingly, those who push back against the noise and nonsense; those who refuse to accept the untruths of politics and commerce and entertainment and government will be rewarded. That we are at the beginning of something important.

We see it across our culture, with not only popularity but hunger for the intellectual honesty of Jon Stewart or the raw sincerity of performers like Louis CK and Lena Dunham. You can even add the rise of dark, brooding, "authentic" super heroes in our blockbuster movies. We see it in locally-sourced, organic food on campuses like this, at places like the Shakedown, a rejection of the processed as inauthentic. We see it in politics.

I believe Barack Obama represents this movement, that the rise of his candidacy was in part a consequence of the desire for greater authenticity in our public life. But you don't have to be a Democrat to believe me. You see it across the political spectrum, from Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts to Chris Christie in New Jersey to Rand Paul in Kentucky.

And what's awesome is that you -- the graduates of schools like Pitzer -- will be the ones who are best prepared and most likely to lead this movement. What's striking about the culture of this school is an unabashedly sincere desire to do good in this world; to be responsible for one another and to carry yourselves with integrity. And it's exciting that, maybe -- just maybe -- those traits won't just mean you do good; that this earnestness, this authenticity, will help you succeed in a society that is demanding those qualities with both hands.

All you have to do is avoid BSing yourself -- in whatever you choose to do. To avoid the path of the sad gay judge filled with regret. To go forward with confidence and an eagerness to learn. And to be honest with yourselves, and others -- to reject a culture of insincerity by virtue of the example you set in your own lives. And I say this only as someone hoping to do the same, along with you for the ride.

Pitzer Class of 2013, you don't need any more encouragement from me. Congratulations. And I can't wait to see what you do next.

A couple of weeks ago, I saw a stranger crying in public. I was in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood, waiting to meet a friend for breakfast. I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and was sitting on the bench outside, scrolling through my contact list. A girl, maybe 15 years old, was sitting on the bench opposite me, crying into her phone. I heard her say, “I know, I know, I know” over and over.

What did she know? Had she done something wrong? Was she being comforted? And then she said, “Mama, I know,” and the tears came harder.

What was her mother telling her? Never to stay out all night again? That everybody fails? Is it possible that no one was on the other end of the call, and that the girl was merely rehearsing a difficult conversation?

“Mama, I know,” she said, and hung up, placing her phone on her lap.

I was faced with a choice: I could interject myself into her life, or I could respect the boundaries between us. Intervening might make her feel worse, or be inappropriate. But then, it might ease her pain, or be helpful in some straightforward logistical way. An affluent neighborhood at the beginning of the day is not the same as a dangerous one as night is falling. And I was me, and not someone else. There was a lot of human computing to be done.

It is harder to intervene than not to, but it is vastly harder to choose to do either than to retreat into the scrolling names of one’s contact list, or whatever one’s favorite iDistraction happens to be. Technology celebrates connectedness, but encourages retreat. The phone didn’t make me avoid the human connection, but it did make ignoring her easier in that moment, and more likely, by comfortably encouraging me to forget my choice to do so. My daily use of technological communication has been shaping me into someone more likely to forget others. The flow of water carves rock, a little bit at a time. And our personhood is carved, too, by the flow of our habits.

Psychologists who study empathy and compassion are finding that unlike our almost instantaneous responses to physical pain, it takes time for the brain to comprehend the psychological and moral dimensions of a situation. The more distracted we become, and the more emphasis we place on speed at the expense of depth, the less likely and able we are to care.

Everyone wants his parent’s, or friend’s, or partner’s undivided attention — even if many of us, especially children, are getting used to far less. Simone Weil wrote, “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.” By this definition, our relationships to the world, and to one another, and to ourselves, are becoming increasingly miserly.

Most of our communication technologies began as diminished substitutes for an impossible activity. We couldn’t always see one another face to face, so the telephone made it possible to keep in touch at a distance. One is not always home, so the answering machine made a kind of interaction possible without the person being near his phone. Online communication originated as a substitute for telephonic communication, which was considered, for whatever reasons, too burdensome or inconvenient. And then texting, which facilitated yet faster, and more mobile, messaging. These inventions were not created to be improvements upon face-to-face communication, but a declension of acceptable, if diminished, substitutes for it.

But then a funny thing happened: we began to prefer the diminished substitutes. It’s easier to make a phone call than to schlep to see someone in person. Leaving a message on someone’s machine is easier than having a phone conversation — you can say what you need to say without a response; hard news is easier to leave; it’s easier to check in without becoming entangled. So we began calling when we knew no one would pick up.Shooting off an e-mail is easier, still, because one can hide behind the absence of vocal inflection, and of course there’s no chance of accidentally catching someone. And texting is even easier, as the expectation for articulateness is further reduced, and another shell is offered to hide in. Each step “forward” has made it easier, just a little, to avoid the emotional work of being present, to convey information rather than humanity.

The problem with accepting — with preferring — diminished substitutes is that over time, we, too, become diminished substitutes. People who become used to saying little become used to feeling little.

With each generation, it becomes harder to imagine a future that resembles the present. My grandparents hoped I would have a better life than they did: free of war and hunger, comfortably situated in a place that felt like home. But what futures would I dismiss out of hand for my grandchildren? That their clothes will be fabricated every morning on 3-D printers? That they will communicate without speaking or moving?

Only those with no imagination, and no grounding in reality, would deny the possibility that they will live forever. It’s possible that many reading these words will never die. Let’s assume, though, that we all have a set number of days to indent the world with our beliefs, to find and create the beauty that only a finite existence allows for, to wrestle with the question of purpose and wrestle with our answers.

We often use technology to save time, but increasingly, it either takes the saved time along with it, or makes the saved time less present, intimate and rich. I worry that the closer the world gets to our fingertips, the further it gets from our hearts. It’s not an either/or — being “anti-technology” is perhaps the only thing more foolish than being unquestioningly “pro-technology” — but a question of balance that our lives hang upon.

Most of the time, most people are not crying in public, but everyone is always in need of something that another person can give, be it undivided attention, a kind word or deep empathy. There is no better use of a life than to be attentive to such needs. There are as many ways to do this as there are kinds of loneliness, but all of them require attentiveness, all of them require the hard work of emotional computation and corporeal compassion. All of them require the human processing of the only animal who risks “getting it wrong” and whose dreams provide shelters and vaccines and words to crying strangers.

We live in a world made up more of story than stuff. We are creatures of memory more than reminders, of love more than likes. Being attentive to the needs of others might not be the point of life, but it is the work of life. It can be messy, and painful, and almost impossibly difficult. But it is not something we give. It is what we get in exchange for having to die.

sCommencement address—it’s going well, it’s going well. Thank you, Jeanine, for…making me do this.

This is going to be great. This is going to be a good one. It’s gonna go really well.

Two roads diverged in a wood, and… no. I’m not that lazy.

I actually sat through many graduations. When I was siting where you guys were sitting, the speaker was Bill Cosby—funny man Bill Cosby, he was very funny and he was very brief, and I thanked him for that. He gave us a message that I really took with me, that a lot of us never forgot, about changing the world. He said, “you’re not going to change the world, so don’t try.”

That was it. He didn’t buy that back at all. And then he complained about buying his daughter a car and we left. I remember thinking, “I think I can do better. I think I can be a little more inspiring than that.”

And so, what I’d like to say to all of you is that you are all going to die.

This is a good commencement speech because I’m figuring it’s only going to go up from here. It can only get better, so this is good. It can’t get more depressing. You have, in fact, already begun to die. You look great. Don’t get me wrong. And you are youth and beauty. You are at the physical peak. Your bodies have just gotten off the ski slope on the peak of growth, potential, and now comes the black diamond mogul run to the grave. And the weird thing is your body wants to die. On a cellular level, that’s what it wants. And that’s probably not what you want.

I’m confronted by a great deal of grand and worthy ambition from this student body. You want to be a politician, a social worker. You want to be an artist. Your body’s ambition: Mulch. Your body wants to make some babies and then go in the ground and fertilize things. That’s it. And that seems like a bit of a contradiction. It doesn’t seem fair. For one thing, we’re telling you, “Go out into the world!” exactly when your body is saying, “Hey, let’s bring it down a notch. Let’s take it down.”

And it is a contradiction. And that’s actually what I’d like to talk to you about. The contradiction between your body and your mind, between your mind and itself. I believe these contradictions and these tensions are the greatest gift that we have, and hopefully, I can explain that.But first let me say when I talk about contradiction, I’m talking about something that is a constant in your life and in your identity, not just in your body but in your own mind, in ways that you may recognize or you may not.

Let’s just say, hypothetically, that two roads diverged in the woods and you took the path less traveled. Part of you is just going, “Look at that path! Over there, it’s much better. Everyone is traveling on it. It’s paved, and there’s like a Starbucks every 40 yards. This is wrong. In this one, there’s nettles and Robert Frost’s body—somebody should have moved that—it just feels weird. And not only does your mind tell you this, it is on that other path, it is behaving as though it is on that path. It is doing the opposite of what you are doing. And for your entire life, you will be doing, on some level, the opposite—not only of what you were doing—but of what you think you are. That is just going to go on. What you do with all your heart, you will do the opposite of. And what you need to do is to honor that, to understand it, to unearth it, to listen to this other voice.

You have, which is a rare thing, that ability and the responsibility to listen to the dissent in yourself, to at least give it the floor, because it is the key—not only to consciousness-but to real growth. To accept duality is to earn identity. And identity is something that you are constantly earning. It is not just who you are. It is a process that you must be active in. It’s not just parroting your parents or the thoughts of your learned teachers. It is now more than ever about understanding yourself so you can become yourself.

I talk about this contradiction, and this tension, there’s two things I want to say about it. One, it never goes away. And if you think that achieving something, if you think that solving something, if you think a career or a relationship will quiet that voice, it will not. If you think that happiness means total peace, you will never be happy. Peace comes from the acceptance of the part of you that can never be at peace. It will always be in conflict. If you accept that, everything gets a lot better.

The other reason is because you are establishing your identities and your beliefs, you need to argue yourself down, because somebody else will. Somebody’s going to come at you, and whatever your belief, your idea, your ambition, somebody’s going to question it. And unless you have first, you won’t be able to answer back, you won’t be able to hold your ground. You don’t believe me, try taking a stand on just one leg. You need to see both sides.

Now, if you do, does this mean that you get to change the world? Well, I’m getting to that, so just chill. All I can say to this point is I think we can all agree that the world could use a little changing. I don’t know if your parents have explained this to you about the world but… we broke it. I’m sorry… it’s a bit of a mess. It’s a hard time to go out there. And it’s a weird time in our country.

The thing about our country is—oh, it’s nice, I like it—it’s not long on contradiction or ambiguity. It’s not long on these kinds of things. It likes things to be simple, it likes things to be pigeonholed—good or bad, black or white, blue or red. And we’re not that. We’re more interesting than that. And the way that we go into the world understanding is to have these contradictions in ourselves and see them in other people and not judge them for it. To know that, in a world where debate has kind of fallen away and given way to shouting and bullying, that the best thing is not just the idea of honest debate, the best thing is losing the debate, because it means that you learn something and you changed your position. The only way really to understand your position and its worth is to understand the opposite. That doesn’t mean the crazy guy on the radio who is spewing hate, it means the decent human truths of all the people who feel the need to listen to that guy. You are connected to those people. They’re connected to him. You can’t get away from it.

This connection is part of contradiction. It is the tension I was talking about. This tension isn’t about two opposite points, it’s about the line in between them, and it’s being stretched by them. We need to acknowledge and honor that tension, and the connection that that tension is a part of. Our connection not just to the people we love, but to everybody, including people we can’t stand and wish weren’t around. The connection we have is part of what defines us on such a basic level.

Freedom is not freedom from connection. Serial killing is freedom from connection. Certain large investment firms have established freedom from connection. But we as people never do, and we’re not supposed to, and we shouldn’t want to. We are individuals, obviously, but we are more than that.

So here’s the thing about changing the world. It turns out that’s not even the question, because you don’t have a choice. You are going to change the world, because that is actually what the world is. You do not pass through this life, it passes through you. You experience it, you interpret it, you act, and then it is different. That happens constantly. You are changing the world. You always have been, and now, it becomes real on a level that it hasn’t been before.

And that’s why I’ve been talking only about you and the tension within you, because you are—not in a clichéd sense, but in a weirdly literal sense—the future. After you walk up here and walk back down, you’re going to be the present. You will be the broken world and the act of changing it, in a way that you haven’t been before. You will be so many things, and the one thing that I wish I’d known and want to say is, don’t just be yourself. Be all of yourselves. Don’t just live. Be that other thing connected to death. Be life. Live all of your life. Understand it, see it, appreciate it. And have fun.”

I thank you for this warm introduction and the video accompaniment. I was just sitting in my office at that time, conducting a little Q&A with Time Magazine. It was just Times’ ten questions that had been asked by the public. They came in and they recorded it and it sat there for like five years.It was on the internet but just a few months ago someone attached visual imagery to it and soI think by doing so, greatly enhanced the video because you’re not just simply looking at me, you’re looking at the universe and of course the message is about the universe. So that video went viral. Thank you for sharing that for those who don’t yet own a computer.

I’m supposed to give some acceptance remarks and I thought to myself “You’re about to graduate.”so I can offer you some wisdom, perhaps that you might not have gotten yet in life. In the interest of disclosure, since I was born and raised inNew York City; I’m a Yankee fan. The difference is, in New York when the Red Sox come to town you can buy “Red Sox Sux” t-shirt but you can’t really by a “Red Sox Sux” t-shirt at any other time of the year. In Boston when it was mid-winter, there was snow on the ground and there was a whole display of the “Yankees Sucks” paraphernalia. The feelings are mutual but not all year round. That’s the only difference.

In college I used to wrestle and I want to thank the lighting designer of this room for leaving the one light on over the wrestling banner in the back of the room.

I just want to highlight a few things. I’m worried, really, about how much the fuzzy thinking is going on in the world. Fuzzy thinking is people just not thinking straight. I try to think hard about what is behind it. I reflect on the time with my sister, who is four years younger. I was a whole school ahead of here, when she was entering high school I was leaving high school.

One time I said, “Lynn, where do you want to go have lunch today?” She said, “Well, what are my choices?” It was odd because I didn’t realize until that moment that she was not yet capable of simply coming up with a fresh idea because she’d spent her whole lifetaking multiple-choice tests. So when I ask a question she wants choices in front of her to pick from.

This would continue throughout life. I tested this with other people. People want choices. I realized maybe it’s hard to just think originally and come up with a fresh thought that the person who’s offering the question hadn’t thought up yet.I think somehow in our society we are hell-bent on the answer, the right answer because when it’s the right answer it’s the right answer and when it’s the wrong answer it’s not the right answer.

Consider this following example.Imagine you have a spelling bee and you have to spell the word cat. One student spells it C-A-T and got it right. The next person spells it K-A-T. That’s wrong. The third person spells it X-Q-W. Do you realize that is marked equally as wrong as the K-A-T? You could argue that K-A-T is a better spelling for cat than C-A-T. Dictionaries know this because that’s how they spell it phonetically. So we’ve built a system for ourselves where there is an answer and everything else is not the answer even when some answers are better than others.

So our brains are absent of the wiring capable of coming up with an original thought or a thought not previously considered or a thought between the ideas that are already laid on the table. What we’re not valuing is knowledge as process rather than knowledge as an answer.

In another example, if you’re an employer and two candidates come up looking for a job and you’re interviewing the two candidates and you say“For part of this interview I just want to ask you, what’s the height of the spire on this building that were in?” and the candidate says “Well, I majored in architecture and I memorized the heights of all the buildings on Capitol Hill. I know that the height of the spire is 150 feet.” It turns out that is the right answer and the person came up with it in seconds. That person goes away and the next candidate walks in, “Do you know the height of the spire on this building?” The candidate says “No, but I’ll be right back.” The person runs outside and measures the length of the shadow of that spire on the ground, measures the length of his own shadow, ratios the height to the shadows and comes up with a number. He runs back inside, “It’s about 150 feet.” Who are you going to hire? I’m hiring the person who figured it out.

Even though it took that person longer, even though the person’s answer is not as precise, that person knows how to use the mind in a way not previously engaged. You realize when you know how to think, it empowers you far beyond those who know only what to think.

So many people can’t wait till school ends, can’t wait until the summer holidays. What are you in a hurry to do, to stop learning? This is the only time in your life when your job was to learn. That was your job. That’s what was expected of you. Now you’re being cast forth and I’m hoping,I’m expecting that you’re not saying to yourself “I’m done learning.” because if that’s how you think and feel you will slide back to the cave because everyone else who keeps learning will pass you by and that’s where you’ll end up even if you didn’t think you are headed there. This active learning tells me that as you exit this institution, this newly sanctioned university, just in time by the way, in astrophysics were working on the multiverse rather than the universe, so in a few years it might be called the multiversity. So just get ready.

Think of your graduation, think of this moment as the beginning of learning not the end of learning. If anyone gives you a choice say “Don’t even give me a choice let me think up an answer all by myself.” It’s once been said that there’s no greater pain to the human mind than the prospect of a new idea because old ideas bring comfort.

I want every single one of you to lead painful uncomfortable lives. In that pain and discomfort you’ll make discoveries that can transform this world in all the ways that it desperately needs. Thank you all for your time.

Ole Miss journalism and integrated marketing communications students and their families packed the Ford Center on Saturday, May 11.  Doing the honors as the keynote speaker was Sharyn Alfonsi, a 1994 journalism graduate from Ole Miss.  Alfonsi is now a correspondent for CBS’ “60 Minutes Sports,” which airs on Showtime.

Alfonsi’s speech delighted the crowd and offered advice on how to succeed with both life and making a living.

The following is a transcript of the speech; a video version is also included:

Dean Norton, parents, faculty and friends and graduates.  Good afternoon and congratulations. To be clear,  I know exactly why I was given the amazing opportunity to speak to you on such an important day.

It is not because of any impressive journalism awards; it’s not because you want to hear stories from war zones;  it is not even because of my terrific head of hair on an oppressively humid day.  I know the one and only reason I am here is because Shepard Smith was clearly not available.

Still, let me thank you for this tremendous honor. I graduated from Ole Miss with a degree in journalism, roughly 104 years ago today.

There was no journalism school at that time. It wasn’t a popular choice.

It was believed that the smart students went to the School of Pharmacy because clearly it takes a genius to count pills and hand out ointment for angry looking rashes.  Those who were especially talented pursued fine arts degrees because you need to spend  tens of thousands  on college before you can pursue your dream to make pottery.  And then there were the kids from the School of Engineering.   I actually didn’t ever hang out with anyone from that school, but neither did anyone else; you get the idea.

Still,  it was believed that journalism students were the misfits — the odd ones.  Looking at you all today,  and at this gorgeous new journalism school, I am delighted to see, nothing has changed.

It looks a little like Scooby Doo’s Mystery Van got lost and you all popped out the back.

I see the Velmas, sporting glasses or comfortable shoes,  with dreams of working at NPR or the Economist.

The  Freds, who hope their good looks and smart ascots might lead to a seat at the anchor desk at the local TV station.

And of course the Shaggys, those who spent a little too much time in the smoke-filled booth at “Rebel Radio,”  emerging only for “Scooby Snacks.”

Parents, if you fear your child is a Shaggy — and a tip off is they may be wearing flip flops or TEVAs today with their caps and gowns — don’t worry.    The good news is you will be seeing a lot of them.   They’ll be living in your basement for the next 10 years, emerging every time they have a problem with the Wi-Fi.

But I am here to deliver good news to you all today.   As you all know the economy is pumping,  high paying journalism jobs are everywhere and as a person who has lived in New York City for the last decade, I am delighted to report that the “Media Elite” have absolutely no preconceived notions about people from Mississippi.

And that story about the Elvis impersonator, who may or may not have been set up by a karate instructor, who may or may not have tried to poison the president, really helped things.

I am here to tell you everything I know.  So this should take roughly  23 seconds.

When I was applying for jobs my senior year, I sent my resume tape to two dozen television stations.   Most of them did not call or write back, but one news director did write back.   Here’s what he wrote — this is an excerpt from the actual letter:

Dear Ms. Alfonsi,

Thank you for your application for the news reporter position.  Unfortunately,  we have hired a qualified applicant.  (The word qualified was underlined).

I know you are beginning your career, so please allow me to give you a bit of feedback.

Your reporting skills show some promise however, you need a lot of work.   Your hair is too big, your accent too thick and overall, you look a little equine on camera. 

Now for those of you who didn’t catch that, he just called me equine.   He said I looked like a horse.  A horse.

He went on.

Best of luck with your career in television; I look forward to seeing more of your work.

And then he signed his name, which side note: looks like the writing of a serial killer.

Now, a normal person would have finished a bottle of Maker’s Mark and started filling out applications at the racetrack, but I was actually encouraged by this letter.  He said he wanted to see more of my work.

This leads me to my first piece of advice:  Do not take NO for an answer.

Not when you’re applying for jobs; not when you actually get a job.

People will tell you,  “No, were not hiring.”  “No,  I don’t want to do an interview with you.”  “No, you may not sleep on my porch and use my cat as a pillow until I change my mind.”

Keep pressing.  You are applying for work in journalism, not trying to get hired as a social secretary.  The people who may hire you respect grit.  They respect tenacity, and in my experience,  I have found they are generally unlikely to issue a restraining order.

If you, like me, were raised by a beautiful, genteel mother with exceedingly good manners, being pushy will make you wildly uncomfortable, but keep at it.     Prove that you want it.

The food court at the mall is littered with journalism students who didn’t fight for it.   Fight for it.

And if you somehow get an offer to do any job, no matter how small or insignificant in the field you want to work in, take it.     There is no job too small.

Yes, it is true, if you do the math (or since you’re a journalism graduate, if you have your roommate do the math) you would likely make more working at a Cracker Barrel than in your first job in journalism.

And if you worked at Cracker Barrel you get to eat your weight in delicious fried apples and get discounts on sock monkeys, but take the journalism job.   It will pay off, eventually.

You will never work harder;  you will never have more fun.  It will not be easy.  You will want to quit.   I’ve wanted to quit a dozen times over the last decade.

“Really?  I  have to come in at 2 am and turn a story for Good Morning America because Lindsay Lohan forgot her underpants…. again?

“Really?!  I’m eight months pregnant and there’s no one else at this entire network you can send to cover the hurricane?”

“Seriously,  After I spent  five hours in the driving rain covering the hurricane, you’re going to complain about my hair?!  Really?”

For every one of those crappy  days,  you’ll have ten great ones.

“Really, I’m going to the White House today?”

“Really,  I’m going to spend the day watching the Yale Crew team workout? And  I am getting paid for this? Fantastic!”

And while those great days may make you feel great, on top of the world almost,  you might even think,  “Hey, I’ve made it!”  and relax a little and  get comfortable.   Here’s my next piece of advice.

Don’t  get comfortable.   Ever.

I  recently got a job at  “60 Minutes Sports.”   The show is entirely produced and presented by the “60 Minutes” team you’re used to seeing every Sunday nigh, but it appears on Showtime so technically we could cuss.   I won’t.  But we could.   It is the job I always dreamed of.

Actually,  when I was little I dreamed of being Mrs. George Michael, but it became pretty clear when he married a man that wasn’t  a great option.   So, I set my sights on CBS, specifically “60 Minutes.”

I wanted to be a great reporter — not an anchor, a reporter.  In my mind,  Mike Wallace’s blistering interviews were art.    No one was cooler than Ed Bradley.    But I set my sights on “60 Minutes” after watching a young Meredith Viera go head to head with casino magnate Steve Wynn.  I can’t remember what she asked him, but he ripped off his mic and at one point threatened to strangle her.  It was delicious.  I knew in that moment, i wanted to do that — not get strangled,  the other part.

Working my way up the ladder in local news, news directors,  displaying bouts of seriously impaired judgment, offered me jobs to anchor the news.

For those of you who don’t know,  anchoring  in a local market generally  means you get more money, have some editorial control and best of all you’d get your face on the side of a bus or a billboard right  next to an advertisement for  check cashing or a gentleman’s club.   In a word,  prestige.

It would be a more comfortable life, I was sure.    But I had my eye on being a reporter and knew that anchoring would take me off the streets.  So, to the bewilderment of my bosses,  I passed the jobs up.

If you’re not too comfortable,  it’s always easier to leave,  to move on  and hopefully, move up.

So, now that I have my dream job, you’d think I might relax a little, get comfortable.  You’d be wrong.   See the thing is when you have your dream job, especially when people like Scott Pelley,  Leslie Stahl and  Morley Safer work down the hall,  you’re pretty sure you’re the admissions’ mistake.

I am fairly confident that I am.  This isn’t false modesty; it’s a fact.   I am not the smartest person who ever worked in a newsroom.  I don’t have an Ivy League pedigree or an exotic  accent that makes me sound worldly, but I am scrappy as hell, and in Journalism,  scrappy counts.

So dream big,  but work hard and believe me when I tell you this…there are no shortcuts.

I used to work for ABC News.    Disney owns ABC News,  in case you didn’t know.  When I arrived there they called me a quote, “cast member,” and  told me that I got special perks at the theme parks.

One of my colleagues later informed me that at Disney,  you can pay extra money to get  a pass that allows you,  essentially, to  get to the front of the lines for rides.

I found this appalling and then immediately asked,  “Where do I get one?”

But it turns out,  the thing is,  if you cut to the front of line,  you just don’t enjoy the ride as much.  Really.  You need to sweat with the masses.  You need to watch the weaker,  or perhaps wiser,  people who can’t handle it, quit.  It’s fun to make friends with people along the way.   Not the guy wearing an “I’m with Goofy” t-shirt and  bedazzled denim short, but the other people.

Along the way you will meet people you will never forget, characters like no other.  I can’t remember half the stories I did, but I remember just about every fantastic photographer or producer along the way.

They acted as my teachers,  my psychiatrists and often, my parole officers.  They still do.

One of my favorites, Danny Marotta, a veteran photographer from South Boston.  He fought in Vietnam and reminded me  whenever I got stressed,  “It’s just TV, pal; it’s just TV.”

Don’t take yourself too seriously.    No one else will.     You work in journalism.     You’re not performing heart surgery.

On a good day, you will tell somebody something they don’t know.  I have taxi drivers who do that regularly and they don’t get awards for it.

On a great day,  you’ll dig deeper, tell a story so well it gets attention,  changes  lives, policy or conversation.  Those days, I’m not going to lie, are golden.    Strive for them.

And  if you don’t know exactly how to do that right now,  don’t’ sweat it.

You have made your way through what I believe is honestly the of the best journalism schools in the county.  Still, most of the important lessons about journalism you have yet to learn.    Your professors are passing you on to a new set of teachers:    Newspaper editors with nicotine patches,  guys carrying a camera in one hand, and a Dunkin Donuts coffee in the other and office secretaries who know more than you’ll ever forget.

So listen to them,  be humble and  be nice to everyone.  It is great to have an important or interesting job  but I am telling you that in the long run, it is more important than almost anything  you do to be nice.

Now,  since we are  in the South,  and most people are already nice, I feel I should clarify.  Don’t confuse “nice” with what I call “stupid nice.”

“Nice” is carrying a tripod for a photographer whose already loaded down with equipment.

“Stupid nice’ is saying to him,  “Don’t worry you don’t need to carry a light kit too, I’m a natural beauty.”

“Nice” is congratulating a colleague when they did a good job.

“Stupid nice” is later saying to that same colleague,  “You did such a good  job; why don’t you just go ahead and  do this  interview with the president instead of me?”

Don’t be stupid nice.  Be nice. There will be days when this will take everything you’ve got.

I have met some honestly horrific people along the way,  awful, wretched individuals and right now I would like to take the opportunity to name each one of them.

Publicly.

(No one’s recording this, right?)

There was one senior producer  I worked for who was so nasty she went out of her way to try and make me miserable.   Often,  she succeeded.    She made me want to quit.

Then,  I remember something my father used to tell me before every track meet.

Well first,  he’d say,  “Make sure you tie your laces,  Einstein.”  Then, he’d say. “Ignore the competition and just run your race.’

Throughout your career people will try to distract you.  Some will scream at you,  others will say things behind your back,  and a few feral animals will  literally try to throw their stiletto heel in in your lane and trip you.    Keep your eyes straight ahead and just run your race.

Don’t worry what others are doing; they are nothing more than a distraction.  Drown out the critics.  Don’t engage in office politics or gossip.  Don’t worry about the guy next you.  Run your race.

Now, I am the first to admit I am a cautionary tale here.

I was running so hard,  working so much, I looked up one day and realized,  suddenly,  “Oh crap, I forgot to have kids!”    It was literally like that.  I was opening Christmas cards from friend and suddenly their babies were  teenagers.

The good news? I was married and had been for 15 years to a man who is a saint, and fortunately, we  keep the house stocked with wine, so we quickly remedied the situation.  I now have two toddlers.

But I am 40 years old and have two toddlers! I am exhausted.

So, can you have it all?   Yes, yes you can.   But can you have it all at once?   Not so much.

Sometimes it will be all about your career,  other times more about your family or your kids.   Expect it to shift, expect  it to change.   And  that is okay.   That is life.

Your life will  have chapters, complete with crazy characters, villains and a  plot you can’t even imagine as you sit here today.

It’s a lot like a Scooby Doo episode.

You’re gonna see things you can’t believe.  Surround yourself with good friends.    Keep your eyes on the road ahead.   The  haunted mansion is a not a great short cut.  Ask questions.  Be scrappy.  Break up the plots of villains.  And  don’t worry about Scooby Snacks, you’re an Ole Miss grad, grab a bourbon and enjoy the ride.

Thank you all,  kiss your parents, hug your mothers,  good luck  and congratulations.

Good morning, good morning. I am Stephen Colbert and I want to thank the class of 2013 for inviting me here today. Thank you very much, it’s an honor.

This is way more than I expected. This is incredibly generous, I would have done it for free; it’s incredibly generous. Thank you.

Now before we get started, I just want a little bit of business, ah, out of courtesy, If anyone here has a cell phone, please take a moment to make sure it's turned on. I wouldn't want anyone to miss a text or a tweet while I'm giving my speech. In fact, you might want to take a moment right now, and follow my Twitter feed, it’s @stephenathome, just in case I tweet anything during the speech.

And now, then, it is an honor to speak at your 2013 Valedictory Exercises - I believe that means I am this year's valedictorian, and I am as shocked as you are, because I didn't make it to many classes this year. You guys must've really tanked your finals, thank you for that.

I'd also like to thank President Teresa Sullivan. Thank you very much, President Sullivan, you are way better than that last president, Teresa Sullivan, she was terrible. I am so glad they cut her loose. Good riddance, I say! No, you are clearly the woman for this job.

I would also like to thank the Board of Visitors; Board of Visitors, of course, that name goes all the way back to your founder Thomas Jefferson, who was just trying to put the local Indians at ease - "Just visiting, must be going home any century now."

And just as many of the unique, dignified things that set UVA apart from other universities. Instead of “freshmen” you have “first years,” instead of a "quad" you call it a "lawn," instead of saying, "We are members of a proud educational tradition dating back to our nation’s founders," you say "Wahoowa," which begs the eternal question, "Wahoo-why?"

Now, I went to Hampden-Sydney College, {applause} thank you, thank you, please sit down, and I used to come up here as much as I could, because, you had these things back then, I’m not sure what you call them now - "girls." We did not have those at Hampden-Sydney, and when I could not find one of those here, I would head over to the “White Spot” to get a Grillswith to fill the void in my heart. Literally, my cardiologist has found recently one lodged in there. And, early this morning, I had a little tour around your beautiful campus and I just asked myself, "Why are you leaving?"

You know what it’s like out there, right? Plus this could be the most spectacular place you will ever live. It is the only campus in America designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. I believe it means that if you try to carve your name into a desk, UN will send in ground troops, and you are not gonna’ top these living conditions unless your post college plans are to sublet the Taj Mahal.

I just want to say the UVA students are incredible. The men are all gentlemen. And the women are all the most beautiful and intelligent in the world. I'm not just saying that because I dated a UVA girl. I'm saying it because I married her.

You are graduates of one of the most highly ranked universities in the nation. US News & World Report ranks you as the number two public university. Princeton Review named you number one in best value of a public college. Especially for those of you who showed the initiative to be born in Virginia. Let’s give a round of applause to those of you who pay out of state tuition. Because without those people, tomorrow instead of wearing gowns and mortarboards, you'd be graduating in ponchos made of Hefty bags with used pizza boxes on your head.

As has been stated before, the most impressive ranking of all has once again has to be Playboy once again naming you the number one party school in America. Now to be clear, I only read Playboy for the rankings. But I am not surprised by this honor – I have seen you in action. When I used to visit back in the days, I spent a fair amount of time at the Phi-Kap House, which at that time had no doors, because apparently, they kept being partied off their hinges. But I’m not going on more about those days because I cannot remember them.

And you know this is an impressive institution because it rejected my application. Yes, in the spring of 1984 I applied as a transfer student, and at the time you could send your essay after the rest of your application. Apparently the admission board took issue with the content of my essay, which was none, because I never sent it. So today, President Sullivan, I would like to submit this address as my essay. Since this is a smart school, let me just toss in some SAT words: syzygy, heterodox, Benedict Cumberbatch. Am I in? I know, I am not a Virginia resident.

But perhaps the real reason UVA is so great is that it trusts its students. You have the nation’s oldest student-run honor code. Say it with me - on my honor, I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this assignment, so help me Adderall.

My favorite thing about UVA has got to be your secret societies. That's sexy. You got the Z’s, you got I think the Illuminati, the Masons, and Shield, I think some of you remember the Shield. But of course the most secret of all is the Sevens Society. Nobody knows who's in it. I'm not going to say I'm a Seven. I'm not going to say I'm not a Seven ... I'm just going to say eviganblumencroft ... benedictcomberbachen Now I have to have all of you killed!

Now, of course, many of you already know, but for the uninitiated let me explain: When a member of the Seven dies, a wreath of black magnolias shaped like seven appears at their grave, and the university chapel chimes at seven seconds interval, on the seventh dissonant chord of the seventh minute past the hour. All the group’s donations contain the number seven like it’s $777,777 grant to fund the Meed endowment, so it appears that the way you qualify for the Sevens is by having a crippling OCD, and you know what is good for that – Adderall!!

Now, what is not a secret is the list of the distinguished UVA alums, which is as impressive as it was easy to copy and paste from Wikipedia. You got Woodrow Wilson, Robert Kennedy, Janet Napolitano, Katie Couric, Tina Fay, the painter Georgia O’Keefe – I love her paintings – they remind me of something I never saw at Hampden-Sydney. And, of course, Edgar Allan Poe, or as his roommates called him, Creepy Eddie. I don’t understand why Lenore couldn’t have just given him a pity date, or just that “I am busy Saturday night”; she didn’t have to say “nevermore”. Like most students, young Mr. Poe had a way of signaling tom his roommates if he had a date over. He would hang a sock on the door, or bury a still-beating heart under the floorboards, whichever he had handy.

But of course the greatest figure associated with UVA is your founder, Thomas Jefferson - TJ, Prez Tommy Jeff, the freckly anti-federalist, Louisiana purchee, old Bible Slicer, or as most Americans know him, the inventor of the six-inch wooden cypher wheel. In founding this great institution, Jefferson wrote – “We wish to establish in the upper country of Virginia a university on a plan so broad and liberal and modern, to be a temptation of youth to other states to come and drink the cup of knowledge and fraternize with us,” and according to Playboy you lived up to that vision.

But there’s one thing about Jefferson that I take issue is this: the scope of his beliefs, which were too broad. Jefferson is hard to nail down. These days we would like politicians to fit into a category – you are either conservative or liberal. But not Jefferson; he is not like that. No matter what are your political leanings, you can find something he said to back that up. If you don’t trust the financial industry, he said “I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberty than standing army.” If you are suspicious of federal overreach,” he said, “When a government fears the people there is a liberty, and when people fear the government there is tyranny. If you question religion”, he wrote, “In every country and in every age the priests have been hostile to liberty, and if you are an advocate of fiscal austerity” he said, “I’m gonna pop some tags, only got $20 in my pocket, I’m, I’m, I’m hunting, looking for a come up, this is (fucking) awesome” - I’m not saying that on camera. That, of course, was in a letter to the Secretary of State Ryan Lewis.

Also on the one hand, in Jefferson's public life as a founding father, we often see him as the embodiment of the white male patriarchy. But in his private life, he was known for, shall we say, embracing diversity. Very affirmative in his actions, am I right? I'm right; they did the DNA tests on that one.

You know what? I'm not going to say any more on that, you've heard too much about that in the past, instead I'll just tweet it.

Now, while that’s arriving all over your phones right now, I am going to take the opportunity to move to the advice section of the speech.

If you young folks will take advice from anyone, after all, I don’t know if you've seen it — this week’s Time Magazine called you “lazy, entitled narcissists,” who are part of the “Me, Me, Me” generation. So self-obsessed - tweeting your Vines, hashtagging your Spotifys and Snapchatting your YOLOs - your generation needs everything to be about you. And that's very upsetting to us baby boomers because self-absorption is kind of our thing. We're the original "Me Generation," we made the last 50 years all about us. We took all the money. We soaked up all the government services. And we've deep-fried nearly everything in the ocean. It may seem that all that’s left for you is unpaid internships, Monday to Tuesday mail delivery, and thanks to global warming, soon Semester at Sea will mean sailing the coast of Ohio.

Now, in our defense, in my generation’s defense – how were we supposed to know that you were coming? We thought it went like this: every successive generation of mankind – and then us! Ta-dah – roll credits.

But while we may be leaving you with an economy with fewer job opportunities for the new graduate to slip into and while traditional paths may seem harder to find, that also means that you will learn sooner than most generations the hard lesson that you must always make the path for yourself. There is no secret society out there that will tap you on the shoulder one night and show you the way. Because the true secret is - your life will not be defined by the society that we have left you.

To paraphrase Robert Bolt, "Society has no more idea of what you are than you do, because ultimately it has only your brains to think with. Every generation must define itself and so make a world that suits itself ..." So if you must find your own path, and you are left with no easy path, then decide to take the hard path that leads you to the life and the world that you want.

And don’t worry if we do not approve of your choices. In our benign self-absorption, I believe we have given you a gift; a particular form of independence, for you do not owe the previous generation anything. Thanks to us, you owe it to the Chinese.

So have the courage to follow the example of your founder, Thomas Jefferson, the greatest mind of that most daring generation, to create something new for yourselves, "and lay its foundation on such principals and organizing its power in such form as to you shall seem most likely to affect your safety and happiness." And know that though he wrote these words 237 years ago, that this generation, no less than his generation, has their own opportunity to recognize and seize that moment “when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bands that have connected them with another and assume among the powers of the earth your separate and equal station and for the support of this, mutually pledge to each other your lives, your fortune and your sacred honor.” If anyone can do this, it is the graduates of the university that Jefferson founded. You are his intellectual heirs. In fact, some of you may be his actual heirs; we’re still testing the DNA.

So thank you for this honor and congratulations to the class of 2013. Wahoowa.

Educators have long known that certain skills are critical to learning and development. These skills include mental concentration, critical thinking, problem solving, coping, competitiveness, self-confidence, self-esteem, among others. Throughout human history, acquiring these skills has traditionally been facilitated by experiences in nature. For children, this typically occurred in settings near the home, while for adolescents and adults often in wilder areas where they might experience challenge, the need to adapt and cope and, not unusually, deal with adversity and adventure.

Even in modern times, studies of persons who participate in outdoors programs has revealed a similar effect. These outdoor programs typically involve leaving the comforts of home to spend extended periods of time in relatively primitive settings in the company of others. The challenges confronted are reflected in the remarks of this young woman:

“I was unsure how to contribute, not being particularly strong or experienced in the outdoors. In the past two weeks, I’ve faced the physical challenge in unexpectedly cold conditions. I’ve faced emotional challenges of overcoming my pride at being presumably not especially physically able, and of having my most deeply held beliefs about human interactions and our modern world challenged at almost every turn along the way.”

This woman left her safe, secure, and protected life to be physically and mentally challenged in a wilderness setting. She hiked long distances, climbed steep terrain, camped and cooked under primitive conditions, and confronted diverse hazards. She experienced aches, pains, soreness, discomfort, and the necessity of coping with various adversities. Yet, like most participants, she also experienced extraordinary rewards, including greater physical fitness, an enhanced ability to solve problems, an improved capacity for cooperating with others, and a growing sense of self-confidence and self-esteem. At the end of her trip, she remarked:

“My experience occurred at a pivotal point in my life. It gave me the opportunity to take a risk. It strengthened my sense of self. It gave me a feeling of purposefulness, self-respect, and strength that I had never had before…[It] was the most amazing, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking, and challenging experience of my life. It helped me to believe that if there is anything I really want to do in life, I have the ability to do it…It helped me to realize who I was and how I fit into the world around me. Being in nature gave me an unbelievable confidence in myself. I found a beauty, strength, and an inner peace that I never knew was present…These are skills I consider to be important to everything that I do, and I feel they will help me continue to be successful throughout my life…When I now face a more “complex” problem in the  world, I need only to go back to see what solution I came to when it was just me against myself surrounded by simplicity and the answer becomes clear.”

Yet, our modern society is not one of primitive natural settings, but a world where we spend on average 90% of our time in an indoor built environment often in a city. Does the experience of nature bear any relevance to this increasingly urban existence? Does it relate to how you as graduates will deal with a largely constructed and fabricated society? I believe it does and let me illustrate this with another anecdote, this time involving a recently completed educational facility and an event that occurred there. 

The event was a symposium honoring the pioneering ecologist Aldo Leopold, and it occurred on the top floor of a recently constructed sustainably designed building. I had been involved in the planning and design of the facility, where both “low environmental impact” and what we called “biophilic design” objectives were of critical importance. Low environmental impact design stresses reducing pollution and waste, striving for energy efficiency and resource recycling, and other strategies aimed at minimizing environmental damage. Biophilic design objectives emphasize enhancing human physical and mental health and wellbeing through fostering connections between people and nature in the modern built environment.

Our building achieved its low-impact environmental objectives, reflected in it receiving the highest U.S. Green Building Council’s Platinum rating. The building also accomplished its biophilic design goals through such features as extensive natural lighting, natural ventilation, views to the outdoors, restored landscapes, inside-outside connections, courtyards, colonnades, naturalistic landscaping, water features, natural materials, and interior designs that mimicked shapes and forms found in nature.

The symposium honoring Leopold occurred in a large meeting room on the building’s top floor that had a great vaulted ceiling, arched spaces, extensive natural lighting and materials, floors and walls clad in local harvested wood, the fractal geometry of complementary yet varying patterns reminiscent of nature, views to the surrounding trees and courtyards, and the information richness and organized complexity of the natural world. It was a contemporary construction in an environmentally transformed city, among the most advanced forms of modern technology and, as a building, of course, an inanimate object. Yet, most people described this building as feeling “alive, natural, and not artificial.”

I asked the symposium participants how they felt about the building and this particular space. Did they personally like being there? Did they feel alert and productive in this setting? Did they think Aldo Leopold would have enjoyed working there? All the attendees enthusiastically expressed their affection for the building, how well they worked in it, and the belief that Leopold would have felt the same way. I asked them to imagine a time ten years from now when the energy-efficient solar rooftop collectors and other low-environmental-impact technology had largely become obsolete. At this time, I asked, would the building’s occupants be motivated to renovate and restore this facility? The participants unanimously expressed the view that the building’s occupants would seek to preserve this facility because of their strong affection, attachment, and allegiance to it.

Without realizing it, the participants had acknowledged the importance of connections to nature as a fundamental basis for personal satisfaction, productivity, and an underlying motivation for conservation. Our focus that day was a lifeless human-made construction. Yet the symposium participants agreed their ability to work well in that building and people’s affection for it decades from now would depend not on its technical achievements but on their having come to cherish, emotionally identify with, and even love this structure, whose destruction would be viewed as abhorrent and unacceptable.

What do these two anecdotes of a young woman involved in an outdoors program and the design of a new educational building mean to you as persons about to graduate from a professional educational and engineering school?  I believe they are pieces of the same puzzle that inform us that everything we do and experience – including our personal growth, productivity, and chances for success and fulfillment continue to rely to varying degrees and in different ways on nature as guide and model for how to live our lives, even in our increasingly built, urban and modern world. 

I have devoted much of my career to examining the relation of people and nature. My most important finding has been that humanity remains the product of its evolved relationship with the natural world. Our senses, our emotions, even our intellect developed in close association with nature, and even in our modern society, our physical and mental health continues to be dependent on a vast web of interconnections with the natural world.

This contention defies what many have come to believe is the hallmark of human progress and civilization: the conquest of nature and our seeming triumph over our biology as just another animal species. Many today regard humanity as having overcome its reliance on nature through the wonders of education, science and technology. We marvel at our ability to communicate in seconds, gather vast amounts of information, defeat diseases that once ravaged millions, and obtain goods and services that the most privileged of a few centuries ago could not have imagined. We wonder do we still need nature for anything more than raw materials transformed into higher and better uses, or an occasional outdoor experience, nice but not necessary?

Contemporary society is justifiably proud of its standard of living, physical health, and the material comforts it has achieved. Still, for humanity to be successful and sustainable, not just materially but also mentally and spiritually, these achievements must continuye to rest on a bedrock of nurturing relation to the natural world. This dependence is not just a matter of raw materials, clean water, and productive soils. More fundamentally, it bears on our capacities to feel, think, communicate, create, solve problems, form a secure and meaningful identity, and even find meaning and purpose in our lives. Whether we choose to be farmers or financiers, engineers or educators, labor with our bodies or toil with our minds, our safety and security still relies on the quality of our connections to the natural world.

Yet, contact with nature is not some magical elixir that will readily bestow success and fulfillment. Life is a struggle with uncertain outcomes. Nonetheless, the natural world remains the substrate on which we must build our existence. Lacking a benign and nurturing relation to nature, our wellbeing inevitably suffers. In a society estranged from the natural world, our very sanity would become imperiled, no matter the material comforts and conveniences we might enjoy. By contrast, a life of affirmative relation to nature carries with it the potential for a rich and rewarding existence.  

I do not wish to belittle the accomplishments of modern life. Returning to some idyllic existence far removed from modern technology and the contemporary city is not likely possible or desirable. Still, our fitness and fulfillment as individuals and as a society will remain dependent on our ongoing connections to the world beyond ourselves. If we deny or subvert our inherent need to affiliate with nature, we invite our decline as surely as the more obvious threats of war and disease.

Humanity stands at a crossroads today, having greatly undervalued the natural world beyond its narrow material utility. We have deluded ourselves into assuming human progress and civilization depends on dominating and transcending nature. What we require now is a renewed realization of how much our physical, mental and even spiritual wellbeing continues to rely on our relationship to natural systems and processes. Our society will become increasingly fabricated and artificial, but to be successful and sustainable, we must remain true to our biology rooted in nature. If we stray too far from our inherited dependence on the natural world, we do so at our peril.

Nature can instead be our healer and restorer in times of stress and disorder, and when healthy and creative our source of inspiration and guidance. As the great scientist and writer, Rachel Carson, concluded: 

“Is the exploration of the natural world just a pleasant way to pass the golden hours…or is there something deeper? I am sure there is something deeper, something lasting and significant… Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts. There is symbolic as well as actual beauty in the migration of the birds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the folded bud ready for the spring. There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature.”

Nine Life Lessons

1. You Don’t Have To Have A Dream. 
Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams. Fine, if you have something that you’ve always dreamed of, like, in your heart, go for it! After all, it’s something to do with your time… chasing a dream. And if it’s a big enough one, it’ll take you most of your life to achieve, so by the time you get to it and are staring into the abyss of the meaninglessness of your achievement, you’ll be almost dead so it won’t matter.

I never really had one of these big dreams. And so I advocate passionate dedication to the pursuit of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on whatever is in front of you… you never know where you might end up. Just be aware that the next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery. Which is why you should be careful of long-term dreams. If you focus too far in front of you, you won’t see the shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right? Good. Advice. Metaphor. Look at me go.

2. Don’t Seek Happiness
Happiness is like an orgasm: if you think about it too much, it goes away. Keep busy and aim to make someone else happy, and you might find you get some as a side effect. We didn’t evolve to be constantly content. Contented Australophithecus Afarensis got eaten before passing on their genes.

3. Remember, It’s All Luck 
You are lucky to be here. You were incalculably lucky to be born, and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family that helped you get educated and encouraged you to go to Uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family, that’s unlucky and you have my sympathy… but you were still lucky: lucky that you happened to be made of the sort of DNA that made the sort of brain which – when placed in a horrible childhood environment – would make decisions that meant you ended up, eventually, graduating Uni. Well done you, for dragging yourself up by the shoelaces, but you were lucky. You didn’t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They’re not even your shoelaces.

I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever dubious achievements I’ve achieved … but I didn’t make the bit of me that works hard, any more than I made the bit of me that ate too many burgers instead of going to lectures while I was here at UWA.

Understanding that you can’t truly take credit for your successes, nor truly blame others for their failures will humble you and make you more compassionate.

Empathy is intuitive, but is also something you can work on, intellectually.

4. Exercise
I’m sorry, you pasty, pale, smoking philosophy grads, arching your eyebrows into a Cartesian curve as you watch the Human Movement mob winding their way through the miniature traffic cones of their existence: you are wrong and they are right. Well, you’re half right – you think, therefore you are… but also: you jog, therefore you sleep well, therefore you’re not overwhelmed by existential angst. You can’t be Kant, and you don’t want to be.

Play a sport, do yoga, pump iron, run… whatever… but take care of your body. You’re going to need it. Most of you mob are going to live to nearly a hundred, and even the poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth that most humans throughout history could not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious life ahead of you is going to make you depressed!

But don’t despair! There is an inverse correlation between depression and exercise. Do it. Run, my beautiful intellectuals, run. And don’t smoke. Natch.

5. Be Hard On Your Opinions 
A famous bon mot asserts that opinions are like arse-holes, in that everyone has one. There is great wisdom in this… but I would add that opinions differ significantly from arse-holes, in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined.

We must think critically, and not just about the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs. Take them out onto the verandah and beat them with a cricket bat.
Be intellectually rigorous. Identify your biases, your prejudices, your privilege.

Most of society’s arguments are kept alive by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend to generate false dichotomies, then try to argue one point using two entirely different sets of assumptions, like two tennis players trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate tennis courts.

By the way, while I have science and arts grads in front of me: please don’t make the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are at odds with one another. That is a recent, stupid, and damaging idea. You don’t have to be unscientific to make beautiful art, to write beautiful things.

If you need proof: Twain, Adams, Vonnegut, McEwen, Sagan, Shakespeare, Dickens. For a start.

You don’t need to be superstitious to be a poet. You don’t need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You don’t have to claim a soul to promote compassion.

Science is not a body of knowledge nor a system of belief; it is just a term which describes humankind’s incremental acquisition of understanding through observation. Science is awesome.

The arts and sciences need to work together to improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians – including our new PM and my distant cousin Nick – believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming is controversial, is a powerful indicator of the extent of our failure to communicate. The fact that 30% of this room just bristled is further evidence still. The fact that that bristling is more to do with politics than science is even more despairing.

6. Be a teacher
Please? Please be a teacher. Teachers are the most admirable and important people in the world. You don’t have to do it forever, but if you’re in doubt about what to do, be an amazing teacher. Just for your twenties. Be a primary school teacher. Especially if you’re a bloke – we need male primary school teachers. Even if you’re not a Teacher, be a teacher. Share your ideas. Don’t take for granted your education. Rejoice in what you learn, and spray it.

7. Define Yourself By What You Love
I’ve found myself doing this thing a bit recently, where, if someone asks me what sort of music I like, I say “well I don’t listen to the radio because pop lyrics annoy me”. Or if someone asks me what food I like, I say “I think truffle oil is overused and slightly obnoxious”. And I see it all the time online, people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists or the Liberal Party. We have tendency to define ourselves in opposition to stuff; as a comedian, I make a living out of it. But try to also express your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank-you cards and give standing ovations. Be pro-stuff, not just anti-stuff.

8. Respect People With Less Power Than You 
I have, in the past, made important decisions about people I work with – agents and producers – based largely on how they treat wait staff in restaurants. I don’t care if you’re the most powerful cat in the room, I will judge you on how you treat the least powerful. So there.

9. Don’t Rush.
You don’t need to already know what you’re going to do with the rest of your life. I’m not saying sit around smoking cones all day, but also, don’t panic. Most people I know who were sure of their career path at 20 are having midlife crises now.

I said at the beginning of this ramble that life is meaningless. It was not a flippant assertion. I think it’s absurd: the idea of seeking “meaning” in the set of circumstances that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans to think the universe has a purpose for them. However, I am no nihilist. I am not even a cynic. I am, actually, rather romantic. And here’s my idea of romance:

You will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and, god, it’s tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad. And then you’ll be
old. And then you’ll be dead.

There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence, and that is: fill it. Not fillet. Fill. It.

And in my opinion (until I change it), life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can, taking pride in whatever you’re doing, having compassion, sharing ideas, running(!), being enthusiastic. And then there’s love, and travel, and wine, and sex, and art, and kids, and giving, and mountain climbing … but you know all that stuff already.

It’s an incredibly exciting thing, this one, meaningless life of yours. Good luck.

Greetings, President Krislov, graduating students, families, friends, faculty, trustees, alumni, and honored guests.

Graduating Class of 2013, I want you to think back for a moment to four years ago, to September 2009 when most of you first arrived on campus. Remember walking in to your dorm room at Dascomb or Burton or South and meeting your roommate for the first time? Remember your first dinner in one of the cafeterias? Remember trying to find where your classes were and sitting down in the first class? Think of all you’ve gone through over these last four years: the lectures, the papers, the nights studying at Mudd Library, the finals, the convocations, the junior recitals, the senior recitals, the co-op dinners, the Drag Balls, the Safer Sex Nights, the frenetic dancing at the ’Sco. Think of how far you’ve come, and give yourselves a massive round of applause. Congratulations!

It’s a huge honor to be standing on this stage before you. In May 1984, I was sitting where you are now, not in a million years thinking that 29 years later I would be up here. I know what you’re thinking about now as you sit there, and it’s certainly not my speech. I don’t remember a thing the Commencement speaker said at my graduation. Instead I was thinking about all the goodbyes I was going to have to say, about the logistics of leaving a place I loved, about launching myself into the unknown.

I was also thinking about some of the missed opportunities and how now I would never get the chance to paint a rock in Tappan Square, or look through the telescope at Peters observatory, or take an art history class. I felt terrified, and also a little empty.

I’m going to describe what will happen to most of you at the end of this ceremony. Everyone will be milling around, and you’ll start grabbing people and saying goodbye to them. You’ll give someone a big long hug, maybe you’ll cry a little, you’ll say goodbye, you’ll turn away. Then five minutes later you’ll run into them again, and you’ll avoid eye contact because that goodbye is done, you’ve ticked it off the list, and you don’t want to have to go through it again. Yeah, it’s really awkward. Have fun with that.

At the end of my Commencement, after I’d done all the goodbyes and awkward eye contact avoidance, I walked back to the house I’d been sharing with four other seniors on South Park Street. It’s the one you can see all the way along East Vine Street, right at the end, next to the Seventh Day Adventist Church. So I walked along East Vine Street to the house, and my parents and some of my housemates’ parents were there, because we were going to have a little celebration, some cake and champagne, before we all went off. I got there, and my housemates got there, and it turned out all five of us had walked home alone. One of the parents said it was the most pathetic thing she’d ever seen, us each walking down East Vine alone.

Because we felt very alone. We were all graduating together, sure, hundreds of us, as you all are together today. And yet, each of us had to make our way alone into our own future.

I know I can’t really say anything that will soften the shock for you of leaving Oberlin. You are going to have to experience your own solitary walk along East Vine Street. Like birth and death, you know everyone will experience it, and that’s a comfort of sorts; but still, when you do it, you have to do it alone.

Today is one of those liminal moments in your life, a threshold moment, where you’re passing between two states of being. You’re going from being an Oberlin student to being a person at large in the world. These liminal moments can bring out strange emotions. You might laugh hysterically. You might cry a lot. You might be numb. When my friend Amy and I left for D.C. the day after graduation, we drove for two hours without saying a word. I think we were in shock.

I see my job here today as being your companion for the first block of that walk along East Vine that you’re going to have to make. You might not want to talk, and that’s fine, because I’m going to do the talking. I’m going to give you some advice.

See, if you put an older person up in front of a bunch of 21 year olds, the temptation to dish out advice is almost overwhelming, and I’m going to succumb to it. I can’t help it. Those of you out there with younger brothers and sisters, you know how you can’t help giving them advice? Well, that’s how I feel.

I’m speaking to you today partly because I’m a writer, but also because I’m an Oberlin graduate too, of the Class of 1984. Oberlin is a remarkable place to get an education. It is now, it was when I went here, and it was even from its founding in 1833. Oberlin has always been synonymous with progressive thinking, with a concern for equality, and with a tolerance for difference.

That’s the principle, anyway. In reality, as you have witnessed yourselves this year, Oberlin is far from perfect. There is plenty of the “real world” here too: intolerance, prejudice, stupidity. But you know, it’s always been like that. When I was researching The Last Runaway, a novel I wrote about the Underground Railroad and set just outside of Oberlin in the 1850s, I discovered that, in among the abolitionists, there were also Oberlin residents who supported slavery and turned over runaways to bounty hunters.

Historical perspective can be a reminder that no place or person is perfect. It is part of our education here that we develop heightened awareness and resilience in the face of mischievous bigotry. Oberlin students did that in the 19th century, and we do it now. Take comfort in the long view, in being part of a much bigger picture.
I’m also speaking to you as a writer. I didn’t really set out to be a writer. I talked about it as a kid, because I loved books so much, but I also talked about becoming a librarian or a teacher – both sources of books to me as a child. At Oberlin I was an English major, but I didn’t take any creative writing classes. However, I did read a lot, which is a crucial part of a writer’s training.

Also, I didn’t know it at the time, but I was collecting interests that I’ve ended up turning into novels. If you had looked in my dorm room at Dascomb my freshman year, you would have seen posters of unicorns on the walls, because I had a thing about unicorns. Later I ended up writing the novel The Lady and the Unicorn about medieval tapestries of the same name. Sophomore year, in a different room in Dascomb, I hung up a different poster, of a painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer called Girl with a Pearl Earring. My novel with that title was my fictional account of the unknown model’s life. And you know that street, East Vine, the one I walked along after graduation? I set a scene there in The Last Runaway.

The interests I had at Oberlin all got thrown into the pot of my mind and stewed away there, to emerge 20-something years later into books. Don’t underestimate your time here. The experiences you’ve had and the interests you’ve developed may well turn up years later in the oddest ways.

Since I’m a writer, I’m going to give you advice in the form of five mantras about writing that I repeat to myself, and that you can apply to the novel that is your life.

1. Don’t write about what you know; write about what you’re interested in.
Lots of people, when they first start writing, write about themselves. But I’m going to be blunt: You’re not as interesting as you think you are. And even if you’ve had an unusual life, a difficult life, a shocking life, it’s not easy to write about it well. We seem to have little perspective on ourselves and what will be appealing to others.

That’s partly why I moved into writing historical novels – it takes me away from my self, so that you don’t have to read about me. Writing about places and times I know nothing about has gotten me interested in all kinds of strange things. In the name of research I’ve gone fossil hunting, given tours in a Victorian cemetery, learned to quilt. I’ve handled priceless medieval tapestries and held the original notebook William Blake drafted Songs of Innocence and of Experience in.

When I graduated from Oberlin I had no idea that I was going to do any of those things. I don’t know where my next books will take me and what they will teach me, and that makes the world wide open. I love that.

Don’t write what you already know, write what you want to know. How does this apply to life? It means not being complacent. It means trying out new things, being open to the world in its many varied forms. It can be little things like eating a different kind of food, or big things like visiting countries you know nothing about. Be unpredictable, and never stop learning.

2. Plan, but be spontaneous too.
People often ask me if I know how a novel is going to end when I start writing it, and how much it’s all planned out. And you know, sometimes I know the ending, but a lot of times I don’t. To me a novel is a journey, for the writer, the main character, and the reader. When I’m writing it I usually have a sense of the shape of the emotional journey, even if I’m not sure about every route I’m going to take. Things change as I’m writing, but usually the integrity of the journey remains. When I sit down to write a scene, I may know where I’m aiming to get to, but I also try out things spontaneously. It makes what I write lighter and less self-conscious.

Same with life. When I was at Oberlin I thought I might end up in publishing in New York. Instead I’m a novelist in London. Was this part of some great plan, all worked out my senior year – a carefully sculpted path towards a career? Hell no.

A lot of my life has felt accidental. I moved to London for six months and ended up there permanently. I got my first publishing job not because I had a great résumé, but because I gate crashed a party and happened to talk to the right person. I did an MA in creative writing in part because I got mad at my boss one day and decided I had to get away from my job. Maybe things are different now, but back in the day, we kind of messed around a bit before discovering a career.

Those first years out of Oberlin, I didn’t expect to have a great job. I just wanted to pay the rent. It was enough simply to be out in the world, to find a place to live and some kind of job. I didn’t need to do something more meaningful yet. Just living was meaningful enough.

Sorry, parents out there, I know this is not what you want to hear. You want your kids to have a plan, so that they don’t sofa surf at home for the next five years. I’m a parent too, and I want my son to have a plan. But life is not like that. Think back over your own life’s path and how haphazard it was. It’s good to have a point on the horizon you’re aiming for, yes – but look around too. Be distracted. After all, distractions can sometimes turn into careers. Plan, but be spontaneous too.

3. Less is more.
This is a phrase coined by the architect Mies van der Rohe, with the idea that simplicity in buildings – and in all things - is more effective.

I learned this lesson when I was writing Girl with a Pearl Earring. It seemed clear to me that in a novel about a Vermeer painting, I should imitate with words what he did with paint. Most of his paintings take place in the same corner of the same room, and depict women going about their daily business, often alone, focused on pouring milk, reading a letter, trying on a necklace. X-rays have shown how Vermeer originally painted more things in the background, like maps, bowls, chairs, and then took them out. Because there is less in the paintings, it makes what’s there more significant and easier to concentrate on.

Less is more is a lesson that can be applied to most things. In writing, when you start cluttering your sentences with too many words and clauses, and your characters with too many issues, and your structure with too much trickery, you lose clarity. In fashion terms, one well-chosen necklace has much more impact than decking yourself out with multiple earrings, bangles, rings.

In life, when you’re 21 years old and staring into the great unknown? Travel light. Try not to worry about things too much. I’ve noticed among my friends, who are mostly my age, that we all feel weighed down with stuff. Our homes are too cluttered.

It’s hard not to become obsessed with stuff. We live in a consumerist society where everyone is encouraged to buy things, to want the newest gadget, to care about the make of car or the brand of shoes. It gets exhausting. Don’t you get tired of it? All those ads, on TV, on Facebook, on the subway, telling us to buy, buy, buy. Give me a freaking break. Travel light, it will keep you light. Less is more.

Related to less is more, my fourth bit of writing advice is this:

4. Use adjectives and adverbs as little as possible.
Stephen King said about adverbs: “Spend them sparingly, like they were $100 bills.” He is absolutely right. No, I correct that: He is right. Yeah, you see what I did there. I removed “absolutely” – because you don’t need the adverb. The adverb dilutes the sentence by trying too hard.

Nouns and verbs are the backbone of speech. They do the heavy lifting. Most of the time they do fine on their own and don’t need support from adjectives and adverbs. An adjective or adverb has to earn its right to be in a sentence. So after I’ve written something, I go back through it and see how many words I can get rid of. Usually I cut adjectives and adverbs.

Life is about nouns and verbs. It’s about action, about people doing. When you cut out adjectives and adverbs, you cut out the things that qualify action, or interpret or analyze action. You reach the pure essence of experience.

But too often we spend our time on adjectives and adverbs: we’ve gotten very busy interpreting everything. Sometimes I go on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram and I’m astonished at how some people post so much about what they’ve done, and I wonder how they ever had the time to actually do the stuff they post about. We’ve become a society of commentators on our own lives. And that commentating is taking away from the real experience.

I once caught a friend tweeting from a theatre, during a performance of a play. In fact she was tweeting that she was bored and couldn’t get into the production. Well of course she couldn’t. She was too busy tweeting about it! Some of you may well be tweeting or texting right now, either about what I’m saying, or more likely, about something completely different.

Do me a favor: put down the device. Take a big breath. Look around at the trees. Just be here. Experience the moment without commenting on it. Cut the adjectives and adverbs from your life, and focus on the verbs. Any newspaper editor will tell you that a story stands or falls on how punchy its verbs are. Make your life one long string of punchy verbs.

5. Remember your reader.
The act of writing may be a private one, a way for the writer to work something out for herself, but it is almost always written with the idea of sharing it with others. I think of the novels I write as contracts between me and you. A book is only half finished when I hand it to you – it’s your act of reading and reimagining the story that completes the book. In order to write it that way, I need to always think of you when I am working. It’s you I’m doing all this work for. If I get something out of it, that’s a secondary benefit.

Life really is better when you care more about others than about yourself. This is maybe the hardest thing to learn, but it makes all the difference. There are a lot of egotists in the world, but you don’t have to add to that number. Look outwards, reach out. Take the spotlight off of yourself and you will be happier, and more passionate, and more productive, and more interesting. Remember your reader.

We’re almost there, almost at the point where I let you go along East Vine Street on your own. I want to finish with a gift from the Class of 1984, my class. A lot of us were here this weekend for our 30th cluster reunion, and I asked people for short pieces of advice to give you. Of course there was a big outpouring, because older people love to give advice, but also because they care about you. I’m going to read a quick list of what they said:

Breathe.
...
There, that’s enough advice to last you a lifetime.

It’s time now. You know what time: it’s time for you to do the rest of the walk along East Vine Street into your future. I’ve accompanied you for a block or two, and the Class of 1984 has roared in your ear for several yards, and now it’s time for you to go on yourself. I have faith in you to walk well. So does the Class of 1984. So do your families, and your teachers, and your friends.

Go on, now, get outta here – go walk the walk. Thank you.

President Sullivan, Provost Low, Chairperson Cioffi, Distinguished Honoraries, Faculty, Staff and Graduates of the Class of 2013:

Because of you we are assembled today. Because you survived freshman tap classes, because you were holed up in cubicles at Bailey Howe until your eyes shut you down, because you drank so much of Henderson's free coffee during finals week they started charging, because you perfected your personal posture for the naked bike ride, AND STILL completed what you came here to do.....we are all today assembled here, in recognition and support, to express respect and to celebrate with a communal demonstration of undying interest IN you and a showering of love UPON you.

And because there is such excitement and emotion coming at you from every direction, you could easily pass on from this moment without fully appreciating and feeling the weight of it. Sit in the majesty of this moment. Standing right here alongside you is the entire sweep of your and our collective knowledge. We have come from all over this planet to share this experience--because of you.

WE ARE PARENTS AND STEP PARENTS:

Because of you we learned to animate bedtime stories, and we learned a deeper emotion than we thought possible. We were entertained by your humor and your exploits. You took us on a journey of you and through you we learned to better understand ourselves. You taught us empathy, patience and forbearance and you teach us, to this moment, the meaning of love.

WE ARE TEACHERS:

Because of you, we too survived freshman tap classes, we stayed up preparing lesson plans, reading papers, and giving that extra umptyumph to maintain UVM's tradition of mentor-style education. Yes, you tested our nerves, but your debating and questioning kept our minds sharp and nimble. We followed your struggles and tribulations, pulled for you in your hours of deepest uncertainty, and now, we celebrate and salute your successful negotiation of this most difficult journey. 

WE ARE FRIENDS:
Because of you, we partied harder than we knew was possible, we jumped off of the cliffs at Red Rock, hung at Club Metronome and the Monkey House, and sat in Brennan's eating free popcorn. We studied with an intensity that was only exceeded by the kinship we feel with one another. We have established bonds that will never be broken, relationships cemented by the pressure of trials, tribulations and various and sundry terrors that only visit college students.

WE ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS:

Because of you, we learned to share meals, space, the TV, and the attention of our parents. You supported us and set an example and you teased us and aggravated us and broke our toys and did dumb things, but here we are. If you don’t mess with us at the obligatory meal, I guess you are ok.

WE ARE GRANDPARENTS:

Because of you, we see our living legacy, you have animated our homes. In some instances, our home is also yours. We have shown you things we were too busy to do with your parents, we were able to give freely without the responsibility of disciplining, and we were also, happily able to send you home when you got to be too much.

Today, the sweeping traditions of family and university sit together in one long present moment. All the living generations intertwine -- the known and yet to be known locked in an unending dance of past and future. 

A favorite tradition in New Orleans is the jazz parade. The dancers that follow the band are called second liners. Our most celebrated song, When the Saints Go Marching In, has a line, 'Lord I want to be in that number, when the saints go marching in'. Well, we are in that number today. We are YOUR second line-- your support system. Our presence today IS our pride. And though there is much of life that you must face alone, you cannot make it out here in this world by yourself.

Your diploma is a hard earned symbol of achievement but the broadest education has already come from your life itself, and that life is all around you today. Embrace and cherish it. The widow of a successful New Orleans doctor once told me that she and her husband were at a luncheon banquet full of prominent doctors. During the meal, he started to have trouble swallowing something, and being embarrassed, he went to the bathroom, passed out, and died alone with a roomful of the best support available just a few feet away.

DON’T LEAVE YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM WHEN YOU ARE IN DISTRESS.

EMBRACE US. WE ARE HERE WHEN YOU NEED US. AND, IF NEEDS BE, WE WILL COME TO YOU.

Just as we have come today from everywhere, because of you. And as it is with all journeys, what was is not what will be. We all faced some degree of difficulty to get here today, adjustments had to be made, routines upset, and there will be more as this day wears on with the complexity of issues that are always on the menu when families assemble.

To journey is to embrace change. And though we sit in the shadow of the halls of erudition and scholarship, though you walk today on an established path in the echoing footsteps of ceremony, we know you are also building new paths that need to be built. And these new roads and bridges can only be constructed by you and you alone. Today affords you the perfect opportunity to re-meet family, friends and mentors as PEOPLE, not as 'MY mother or MY history teacher or MY college buddy'.

It’s harder to build than destroy. To build is to engage and change. In jazz, we call progressing harmonies changes. Changes are like obstacles on a speed course. They demand your attention and require you to be present. They are coming...they are here..... and then they are gone. It's how life comes. Each moment is a procession from the future into the past and the sweet spot is always the present.

Live in that sweet spot. Be present.

The great knight Sir Lancelot of the Round Table came upon an impassable bridge that was the blade of a sword stretched over a bottomless moat of rushing water. He was challenged to rescue Queen Guinevere on the other side. After surveying the situation and being told no knight had ever successfully kept his balance in crossing, he took off his armor and crossed on bloodied hand and knee. On returning with the queen, he was asked, “Why did you strip?” He replied, "I didn't want to worry about being cut." He understood: crossing this bridge is about being cut.

We all have such bridges to cross, and those too, are with us here today because all of the dynamics that shape our lives are here. And those dynamics are unruly and hard fought. Improvisation challenges the jazz man to give order to an unknowable present. The size and grandeur of this moment challenges you to be present and to create the relationships you want to experience.

This day is the final test of your college years. What you do is what you WILL do. I ask you to approach this day with grace, grit and gratitude. This is not preparation for life, THIS IS LIFE.

Your diploma is a symbol, it is a key. Have you ever looked all over the house for some keys that are in your hand? When it comes to your support system, don't be oblivious of the obvious. Mullah Nasruddin, a 13th century Sufi folk philosopher, would pass the same border crossing on his donkey 10 to 15 times a day. The border guards knew he was smuggling something and searched every possible hiding space for years. Never found anything. Some few years after they had retired and Nasrudin himself was no longer active, all of them accidentally happened to meet in a tea house. "Come on Mullah,” they chided, “we're all retired now. Nothing will be done to you. What were you smuggling all of those years?" The Mullah's reply, "Donkeys".

To my son, Simeon, who graduates today, and to all other graduates, I want to speak on behalf of Candace, Greg and all the parents and step parents who don't have the opportunity to personally comment publicly. From every changed diaper to every sickness to every shoulder ride and bedtime story, fights over curfew, over homework, over habits and even further onto all the triumphs and failures rolled up into one....we thank you.

You give meaning and depth to our lives and provide so many good times. We are proud of you--- and we fear for you because a part of us is not ready to accept that you are grown. But you are. Still, you will always be our baby, our child. We are parents and step parents, but we remain daughters and sons and grandsons and granddaughters, and so on as deep as genes can remember and as far as insight can stretch into the future.

We are teachers as well as sons and daughters and grandparents but we remain students even as we teach. We are brothers and sisters and will remain little or big sisters and brothers until we part from this earth. We are friends and many of us will remain so in memory or in deed until this natural life ends for each and every one of us.

And in this cycle we define each other’s lives across time and for all times, even as we define it in this very moment. We are proud of you and we are proud of ourselves in you. In this cycle of experiences, we find the real meaning of life. We ARE. And to BE, is to be present.

That's why we are all gathered here, in recognition and support, to express respect and to celebrate with a communal demonstration of undying interest IN you and a showering of love UPON you.

Because there is such excitement and emotion coming at you from every direction, you could easily pass on from this moment without fully appreciating and feeling the weight of it. We have come from all over this planet --because of you.

Congratulations. 

Hello. I am very fond of the waffles at Waffle House, but I am told epiphanies can also be had at Frank's, somehow in the form of a garbage plate. Is that right? I have been told. 

So greetings, greetings graduates, faculty, parents, administrators, distinguished alum, our trees, subscribers.

How many of you use Reddit? Just by a show of hands? Excellent. Up vote, up vote, up vote, up vote. Thank you. Up vote. I am so happy to see so many of you Redditers actually managed to graduate. That's great. I'm glad. You're not getting those hours back. Sorry, not sorry for the procrastination.

Yeah, but, you know what? Congratulations. Carthage class of 2014, feel good. Clap it up. You guys. This is it. This is it. All of those hours. Studying, all that time you spent studying. Every waking hour. Studying. I presume drinking coffee of course to supplement that studying, going back to the library to do more studying, lots of work but please do not be in a rush today, alright? Savor this. Savor this, enjoy this. Don't be in a rush to get out of here. I mean I hear actually only four of you have ever even completed the redman challenge. Four ever, come on. Come on. There's still time. And you've got time actually today. 

I know President Campbell who was just honored there, is gonna be around continuing to give advice about life, about careers and I have it on good authority also keg stands? Was that.. All, all valuable, all important. But a wise man, a wise man once said, I'm not here to talk about me, I'm here to inspire you by talking about me. That man was Steven Colbert. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do for the next hour and 12 minutes.

Not gonna do that. Some people, in fact I reckon a lot of you, ummm may have no idea who I am. 

Ummm hi my name's Alexis as you heard, I'm one of the founders of Reddit and I can say with total confidence that I would not be here where I am today had I not gone to college. You see I'm one of those tech founders that is not a college dropout. In fact... I was a history major. I know there's some history majors out there. Yes. Yes we can my fellow history majors. And just wait, just wait, that first post college trivia night you will shine.

Oh yeah, oh yeah. No it's, let me tell you I was able to start Reddit with my college roommate Steve Huffman and the story, how that all happened, was just kind of ridiculous. We started with a couple of laptops, in an apartment living room and today as you heard Reddit's one of the largest websites on the internet. It is crazy. And it all started with a check box. You see, once I got accepted I had a very simple option. It was either live in old dorms or new dorms. I didn't really know what the difference was. Old sounded kind of quaint and fun like I'd seen in movies with like these halls and people hanging out, playing video games, again, more studying and I thought this would be amazing, right I could live in old dorms great check, didn't think a single thing about it. 

Move in day happens and my parents are there, we're moving everything in, I find my dorm and across the hall I see this blonde-haired blue-eyed angel, Steve. And he... He's playing Gran Turismo on the Playstation 2 and I am thrilled because I didn't think there were gonna be any other gamers in college and I was so excited to meet him. He was disappointed, you see, he had seen my name on the door, Alexis and thought it was a coed hall. So, once we got passed that though, we became good friends, really good friends and it was amazing because that simple check box changed my life. 

Picking old dorms, this random subtle thing had a tremendous impact on my life and it happened just because of a gut instinct. There wasn't any real thought process to it, it was just instinct and what I mean to say by all this is look, life is going to be a series of these kinds of decisions, it's okay to not really know what you're doing and just trust your gut. Make the best judgement you can. There's not gonna be a syllabus assigned to you. It's gonna be using whatever knowledge you've gained, whatever resources you have to just figure it out, to just hack it. 

I mean, most of the time I still don't know what I'm doing. Okay, spoiler, really, like right now, preparing this speech, mostly gut, like no clue, but the reality is everyone is hacking it. Everyone is figuring out so if it feels like you don't really now what your plan is, you feel like it's changing every six months. That's okay. No one has it all figured out. I don't, I've not met a single person who does and I know that even when we were building Reddit, for us it was this little project, the two of thought maybe could one day be something special. 

You know Steve, he was the guy who actually built it, he wrote all of the code and so my job as the non technical founder was to just do everything else. So that meant ordering the Chinese food, that meant replacing the toner cartridges right, really cool CEO stuff. No, no it wasn't very glamorous. But that was okay. 

I'd been through enough jobs where I thought hey at least this is an opportunity for me to be working on something I love and I know how lucky I am for that. All of the experiences you've had, coming up to this point, they're all cumulative. 

One of the best jobs I got was actually my first and it was working at a little booth in a CompUSA, some of you may have no idea what a CompUSA is because that company is now defunct but people used to go into stores to buy computer-related products and there I would sit. I was about 13 going through puberty, with a headset and a microphone not unlike this, speaking to an entire CompUSA about a mouse or some learn-to-type software. It was the most boring awful thing imaginable and yet I had to go up and have the worst public speaking experience every 30 minutes cause that was my job. No one goes into a CompUSA to hear some 13 year old with a cracked voice talk about mice but I would do it and I knew it was bad because no one would be paying attention. Even people would come up to me and say kid no one's listening, just stop. And that was formative. That was helpful because every 30 minutes I would be going through the worst possible public speaking experience someone could imagine and it got me comfortable with it. 

All of the things you were doing, everything you will continue to do is a process, it is cumulative and it doesn't always look like the dots connect but they do. And look, as long as you find yourself challenged and happy and striving for those things that fulfill you, you are going to figure it out. And failure is gonna be part of the process, right, you're all here cause you're good at not failing, right? This is the culmination of doing a great job at not failing.

There are no GPAs after this. There's gonna be lots of set-backs, there's gonna be lots of failures. No one ever introduces me as the founder of my mobile menu. Also known as mmm. Because that was our first company. 

Before we started Reddit, Steve and I started that and for a year and a half worked on something that went nowhere. But that's okay. 

Failure is, it is an option. Even a few months into Reddit we were there in a little apartment in Medford Massachusetts and we got a call from an executive at a company called Yahoo. You guys know Yahoo right? Yes. They were offering to fly us out and have a meeting with us. One of these executives wanted us to come out to Silicon Valley. We made a mix cd, we were so excited. As a cultural reference, some of you will not understand but thank you for those who do. 

We were thrilled, it was our first trip to the valley and here we were our little start up and we were gonna present. We sat down in front of this executive at Yahoo and his team, we started talking about Reddit and a few minutes in he just cuts me off and he says how much traffic do you guys have anyway? How big is your site anyway? I said well, you know we just launched a few months ago. 10,000 users and he just laughs, he laughs at us, he's like you guys, you guys are a rounding error compared to Yahoo. What are you even doing here? I went, you invited us. Is that like a hazing ritual you do? You invite little start ups to your company and give them free Snickers bars and then make fun of them.

Needless to say, that meeting did not go well. We went back to Boston. Keep in mind, we were the generation, I have like seven participation trophies for basketball camp. And I still cannot dribble. So this hurt. And we went back home, it's true. And the next morning I printed something out and put it on my wall next to my desk and it was a few words. It was you are a rounding error. Cause I wanted to see every morning who we were proving wrong. This became my kind of wall of negative reinforcement. 

So my message to you is this listen, listen there are gonna be constructive critics in your life who are amazing. They're the ones who keep it real. They're the ones who help you get better and then there are gonna be haters. Haters gonna hate. Right? Scientifically proven, alright? What I got to say to you is ain't nobody got time for that, alright? No. It's true. It is not about giving up. It's not about listening to the haters. It is about finding ways to use that as motivation, as fuel to improve yourself and keep going for it because look, frankly, anytime you do or learn anything new you are going to probably fail. 

You're probably gonna suck at it. Let's be real. There's an amazing, magical dog that sums it up well. Sucking is the first step to being sort of good at something. It's Adventure Time, you can learn a lot from that show.

Everyone starts out bad at doing stuff. That is okay. There's no grade on this assignment. It's more like kind of pass fail alright? It's a process and that's what life is in simple terms. It is time spent alternating between successes and failures. 

You can't have one without the other. They're inextricably linked. And the sooner you become comfortable with this the better. Cause that's what life is, it's gonna be about curiosity and discovery and finding more and pushing yourself more and sometimes it will be about waffles, right, sometimes you'll find yourself in an LSAT prep class like I was, really hungry and you'll walk out because you wanna go to Waffle House. It was a Saturday morning. I didn't want that LSAT as badly as I wanted those waffles and I sat there thinking, if I don't really, if I want these waffles more than the LSAT, should I really be a lawyer? Law school's expensive, it's three years, these waffles much more affordable and I think I don't really love the law. 

I didn't have a plan. I did not have a plan but I had a great friend in Steve and we started talking about things we wanted to build. We weren't trying to change the world with a start up. No, we were just trying to live like college students for as long as we could. We wanted to wake up, be able to work in our pajamas, maybe take a midday nap, play a little World of Warcraft. We weren't setting out to do these huge things. We were just starting with solving a problem we hoped a few other people had, okay? 

No one starts out with this grand plan. No one starts out with this grand vision. We're all just hacking it. We're all just figuring it out. 

And look, I've done my research on commencement speeches. It turns out let me get this right. NPR researched this. About a third of the time speakers tell students to quote change the world. Which is reasonable, that is, that is what I think we all would like to do in some way but maybe it's a little to grandiose, right, where does our world start? It starts with ourselves. It starts with our families and our friends and our loved ones and then perhaps it grows into our communities and our cities and our states and our nations and our worlds but it must start somewhere. With ourselves. 

In other speeches quote things like impossible is nothing and think different and just do it actually those are just slogans for multi-national companies. Ummm no. 

Here's what I wish for every one of you, these two things. 

That you're constantly thinking. 

That you're constantly flowing with ideas. 

That you're challenging yourself and looking and thinking about good things and bad things and smart things and stupid things and all types of things and every now and then taking selfies, but always be thinking. And be active not so much in the sense of physically active although that is very important. Do not spend too much time in front of your connected devices. Be physically active but also take those ideas and don't settle with just having them start doing them. 

Surround yourself with other people who crave this same curiosity and hunger to do things. 

And the secret, the big secret... There is no secret, there isn't, we're all just hacking it. Like I said, anyone who claims to have it all figured out is just lying. We don't. No one does. I don't. None of us do. And that's okay. Because, you know that's the thing, you're getting these commencement speeches from people who are lucky outliers, right? And I'm very well aware of this and the best case scenario they're self-aware of this luck and this fortune and that's another reality. So much of it just comes down to luck. So much of it just comes down to things beyond our control. 

So the best thing you can do is put yourself in situations for those things to happen but also know that every single one of us is just as clueless, as just as curious, as just as insecure about what they're going to do with themselves. There's no blueprint, I promise you. There's no special thing where you push a button and a bookcase opens, none of that exists. 

And you're clearly all entering a job market that as you know is not awesome, alright? Its not. Nothing I can say will change that. We've been given a platform though that none of our predecessors had. I'm talking about the internet, which is not just for cats, okay? It's a big part of it. 

One of the things I still can't even get over. Nine years ago I was graduating and YouTube did not even exist. You can find videos now about soft-scrambling eggs to crochet, to JavaScript, there are so many treasure troves of knowledge on this one platform we almost take it for granted. It's something that is going to allow, yes, a whole new generation of, you know, selfies, but it will also allow a generation of us to become self-starters. Whether we wanna get started on an Etsy store and start selling some jewelry we're making or launching our first Kickstarter campaign for an artistic project or start a business or just learn how to make those darn soft boiled eggs. There's so much knowledge here and the previous generations have merely adopted this technology, we were born with it. Molded by it. I do that in the Bane voice too but I don't wanna... They merely adopted the internet. We were born in it. Molded by it. Thank you.

Incidentally, incidentally, not the first time the Bane voice has been used at a commencement address but it's alright. One of the important hallmarks of this technology though is net neutrality. It is a level playing field, where all bits are equal. Where any one of us with an idea has as level a playing field as any one else. So I ask you, what are you passionate about? What are you curious about? Alright, what do you wanna create? What do you wanna do? Do you wanna learn how to crochet that special kielbasa warmer for the next Bears game? Or, or I realize this is a mixed audience here. Or perhaps, a cheese statue tribute to Aaron Rodgers. Whichever... Like I know we're in mixed company we can at least all agree that we hate the Vikings. Is that right? Alright, I am never going back to Minnesota now. Okay.

But really, there's someone in Oklahoma right now who makes a living, this is serious, doing acapella video game theme song covers.  Amazing. Amazing. That's the internet alright? And what it means is, look, even I don't really know where this is all headed. But you all have an amazing opportunity because where you sit, we're all on the shoulders of giants but you all will be capable of doing in the next nine years will make what Steve and I have done in the last nine look like nothing. That's the nature of innovation. 

These are the things I can't even imagine because you all haven't done them yet. But you will and like I said, there's no blueprint. Life is not a paint by number, it's just a bunch of us figuring it out. But we have a chance in this finite amount of time to do something special right? Something meaningful for ourselves, our friends, our families, our communities and let me emphasize families too. You guys all have an opportunity today with your parents, you're families, loved ones, I'm talking real hugs, okay? Dudes in particular, none of the, that hug stuff, with the two tap. I'm talking bear hug, alright? E

very one of these people, every one of these people, in your friends and family network who have gotten you this far and supported you because these opportunities that are so precious take advantage of them, alright? Seriously, bear hugs okay? Because we have so limited time and there's so much we wanna do. 

Especially now that we got this internet thing man there is stuff there 24/7, can't get off that. But take advantage of it. You've gotta start with yourself, or otherwise the rest will not follow and one of the things that has stuck with me since I was a kid playing way to many video games, this is also when games used to be hard, when you had a limited number of lives, yeah, yeah, not anymore, you guys whippersnappers have it too easy. Games used to have a finite number of lives and when you were on your last life it said there in the top right it said lives remaining zero. And I realized you know it's just like real life. Not withstanding reincarnation or resurrection, we are all playing with zero lives remaining and the thing that I realized even playing those video games way back when was I played my hardest on that last life. 

So my advice to you is this. Play like you have zero lives remaining. Take every opportunity you can. Hold those people who take care of you, who treat you well, hold them close to you because life is short and we have so many opportunities right now and 

I know it may not always feel that way but trust me, just the fact that we are even here having this discussion right now, that's being live streamed across the World Wide Web. Like, this is an amazing opportunity and one we should not take for granted so please, please take full advantage of this opportunity and can you all join me in congratulating the Carthage class off 2014. Congratulations.

Oh happy day! To all the members of the graduating classes, look around you—over the fence on either side. This day is ostensibly about you, but it’s really and equally about your families—all those you love, whether they are biologically related to you or not, who come together with you to celebrate the milestones of your life. They are with you for birthdays, coming of age ceremonies, graduations, weddings, births and anniversaries. And they are with you in the darker moments of life, supporting you in disappointments, depression and the loss of those you love. Indeed, part of what defines a milestone in your lives is that family members gather to share it. 

To the young men in the audience: Graduates and your brothers, cousins and friends, you are still in your early to mid-twenties, too soon at least for most of you to be thinking about families of your own. But as you begin to plot your careers, you should be thinking about how you will combine your work lives with your family lives. Now, I know right now, you’re actually thinking about, “I want a job.” “I want to have a work life.” But, believe me, you will get a job and you should be thinking then about how to combine that career with your family lives. If you imagine yourself as a father, how will you adapt your career to accommodate caring for those you love in what is gong to be one of the most rewarding phases of your life? 

Think hard about your own fathers and grandfathers. Have they had enough time to spend with you? Have they been able to be whole men, developing their caring sides as well as their competitive sides? Have they been able to love and give fully, not only as fathers, but as sons themselves, as husbands, brothers, uncles and friends? What will they say at the end of their lives about what they wished they had done differently, or had more time for? Ask them now and plan your own lives accordingly. 

Think about the different phases of your career. How will you be able to be an equal partner with the person you choose to spend your life with? If you choose to marry a woman or a man who has equal career aspirations to your own, how will you adapt to allow him or her to reach as high as you hope to? Will you be prepared to move if your wife gets a promotion? Will you be prepared to defer your own promotion, so that your husband can take his? Or if one of you actually has to stop working for a while to take care of a child or a parent with particular needs, will you be prepared to do that? 

Do not wait until the choice is upon you to establish and plan for your priorities. You will still be a provider. Providing care is every bit as important as providing cash.  

To the young women in the audience: Graduates, sisters, cousins and friends. As our society is currently structured, you are much more likely to have begun thinking about these issues than your male peers. That’s actually our first mistake. But as you think about your careers, do not automatically assume that it is primarily up to you to balance career and family. Do not choose a career or a specialty within a career on the grounds that it has the flexibility to allow you to do both. Choose a career on the basis of what you are passionate about doing, and then choose a husband or wife or life partner on the assumption that you will be genuinely equal partners, that you will both be breadwinners, but both also caregivers, perhaps for children, for those family members who took care of you, or for each other. 

But then plan for the likelihood that it will not be possible for you both to be breadwinners and caregivers without compromises, no matter how much you lean in—and I want you to lean in. Not only because life throws you curve balls, with children who need more time or more care than others, marriages that crumble, loved ones who get sick, but also because even when you’re making it work, cramming every minute of every day with the frenzy of fitting work and care schedules together, you may decide that is actually not how you want to live.

Plan for the possibility that it will be your spouse who slows down or stops working to support your career, at least for a while. But for that to work, you must rethink what you value in your spouse. If you marry a man, you must see his caring side as every bit as masculine as his competitive side. Depending on your own ambitions, you may out-earn him and your children may call for him first when they wake or hurt in the middle of the night. He may be the greatest logistician your household has ever seen, even if it looks and runs like a sports camp or a fraternity. Look for a man who thinks Don Draper has missed out on what is most important in life; who is secure enough to be able to support you differently than your father or grandfather supported your mother or grandmother; who is confident and competent enough to provide the flexibility and foundation to allow you to reach for the stars.

To the parents and grandparents in the audience: You play a critical role here. Those of you who are here to celebrate the achievements of your sons and grandsons may be thinking that you did not pay for a Tufts degree—and all of you have paid at least in some way—for your boy to be anything other than a primary breadwinner throughout his career. But if you want him to be able to have a family of his own—a healthy, happy family—and if you want him someday to be able to take care of you, then you must support him in any role he chooses. 

And for those of you who are here to celebrate the achievements of your daughters and granddaughters, if they marry a man who makes compromises in his own career to support them, do not question what kind of provider or husband he is. He will be providing what your daughter needs most. 

To the president, trustees, faculty and staff of this great university: Make a commitment as you teach and nurture the classes that come after this one, to model and support healthier, happier lives. Push back against your students’ impulses, honed by their high school efforts to get into top institutions like this one, to fill every minute of every day.  Remind them that time spent hanging out with their friends—talking, laughing, eating, playing—is every bit as important as one more course or extracurricular activity. 

Celebrate idleness. Yes, idleness! The students of creativity have long known what neuroscientists can now actually prove: Our greatest insights and discoveries have come not when we are doubling down staring at a computer screen or into a microscope, but when we sit back, rub our eyes, go for a walk, read a book or give our children a bath.  Isaac Newton did not discover gravity in a laboratory. He was sitting under a tree. The physicist Richard Feynman did his Nobel Prize-winning work when he was watching students spinning plates in a cafeteria. Often you must slow down for your mind to speed up.

To the graduates—all of you: That you are graduating from this institution on this day in this country at this time in history means you are privileged. You are positioned to make a difference in the world. Use that position to claim and defend your humanity. Do not accept a workplace that sees you as a human replacement for an automaton—someone who can work 24/7 and is always able to jump on a plane. Reject time-macho. Refuse to be a face-time warrior.

When your co-workers, and later your employees, compete as to who can put in the most hours to the day, suggest to them that they must be very inefficient workers. Pity them for not having enough depth and breadth to get a life. Judge work by the quality of what they produce, not the number of hours they put in. Stand up for what will increasingly separate you from the robots that will threaten to replace you. Stand up for play—for the leisure that will renew and recharge you. Stand up for love. Stand up for each other, and equally importantly for those who do not have the privilege that you do. Stand up for their right to have a life of meaningful work that earns them a living and the time and resources to enjoy their lives. 

Let me end as I began:  Remember this day—and oh what a glorious day it is—a day of leaving and beginning, of letting go and holding fast. Remember this world—your teachers, mentors, coaches and all the people who took care of you here on this campus, from the groundskeepers to the food servers to the janitors. And don’t worry, if you show any signs of forgetting, the alumni office will come and find you. Remember not only this ceremony but all the celebrations around it—the lunches, brunches, dinners and drinks, with the people you love most in the world who have come to toast your success. 

You will live a long time. Indeed one of my dear friends in the audience is still teaching here at age 85. Most of you can expect to see 100. As you look forward across your lives, think about today as a day that weaves you all together, that strengthens the very fabric of family. And remember that if that family comes first throughout your life, your work will not come second. Your life will come together. 

Thank you.

Welcome graduates. Thank you for including all of us as honorees and including us as part of the University of the People. I even have a cousin who is graduating here today Ð hello, Amelia.

IÕm going to start by telling you a doctor story. I know, I know. This is your graduation, and IÕm going to talk about sick people? But bear with me. I think youÕll see why. And anyway, this is what you get when you put a doctor between you and your diploma.

Several years ago, I was having lunch with a colleague of mine, a pediatrician, and we got into a conversation about a project he was working on. He was trying to create a way of measuring the amount of suffering that children with cancer experienced as they went through chemotherapy, radiation and other treatments. (Sounds like such a great story, huh?) He was thinking if he could design an objective way of measuring the overall well-being of these kids, doctors could make improvements that might reduce how much they had to endure.

The day we talked, however, he was incredibly frustrated. He had crafted a set of questions for children probing all kinds of aspects of their livesÑhow much pain they experienced, what sports they could or couldnÕt play, how happy they were. And he tested the questions in children treated for cancer and children who were healthy school kids. But the questionnaire didnÕt seem to work. The answers weirdly produced almost no difference between the two groups. Here he had sick kids in wheelchairs, oxygen tubing in their noses, hair gone, at threat of their lives. TheyÕd report a bit more nausea and pain than a kid off the school playground. But that was about it. Overall, their responses suggested they had almost equal quality of life. Indeed, the sick kids sometimes reported a higher quality of life than the school kids.

One question asked kids, for instance, can you play basketball? The wheelchair kids would say, ÒSure, I can play basketball.Ó But the school kids would say, ÒNah, I canÕt play basketball.Ó My colleague felt like he had to go back to the drawing board and come up with better questions.

But maybe not. Since we spoke, a pile of research has emerged showing similar results. And it has largely found that the social and emotional quality of life of children with cancer is as good as that of healthy childrenÑand sometimes better. I have come to think that this puzzling research is telling us something useful about how people Ð all of us Ð flourish in life.

Earlier this spring, St. JudeÕs ChildrenÕs Research Hospital in Memphis published results from studying 255 children after treatment for cancer. The average age was just 13. Half described their cancer battle as the most traumatic event of their life. And the only reason the other half didnÕt say so was they had gone on to face worse. One was injured in a drive-by shooting that killed their cousin. Another was displaced by Hurricane Katrina. A third was homeless. Others suffered the deaths of close family. Psychologists had said that most of them would have post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overall these children had lower measures of post-traumatic stress than a matched group of children without cancer.

These researchers found that the experiences of these kids had paradoxically strengthened them. TheyÕd developed closer social connections. They had a greater sense of empathy for others. They had increased emotional strength. They found them doing better, not worse, than the average child.

What was going on here? Normally, if you go through an extended period of extreme sufferingÑpain, deprivation, violenceÑespecially in childhood, it damages and weakens you. Something was different here.

Well, it appears the reason these children grew stronger was due to how the world around them led them to deal with their ordeal. The hospital created an environment full of people who cared about them, understood them and their difficulties, and helped them see beyond their disease to what was worth striving for. The children had their family all around and supporting them. They were connected with other children in similar straits and forged bonds of belonging and self-belief.

These were kids, in other words, who were helped to find their sense of meaning and purpose as well as find people who could share it with them. And the combination was so powerful it could carry them through terrible travails. But for many of the healthy kids, it ironically remained an untapped source of strength and resilience.

Experiences of terrible adversity can sometimes bring out this kind of flourishingÑfor instance, when neighbors come together after a natural disaster and discover they feel more alive than they had. But it doesnÕt take suffering to find out how potent a feeling of purpose and connection to a community can be. And I suspect that you have experienced something very much like that feeling here in college and discovered how much it can make you grow.

The aim of college is not complicated. It is to learn and try stuff so you can expand as a human being. Find what you care about. Maybe even figure out who you are and what you are here on this rock for.

I had by no means figured out who I was or what I was when I graduated from college. I would still have some years of wandering before I settled on medicine and writing and family and the other ways I would try to make my difference. But it was a special thing to be in a place like this with others who were also trying to figure out their spot in the world. I suspect you too had those late night dorm conversations, that random tutor or professor who took you under wing and believed in you, the encounters with people and ideas you never imagined.

I arrived at college to find I was sharing a room with a long-haired, born-again Christian humanities major and an Air Force ROTC electrical engineer. We were, on paper, totally incompatible. But before you knew it, weÕd joined together to put on a Wednesday 2 a.m. college radio show that was doomed within a month because none of us wanted to get out of bed for it. We ran what turned out to be an illegal business from our room supplying the dorm with Twinkies, soda, and beer for pizza money. I joined a campus Amnesty International campaign for political prisoners and at one point nearly traveled to communist Poland on some cockamamie scheme we came up with to get illegal writings out from prisoners there, only to chicken out.

And I think youÕve had your own inadvisable experiments, too, I am sure. But because they gave you a sense of connection to others and direction, they are a big part of the reason whyÑdespite the slog of coursework, the all-nighters, the sometime failures and personal setbacksÑitÕs why most of you will long remember college, and Carolina, as among the best years of your lives.

Ultimately, it turns out, we all have an intrinsic need to pursue purposes larger than ourselves, purposes worth making sacrifices for. People often say: find your passion. But thereÕs more to it than that. Not all passions are enough. Just existing for your desires feels empty and insufficient, because our desires are fleeting and insatiable. You need a loyalty.

The only way life is not meaningless is to see yourself as part of something greater: a family, a community, a society. And that is the best part of what college has allowed you to do. College made it easy. It gave you an automatic place in the world where you could feel part of something greater. The supposedly Òreal worldÓ you are joining does not.

You face certain traps in moving on from here. One ugliness of the Òreal worldÓ is its readiness to have you define your purpose in terms of an enemy Ð and IÕm not talking about Duke. IÕm talking about those we compete with or simply disagree with. The purpose for far too many is less to build something better than to destroy the other side. No tactic is too low as long as you can get away with it. More and more of public and private life seems defined by the strength of oneÕs power rather than the strength of oneÕs ideas.

And it is surprisingly seductive, youÕll find when you get out there. We all find victories easier to come by when they are about knocking others down instead of winning them over. But we also eventually find that these are empty satisfactions.

Our other tendencyÑespecially when faced with this kind of nakedly adversarial worldÑis to narrow down, focus on just our own material needs and success. Why get involved in more when it so often involves dealing with the antagonistic and the unkind? ItÕs so much simpler and less messy to hold ourselves back and stay removed in our own private realm.

The trouble is, you will wake up one day asking yourself why it is so unfulfilling to simply exist. You cannot flourish without a larger purpose. And thatÕs lucky in a way because our society cannot flourish without your reaching for a larger purpose, either.

But what purpose? People and their experiences again offer a clue. And what people find is that they have no more transcendent experience than getting to see and help others find their own purpose, to achieve their own potential. And your parents and teachers today can tell you a little about that incredible feeling. The lasting wonder and beauty of places like this is their commitment to building people up rather than beating them down. And our great hope is that you carry that ethos with you into the rest of your life.

One thing I came to realize after college was that the search for purpose is really a search for a place, not an idea. It is a search for a location in the world where you want to be part of making things better for others in your own small way. It could be a classroom where you teach, a business where you work, a neighborhood where you live.

The key is, if you find yourself in a place where you stop caringÑwhere your greatest concern becomes only youÑget out of there. You want to put yourself in a place that suits who you are, links you to others, and gives you a purpose larger than yourself worth making sacrifices for.

For me, that place was a hospital. I found great satisfaction in learning how to do difficult things that were so valued by others. I liked having the privilege of getting to know people so intimately as a doctor. I also liked the kind of person a hospital forced me to be. Things in a hospital donÕt always work. The people you take care of arenÕt always pleasant or, certainly, happy. But everyone has to matter. Everyone deserves respect and our effort to understand them and help them achieve whatever well-being is possible for them. After all, isnÕt that what we want for ourselves? If so, then that has to be what we seek for othersÑwhether they are a 90-year-old with dementia or a 13-year-old with cancer.

Nobody here knows where the place for you will be. But graduates, we do know there is a place for you. In fact, there are likely many of them. You are going to even create some of those places yourselves, and the world is going to benefit from that. That is the reason we are all excited for you todayÑand the reason you too can be glad to move on.

Congratulations to you all. Thank you for all youÕre going to do, and thank you for making me a Tar Heel!

I don’t want to take an opportunity commencing at such an august institution in not throwing down just some short bits of advice. I mean, you’d do it if you were up here, wouldn’t you? Just a little bit. These are ten bits of graduation advice you won’t see on any BuzzFeed listicle.

Remember my credentials, though. I was on welfare. I became dependent on the state for both food and medical treatments. I became a single parent at a time when nobody would trust me with a ficus plant. Other than that, I’ve been sort of a model citizen. So take what applies, and leave the rest, that’s what I’m saying.

Right now, in your class, I know you guys are all having your kumbaya moment and you’re hugging each other and saying how great you all are. But there are gunners, who are really just heads and shoulders above everybody, and they’re bound for glory. You know what? They’re not the ones that are going to change the world. It’s somebody that was underestimated. It’s somebody that you do not know that’s really going to kill it. I guarantee it. I guarantee it as somebody who has worked with young people. And you know what? Maybe you’re that person. I just want to say.This has been a theme, and I just want to echo, do what’s in front of you. When you leave school, you’ve got your loans weighing down on you, you’ve got parents saying “What the hell are you going to do with all this?” Just do what is in front of you. Don’t worry about the plot to take over the world. Just do what is in front of you, and do it well. I think that if you concentrate on your plot to take over the world you’re going to miss things.

Journalism is like housekeeping. It’s a series of small, discrete acts performed over and over. It’s really the little things that make it better. So don’t think about the broad sweep of your journalism. Just do a good job on what’s in front of you. Working on your grand plan is like shoveling snow that hasn’t fallen yet. Just do the next right thing.

I think you should be a worker among workers. I say that because we’re in a brand of narcissism and personal brand. Don’t worry about branding yourself, other than not being naked on your social feeds. I don’t think it’s really important to work a lot on brand development. I believe in social media engagement, and I’ve got a little problem with Twitter as Ed points out. It’s more important that you fit in before you stick out, that’s what I’m saying.

Number five is the mom rule. Don’t do anything you couldn’t explain to your ma. All these big, ethical conundrums where — Ed and me will run a three-day symposium on ethics, when in fact, if you can’t explain what you’re up to with your mother without her saying, “Honey that seems a little naughty to me, what you’re doing. It seems a little bad, that isn’t nice.” Don’t do it. Don’t go near it. Use the mom rule. Call her up. She’s a great resource.

Don’t just do what you’re good at — that’s number six. If you stay in your comfort zone, you’ll never know what you’re capable of. As has been pointed out, you need to learn to experience frustration, and you need to experience that frustration as a teachable moment, and you need to humble yourself and ask for help. Can you help me build your website? Yes, you can.

Being a journalist is permission for life time learning. Don’t be a know-it-all. Ask the people around you.

Number seven is, be present. I don’t want to go all Oprah on you. So many people spend time like their phone right now is burning a hole in their pocket. Like, who’s on there? What are they talking about? And you know what’s going on when you’re thinking about that? Your whole life. Your whole life is going on.

I can’t tell you the times I’ve gone to some extraordinary event where some big throbbing brain is talking. Everybody’s walking around like this. They never look up. And it’s like, if your head is in your phone, the scenery never changes. So don’t worry about documenting the moment. Experience the moment.

I have close to half a million followers on Twitter, but the person who needs to know what I’m doing is me. Here I stand. This is what I’m doing. I got some pictures earlier, and I might tweet them out later, but Twitter isn’t waiting to see what I think. I need to experience this extraordinary moment as it unfolds, and maybe later on I’ll put a photo on Facebook or tweet something out.

Look who you’re speaking to. Get your face out of your phone. Do not be a bystander in your own life. You’ll miss everything.

You should take responsibility for, not just the good stuff, but the bad stuff. I have noticed in leadership, in covering people over and over, it’s the people who are capable of taking ownership over failure and apologizing very directly for their shortcomings that succeed.

We’re all broken, in one way or another. To pretend or expect otherwise is stupid. And when you come up short, just say so, don’t make excuses. Excuses — they explain everything and they excuse nothing. Just be honest about what you did wrong, take ownership, and resolve to do better.

I think this is very important, number nine, is to be honest. This is a tactical approach these days. People always say, “I love that thing you’ve got where you just say whatever’s on your mind. You just come right out with it. It’s like, you know, the truth.” It’s like, well, that’s not really a tactic. That’s a way of living. That’s a way of being.

When you’re honest with someone, when the door opens and you have to have a difficult conversation, just walk through it and have the difficult conversation. Show the people in front of you the respect to be honest with them.

One of the things I hate about being in California is you guys always — when you talk, you sound like you’re agreeing with each other. You’re not! You’re having — oh I totally hear what you’re saying and I’m sure we can work with that. We obviously gotta loop in some other — and it’s like, no, you’re wrong, I’m right, here’s why.

When you develop this gimmick, this reputation for telling the truth, people tend to listen to what you have to say.

And last thing is, don’t be afraid to be ambitious. I’m living a pipe dream, and I’m living it because I wanted it. I wanted it really badly. I was 34 years old, washed out of my profession, on welfare, terrible reputation, single parent, and I just met the woman who would be my wife. And she said, “Where do you see yourself five years from now?” I said, “Well, I want to be figure on the national media scene.” And she said, “Well honey, you’re unemployed and you’re on welfare now.” I know! I’m just trying to articulate a goal.

The other thing I see is the people who doubt you, like you’re gonna get out of here and you’re gonna have friends who work for Morgan Stanley or whoever they working for, they’re working for a hot dot-com. And they say, well, good luck with that, you’re going to sink below your waist. Those are your friends, the people who doubt you. Because you’re going to make fools out of them.

I often think of the people who never thought I would do anything. Those are your allies. Those are your little secret friends. You keep them close.

I think that what’s important — I was on a panel with Gay Talese, the great New York Times journalist, great narrative journalist. And he was, people were asking him about the great age of journalism. We’re Boswells. We sit in a cubicle and we write about people who write. That we end up in this meta, crazy place where we don’t have anything original, we’re just putting a little topspin on everything that’s going by.

And the great Gay Talese said, we are outside people. We leave, we find people more interesting than us, and we come back and we tell their stories.

Right now, everything looks impossible. Think back when you applied to be here. How many bodies did you crawl over to get here, for one thing? You’re extraordinary just by getting in here. And now you made it to the end — improbably, not everyone probably did, but you’re here. You’re standing here. So when you see the big incline ahead of us, just keep in mind these last two years. You totally beat the odds, and you fucking landed it. You’re here.

Odds against you, here you stand. Grads of the Berkeley School of Journalism. Resolve to be worthy of that. Resolve to do important things with that. Be grateful for the good things that have come your way.

This small group before you, ladies and gentlemen, I’m sure will make a big dent in this world. Maybe somebody should write a story about that.

My deepest congratulations to you, the family; you, the faculty; but most of all, you guys. I’m proud of you and I don’t even know you.

Good morning and happy Mother’s Day! Let’s hear it for the mothers.

I’d like to begin with an announcement: To the Chancellor, to the trustees, to the faculty, to the parents and grandparents who are smiling so hard their faces are starting to ache. To the siblings texting descriptions of their mad impatience up in the bleachers, to all of you my announcement is this: I hereby declare the Class of 2014 to be, without question, the greatest graduating class in the history of Syracuse University.

The most intelligent. The most accomplished. And certainly, the best looking. (Yes, I thought you would agree). By the way, I think you graduates are off the hook for Mother’s Day. The vision of you in a cap and gown, trust me, beats a nice ‘Best mom ever’ mug any old day. The mothers agree.

At least for one day your parents feel, and I’ve felt it, an immeasurable sense of relief.
First of all, they know where you are. And second, no kidding, their hearts are absolutely overflowing with joy.

So good, I’ve now officially fulfilled the most important initial requirement of a proper commencement speech, pandering shamelessly to the graduating class and to motherhood and mothers everywhere. I hope you appreciate it because this is a pretty scary gig.

This place is known as the Loud House. I have no idea why. And it’s been the scene of many Orange triumphs.

As most of you know, Syracuse has been the scene of two of the most celebrated speeches delivered anywhere in recent years, speeches by two gifted writers, Aaron Sorkin and George Saunders. Not only were Aaron and George particularly eloquent, they’re also Syracuse people. Family. Which leads to the absolutely sensible question: What in God’s name is this outsider doing here?

I can’t know for sure, but I doubt it’s because, as the editor of The New Yorker, I’m the world’s foremost judge of talking dog cartoons. By the way, I am.

And I’m pretty certain that I’m the only person alive whose job in large measure is based on an ability to distinguish a funny talking spaniel from a really boring talking spaniel.

There are jobs and there are jobs. But I think it’s something else.

I think part of the reason I’m here has something to do with the family for whom I work. The Syracuse family that runs the New Yorker and much else. The Newhouse family. Even on winter days with your eyes tearing from the cold, you must have noticed the buildings on campus, the Newhouse School of Public Communications, cue the cheering of the communications school. The Newhouse family is a press family that is press shy. But let me thank them just this once publicly, not only for the gifts they’ve provided to your great institution, but for the gift of absolute editorial freedom that they have provided to my colleagues and to me.

Now, the remaining obligation of a Commencement address is to have, well, something to say. And this is what I would say three decades after I threw my own absolutely ridiculous graduation hat up into the air. And by the way, there’s some great ones out there.

I have every hope for all of you as individuals. I hope for your good health. I hope that you are blessed with family and friends to love. I hope you’re able to care for your parents, and for your children. I hope you find a way to make a living that thrills and nourishes you. I hope, in other words, that your lives are happy and deep and interesting and loving lives.

But I also hope you know, as of today you are inescapably citizens of the world.

Last year at convocation George Saunders spoke of the virtue of kindness. And he spoke of kindness for the most part as a private virtue, a texture of human interaction, a way of being, really between and among friends, family, colleagues and even strangers. And he was absolutely right. To be kind—to be the opposite of heedless or cruel—is a simple-sounding but wholly essential virtue.

But all of us are also members of a community, many kinds of communities that stretch from the local to the global. And this demands of you many things. Being a member of a community demands that you pay taxes, obey the law, maybe join a school board, volunteer to help the poor and disabled. But the one demand of living in a community and in the world that I want to talk about today is the demand placed on you for vision.

It’s traditional on graduation day for your elders to admit, as if it were ever a secret to you, that we, the old and the soon-to-be-so have screwed up the world on a colossal scale. We then go on to say we’re very sorry but now we’re going fishing and now we’re depending on you to fix everything. Have a ball!

In fact, that’s a dodge, a dumbshow of civilizational false modesty. In so many ways modern life is immensely better than ever before. Over time, we human beasts, or at least the large and lucky percentage of us, have emerged from the state of nature that was, in the words of Thomas Hobbs, ‘solitary or nasty, brutish and short.’ And through the development of law and political organizations, science and culture, our lives are less solitary, less poor, less nasty, brutish and short. Not for a second do I want to suggest that life is better for everyone. We have not eliminated cruelty, stupidity, poverty or violence. Oppression reigns from Damascus to Pyongyang to even Moscow, but the movement forward, while full of detours and disasters, the stuff we call history, is unmistakable.

Think of it—the percentage of the world’s population destined to live in a state of absolute poverty has in just the past 50 years dropped by half. The percentage of the world that lives in some form of relative political liberty has vastly expanded, from Eastern Europe to Latin America. And although a modern media guarantees we are at least dimly aware of bloody conflict from Ukraine to the Central African Republic, the scale of the world’s conflicts, according to scholars like Stephen Pinker, is, overall, markedly less than any time in human history.

And we are healthier. My colleague at the New Yorker, Atul Gawande, has written about a typical medical operation in the 19th century performed by a surgeon named Liston. Because there was no effective anesthesia at the time, Liston had to work at fantastic speed. But while trying to amputate a patient’s leg, he also managed to amputate the fingers of his assistant. Whoops. Both the patient and the assistant died of subsequent infections. The sight of all this medical mayhem was so disgusting that a spectator in the operating theater died of shock. Thereby, as Gawande writes, this was a surgical procedure with a 300 percent mortality rate. A big body count. And not at all unusual for the times.

So we’ve gotten better at these things. So much of what used to kill us is now a matter of an antibiotic or a pill. Operations on the heart, the brain, can often be performed without blood at all.

As Gawande writes, we are now in an era in which a teenage boy can undergo aorta surgery on a Thursday and be well enough to sprain his ankle playing sports the following Saturday. The technological refinement of our abilities to care for the human body has been nothing short of miraculous. At the height of the Roman Empire, life expectancy was about as old as you are now, 22. By 1900, no so long ago, global life expectancy was 32. Now it’s close to 70 and in the United States we live into our 80s and some of you, God help you, will limp past 100.

As for technological advance, I hardly need to tell you: The capacity to communicate efficiently and instantly, to compute, to navigate, to take 5,000 graduation pictures as you will today, to record a voice, to read the news in any language and then share it, to access the literary and musical wealth of all of human history, to do all of these things, is as simple as reaching into your pocket.

You have a remote control for your life waiting for you.

We have also, locally and globally, made advances in the quality and range of human empathy. Take the life of the great Lou Reed, who studied here at Syracuse. He was not some distant historical figure. He and his band The Velvet underground were pivotal figures in rock ‘n roll in the New York art scene, and he died just last October. And yet when he was a teenager in the late ’50s, his parents tried to, quote, solve, unquote, his bisexuality by submitting him to electric shock therapy. Try to imagine that. Many years later he said about the treatment, “They put electrodes on your head and the effect is that you lose your memory and become a vegetable. You can’t read a book because you get to page 17 and you have to start right back on Page 1 again.”

It was around the same time that American magazines advertised a hideous burning cream that could lighten the skin so that African Americans could somehow pass more easily into white racist society. Now we live in a world where the gains of the Civil Rights Movement of the ’50s and ’60s and the women’s movement of the ’70s at least seem to be well established. And we’re deep into a liberation movement of the 21st century, the LGBT movement. Marriage freedom, unthinkable so recently, opposed by absolutely everyone but a small number, is now, I’m happy to say, a national inevitability. In 50 years, in other words, we have gone from putting electrodes on the head of a teenager to, quote, cure his homosexual feelings, to a growing national consensus that celebrates the marriages, the equality, and the humanity of gay men and lesbians. Hallelujah.

And yet, if the world is on such upward trajectories, aren’t you just free to pursue your own private lives and tend your private gardens? Needless to say, my triumphalist description of global advance is full of holes and gigantic, horrifying exceptions. If you think racism in America is disappeared, you know nothing of Trayvon Martin. If you think racism in America is disappeared, you haven’t tried to drive or hail a cab while black or brown. If you think sexism is dead in America, you haven’t taken note of the unbearable maleness of corporate boardrooms in New York or Silicon Valley. If you think sexism in America is dead you haven’t noticed that women are still paid markedly less than men for comparable work. If you think homophobia is dead, you are not watching the last round of Republican primary debates when a gay combat soldier in Afghanistan asked the candidates about his rights in the military and members of the crowd booed him and the candidates, cowards one and all, failed to stand up for him.

But all of that is self evident. I said I wanted to speak of the demands on you of vision. What I mean is that the rate and the way the world advances is dependent on us and now most definitely as of this day on you. Nothing is inevitable. If this day means anything, it means that you are now in the contingent of the responsible. You must be kind, yes, but you must also look beyond your own house. We’re depending on you for your efforts and your vision. We are depending on your eye and your imagination to identify what wrongs exist and persist, and on your hands, your backs, your efforts to right them.

All of us have 2020 vision when it comes to the outrages of the past. As my friend the philosopher Anthony Appiah reminds us, “Once pretty much everywhere beating your wife and children was regarded as a father’s duty. Homosexuality was a hanging offense. Waterboarding was approved, in fact invented, by the Catholic Church. Through the middle of the 19th century the United States and other nations in the Americas condoned plantation slavery. Many of our grandparents were born in the states where women were forbidden to vote. And well into the 20th century lynch mobs in this country tortured, hanged and burned human beings at picnics. We look back on all this now with a self satisfied notion that we are beyond such cruelties. We are so far beyond them that we cannot imagine a moral sensibility that condoned and defended them. Because after all, we are so advanced, we are so good.

But we are not so good. We are humans, and, as such, we are, without our quite knowing it, always living at least partly in the dark. What conditions do we tolerate now that require our, your, visionary capacity and effort? What will we look back on with incredulous shame and how will we begin to right it?

What gnaws at you? And what will you do about it?

Is it the way we treat and warehouse our elderly as our population grows older? Is it the way we isolate and underserve the physically and mentally disabled? Is it our absurd American fascination with guns and our insistence on valuing the so called rights of ownership over the clear and present danger of gun violence? What will we—what will you—do about the widening divides of class and opportunity in this country? You are, dear friends, about to enter an economy that is increasingly winner take all. Part of this is the result of globalization. But do we just throw up our hands and say that’s the way it is? And what about our refusal to look squarely at the degradation of the planet we inhabit? In the last election cycle many candidates refused even to acknowledge the hard science, irrefutable science, of climate change. The president, while readily accepting the facts, has done far too little to alter them. How long are we, are you, prepared to wait?

No one is insisting you all become global politicians or selfless activists. Some of you will spend nearly all of your time pursuing private, professional, and personal comforts and rewards. But that does not rule out your spending at least some significant time in the service of all. Of all of us. Of seeing the world clear and taking part, in some way large or small, in making it better.

This is what comes with citizenship. This is what comes with a diploma. So while we all congratulate you today on in effect joining the world, we also ask that you help us see that world anew. See it more clearly. And then act. So that a generation from now, when I’m gone and you’re sitting at your own child’s graduation, maybe here at Syracuse on Mother’s Day, why not, you will know you’ve done your part for your son, for your daughter, and for everyone in this loud house and well beyond.

Thank you and congratulations!

I would first like to remind you of something that, as college educated individuals that you are – Congratulations on that, btw -- you surely already know. This very moment, you are sitting on a giant rock that is hurling through space; silently and very fast. You are tied to this rock by an invisible force. You can play with this force the way you might play with a puppy pulling the other end of a rope. If you lift your foot off the ground, the force pulls back until you get tired and put your foot back down. Or you can throw a ball up in the air and the force throws it back at you. It’s a fun little force to play with.

At the same time, you are being bombarded by little tiny bursts of energy. About 8 minutes ago and 100M miles away, pairs of atoms collided and shot out these little bombs toward this rock that we are glued to. If you close your eyes and feel the warmth on your face, that’s those little tiny bombs crashing into your head and jiggling the atoms in your skin. If you can see me right now, that’s because a bunch of those little bombs bounced off my head and then poked you gently in the eye.

I mention these facts for a couple of reasons. The first reason is: if you get bored during my speech, you can now tune out to play the foot-lifting game with Earth or think about how as our rock rotates, those little bombs start hitting your face at a slightly different angle. The second reason I mention these facts is that I might need them for a point I plan to get to later.

Social convention dictates that in a speech like this, I am meant to share some thoughts about the value of a college education. I’ll skirt that topic just a bit and instead talk about some of the reasons to go to college. After all, all of you made that choice some time ago and this is a particularly apt occasion for you to reflect on that decsion and consider whether it made sense.

So, what are some of the reasons that people go to college?

Perhaps the most obvious one is money. According to our best estimates, you will earn 22 percent more than if you had chosen not to go past high school. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s also not a life-changing number. Making $60K a year is better than making $50K a year – about $10K better in fact -- but it probably won’t have a dramatic, qualitative impact on the way you live.

Another common reason to go to college is because you are supposed to. We do many things simply because there are explicit or implicit expectations that we will do them, so we follow along. I, for instance, almost always eat sushi with chopsticks, paella with a fork, and popcorn with my hands. There’d really be nothing wrong with eating popcorn with chopsticks – in fact, now that I think about it, that sounds kind of fun – but we don’t always reflect on our choices; sometimes we instead follow the most “obvious” path.
Some people go to college precisely because they may not be expected to. They are all the more eager to go to college because their parents did not. Going to college means that much more to them because they would be the first ones in their family to do so. The very idea of college and the achievement that it represents can be more important than the palpable benefits it bestows on its graduates.

Women used to go to college to find suitable husbands. Luckily, those days are now gone – in fact, telling high school boys to go to college to find a wife would probably be better advice; around 60% of college students today are female – but I mention this fact of recent history simply to remind us that the factors behind people’s decision that twelve years of schooling is not enough, range far and wide.

Now, here is the main point of my speech. All of the aforementioned reasons are the wrong reasons to go to college. The right reason to go to college is so you can find new ways to awe yourself by reflecting on how fascinating the world we live in is.

We are actually on a giant rock hurling through space. Our great-great-etc-grandmother truly was a ferret-like creature with poisonous spikes on her back. Male bees don’t have fathers. If you take a cup of coffee and stir it as hard as you’d like, there is at least one molecule that will end up at the exact same place where it was before you started stirring. It’s a crazy interesting world we are living in. The reason to go to college is exactly the same as the reason, now that you have graduated, to continue to both (i) discover and (ii) reflect on the mind-blowing reality that encompasses us.

Now, what to do if you went to college for one of the wrong reasons? Luckily, that’s no problem because, as a human, you possess a special capacity that Sartre calls transcendence. Take any thing in the world: a table, a human. There are facts about that thing – the table is made of wood, the person went to Shepherd University. These facts cannot be changed. Moreover, for a table, these facts constitute the entirety of the table’s existence. A human, in contrast, is special. There are facts about you, but there are also attitudes that you take toward those facts. You choose what meaning to give to your college education.

The choice that you make here is an important one because it may serve as a keystone in the narrative that explains to you who you are. That said, you will also be free to revise and expand this narrative over time.

I have. There are many crucial elements to the story I tell, to myself and to others, about how it is that I’m here. There is of course the crucial role played by an angel named Ms. Ames. There is a certain pride in the fact I had to clean other students’ toilets to earn money for textbooks my first semester at Harvard. There is delight in the fact that many of my closest friends in college are now distinguished professors in Computer Science, Philosophy, Economics. To me, these are important elements of my life plot.

You know, This American Life did an episode about how I got into college, and one insightful observation they made, in the words of Michael Lewis, was this: “These stories we tell about ourselves-- they're almost like our infrastructure, like railroads or highways. We can build them almost any way we want to. But once they're in place, this whole inner landscape grows up around them. So maybe the point here is that you should be careful about how you tell your story, or at least conscious of it. Because once you've told it, once you've built the highway, it's just very hard to move it.”

But what I recently realized is this: even though it is difficult to move the highway, education lets you fort of fly over it and see it in a different light. The most recent twist in my story, and I think the most important one, is that I’ve learned to use education simply to delight myself. You can also decide, if you wish, that this is the primary reason why college matters to you.

You can decide to cultivate a habit of transforming the seemingly mundane into the realistically fantastical that it is: as light hits those leaves right there, little tiny bursts of energy give the tree momentary strength to gobble up the carbon from the CO2 around it. The stolen carbon is then incorporated into the tree. Trees, as it turns out, grow out of the air, not out of the ground! That is a beautiful thing to contemplate. And getting the special glasses that allow me to look at the world this way, well for me, that is a really good reason that I went to college. Perhaps it can be for you as well. But also remember that you can always change that.

I wish you way more than luck.

Thank you, Chancellor Wu. It’s an honor to be here this afternoon. It’s great to see so many families, friends, and guests.

Let’s give a hand to all the family members who are here today, supporting their graduates.

Now let’s take a minute and applaud all of the graduates who have worked so hard to get here today.

Congratulations.

After you cross the stage today, you will become the newest graduates of the oldest law school on the West Coast.

To be blunt, I envy you.

I envy what’s before you in life. Most of all, I envy all the fresh opportunities that lie ahead for you to make a difference in the world.

You see, my hope for you is this: you will learn, in the coming years, that what matters is not the size of your paycheck. It is not whether your name is on the law firm door. You will learn that in the profession of the law, it’s not how much you make that matters, but whether you make a difference.

Today, you join a new family. It is the family that is the alumni of the Hastings College of the Law. This is a family that has demonstrated an incredible commitment to public service—an incredible commitment to making a difference.

Let me tell you about three members of this family.

The first one is a Hastings graduate from the Class of 1989.

This man was a whip-smart, affable man with a patient ear. He was born in Grass Valley, in the Gold Country. Yet he lived much of his adult life throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Without question, he was one of the most talented American diplomats in the Foreign Service. He dreamed, someday, of returning to the West Coast to be a law professor.

This man could have been an extremely successful partner at a big law firm. But he was from Hastings, and from the time he served in the Peace Corps in Morocco, he knew that the path of public service was the one for him. He dedicated himself to advancing the cause of world peace—to making a difference.

He paid for that dedication with his life.

Please join me in a moment of silence for Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Thank you.

Now let me tell you about a Hastings graduate from the Class of 1958.

This man is recognized as a political powerbroker in California. But before that came to pass, he was Co-Chair of the California delegation to the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

At the convention, there was a battle for the party nomination for president of the United States. This was between two candidates—George McGovern and Hubert Humphrey.

Those were contentious times in the country, and this was a contentious convention. The social revolution of the 1960s was bearing fruit. The Vietnam War was in play. Civil rights were in play. The dawn of disco was upon us.

The Democratic Establishment backed Humphrey. But the California delegation, reflecting the wishes of the state it represented, wanted an end to Vietnam. Those 271 delegates stood ready to cast their votes for the anti-war McGovern. So the Humphrey supporters tried to unseat them.

The California co-chair—the man from Hastings—rose to the occasion. He stood on the convention floor, and looked those party leaders straight in the eyes.

“Give me back my delegation,” Willie Brown demanded.

“Seat my delegation.”

It was a great moment in public life. Brown’s was an argument built more on passion than parliamentary procedure. But he prevailed. Brown alone kept the California delegation, and its votes, on the floor.

Willie Brown was from Hastings. And he made a difference.

Let’s move to a third member of the Hastings family.

This graduate was from the Class of 1976.

She was fresh out of Hastings when she began her service as an aide to Congressman Leo Ryan.

In the 1970s, Ryan represented California’s 11th district, not far from here. During that time, he began to read and hear disturbing accounts about the Peoples Temple. This was a religious community—a cult, as we would learn—that had moved to Guyana from San Francisco. There were rumors that the members—and they included many, many children—were being abused. So Ryan decided to lead a congressional investigation to find out what was happening, and what could be done to help.

The Hastings graduate went with him.

She knew that this would be a dangerous mission. Before she left, she wrote out her will. But she, and Ryan, and those who traveled with them, saw what they suspected to be a serious wrong—and flew halfway around the world to try to make it right. They wanted to use their congressional position to make a difference.

They paid a price for doing so. When Peoples Temple members ambushed the team on the tarmac in Jonestown, Ryan and four others were killed. The Hastings graduate was shot five times in the ambush.

Jackie Speier waited twenty-two hours for help, and she still carries pieces of those bullets within her. But they have never stopped her from a life in public service—as a United States Congresswoman, as a California State Senator, as a California State Assemblywoman, and as the youngest person ever elected to the San Mateo Board of Supervisors. Most recently, she has focused her attention on curbing sexual assault on college campuses. This is a concern that I share, and I am counting on Representative Speier as an ally as we address this important issue.

Jackie Speier is from Hastings, and to this day, she is making a difference.

These are dramatic examples, yes, but the point remains. I urge you, as you take your place in the legal profession, to consider what difference you will make. Because, fundamentally, making a difference as a lawyer means devoting time for public service. This is what makes the practice of law a profession, and not just a job.

Let’s consider what lawyers do:

They keep the doors of the courthouse open to those who seek vindication and fairness.

They make sure that crime victims have a champion, while defendants’ rights are protected.

They fight for civil rights, and for human rights.

They hold people accountable—landlords and tenants, employers and employees, even the president him—or her—self.

Now, you have received a Hastings education. So you know the role that public service plays in giving a career, and a life, true purpose. You have the lessons of the guiding stars—those Hastings graduates—who came before you.

You also possess the hard work you invested in yourself during the last three years. And added to this is your experience in a law school that is justifiably lauded for the diversity of its student body.

When it comes to diversity at elite American law schools, Hastings leads the way. And we are doing what we can at the other four University of California law schools to catch up to Hastings on the diversity front.

This brings me to the final member of the Hastings family I’d like to tell you about.

Her name is Clara Foltz.

How many of you have heard of her?

Clara was a single, divorced mother with five children. But she was determined to become a lawyer.

Clara double-checked the qualifications required for the California state bar. She discovered she met all of them…except one:

She was not a white man.

So Clara rewrote the law that governed the practice of law in California. Then she successfully lobbied in Sacramento for its passage. But Clara—who was herself not a person of color—didn’t just want to take care of herself. She wanted all Californians to benefit. And so her bill, titled the Woman Lawyer’s Bill, replaced the phrase “white man” with these words:

“Any citizen or person resident of this state”.

After spending time at Hastings, Clara went on to become the first woman lawyer in California. She helped create the United States public defender system. In her free time, she taught women law students in her office. And when Clara died, in 1934, the Governor of California was one of her pallbearers.

She was from Hastings, and she made a difference. Eighty years after her death, that difference can be seen all around you.

Take a look. You and your classmates all come from different backgrounds, different races and ethnicities, different genders. You share in this incredible achievement—one that began with just one woman who, against all odds, saw a wrong and resolved to make it right.

Now it’s your turn.

So take the time today to celebrate this graduation.

But as you celebrate this moment, and reflect on all the glories and travails of the last three years, don’t forget to also cast your eyes forward.

What will be your path?

What difference will you make?

I, for one, am excited to see what this, the Class of 2014, will accomplish.

Thank you.

Thank you, President Sexton. On behalf of the honorees, let me express my thanks to NYU. And congratulations from all of us to you, the Class of 2014, and to your families, especially your parents. This is a special day to celebrate your achievements and to look forward to your lives ahead.

Your NYU education has not only provided you with a foundation of knowledge; it has also, I hope, instilled in you a love of knowledge and an enduring curiosity. Life will continue to be a journey of discovery if you tend the fires of curiosity that burn brightly in all of us.

Such curiosity led Eric Kandel, here at NYU, to his lifetime goal, to discover the chemical and cellular basis of human memory. A few years after his graduation, he was doing research on cats. But he had the idea of focusing on an animal with a simpler, more fundamental brain: the California sea slug. His colleagues all but ridiculed him for the idea. They "knew" that the study of the lowly sea slug was irrelevant for understanding human memory. Kandel's surgically-skilled collaborator deserted him. To get up to speed on sea slugs, he had to go abroad to study. But Kandel persisted and, in 2000, his curiosity won him the Nobel Prize. It was, as you must have guessed, for deciphering the chemistry of memory in humans, as revealed by his research on sea slugs. Kandel's life, I believe, demonstrates how a persistent curiosity can help us reach ambitious goals, even with great roadblocks in the way.

A second tool for lifelong intellectual growth is a willingness to listen carefully to others. These days, technology allows us access to a great breadth of perspectives, but it also allows us to limit what voices we hear to the narrow range we find most agreeable. Listening to others, especially those with whom we disagree, tests our own ideas and beliefs. It forces us to recognize, with humility, that we don't have a monopoly on the truth.

Yankee Stadium is a natural venue for another lesson: You won't succeed all the time. Even Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio failed most of the time when they stepped to the plate. Finding the right path in life, more often than not, involves some missteps. My Federal Reserve colleagues and I experienced this as we struggled to address a financial and economic crisis that threatened the global economy. We brainstormed and designed a host of programs to unclog the plumbing of the financial system and to keep credit flowing. Not everything worked but we kept at it, and we remained focused on the task at hand. I learned the lesson during this period that one's response to the inevitable setbacks matters as much as the balance of victories and defeats.

There is an unfortunate myth that success is mainly determined by something called "ability." But research indicates that our best measures of these qualities are unreliable predictors of performance in academics or employment. Psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth says that what really matters is a quality she calls "grit"--an abiding commitment to work hard toward long-range goals and to persevere through the setbacks that come along the way.

One aspect of grit that I think is particularly important is the willingness to take a stand when circumstances demand it. Such circumstances may not be all that frequent, but in every life, there will be crucial moments when having the courage to stand up for what you believe will be immensely important.

My predecessor at the Fed, Chairman Ben Bernanke, demonstrated such courage, especially in his response to the threat of the financial crisis. To stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth, he took courageous actions that were unprecedented in ambition and scope. He faced relentless criticism, personal threats, and the certainty that history would judge him harshly if he was wrong. But he stood up for what he believed was right and necessary. Ben Bernanke's intelligence and knowledge served him well as Chairman. But his grit and willingness to take a stand were just as important. I hope you never are confronted by challenges this great, but you too will face moments in life when standing up for what you believe can make all the difference.

Having dwelt for a moment on failure and grit, let me turn to the deeper meaning that underpins grit and can carry us beyond failure. The hard work of building a life that makes a difference is much easier to sustain when you are passionate about what you pursue. When I first came to the Federal Reserve 37 years ago, I was struck by the passion of my colleagues for the mission of the Fed. And these many years later, each day at work, I see the importance of that passion to carrying out the Fed's duties effectively. If there is a job that you feel passionate about, do what you can to pursue that job; if there is a purpose about which you are passionate, dedicate yourself to that purpose.

Finally, I hope that you can find joy in the lives you choose. You are completing one important phase of your life today and embarking on an amazing new adventure. Serious decisions about life surely lie ahead, but take the time to savor the joys, large and small that come along the way. Share those joys with others, and share a laugh when you can.

In closing, thank you again, on behalf of myself and the other honorees. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. Congratulations and good luck to the Class of 2014.

Thank you President Huddleston, distinguished guests, honored faculty, and parents…but especially thank you to the University of New Hampshire’s graduating class of 2014. It’s so fabulous to be back. I’ve already partied at the Field House, at Murkland, at the Alumni Center and the Presidents place…just like old times. I first came to this campus when I was just 14 and my older cousin Mark was starting as a freshman. I sat on a bench in front of Thompson Hall and I thought – this is what college is supposed to feel like. Mark paved the way for my older sister to come here, then me, then my younger cousin Alex…who met his wife here. So my family has deep roots here and deeper debt.

And it really does feel like I was just here yesterday…. So much so, that when I was asked to be the commencement speaker, my first reaction was, I am way too young. And then my sister so kindly pointed out that I was 42, which I then realized made me pretty much exactly twice your age…which I then realized pretty much sucked.

But then I moved onto a worse thought, which was: I’m not good enough to be the commencement speaker…” and ultimately it was that horrible thought that made me say yes.

It did, because in that thought I realized there might be something during my few extra rounds on this planet that I had learned that might be of use to you. And it has to do with self-doubt, that “I’m- -not-good-enough” motto of living, something I’m a bit of an expert on.

My sister and I grew up on a poor street in a rich town. It was bad enough that everyone in America was wearing Seventies clothes, but we were in hand-me-down Seventies clothes. And to make it worse, I had the energy of the Tasmanian devil and the grace of a pile of pick-up sticks. My hair was perpetually full of knots. Stains on the clothes. Goodness, I was the perfect target for bullies. And I was bullied. Every day. For years. And something happens to you, when everything you do is fuel for ridicule and mockery. Eventually, you drink the bully koolaid and self-doubt takes.

People talk about the dangers of rose-colored glasses, but let me tell you, the lenses of self-doubt are far worse. They are nasty. Thick and filthy… they’re covered in swamp scum and mold -- there’s like a family of snails living on them. And they’re nearly impossible to see past.

Were it not for my family loving me, brushing out my tangled hair, fostering my love of books and drawing and creating, I’m not sure what I would have done. They helped me find my relief in story telling. Reading, writing, drawing, were moments of escape from myself. Lying in bed at night, I’d concoct magical, grand, epic and yes sometimes musical adventures, stories of wrongs righted, justices served, bullies revenged. I guess it should have been a sign, but I was wearying those darned lenses of self-doubt and I and couldn’t see it.

And then something happened. I noticed I wasn’t alone in this feeling of not being good enough. It started right after I made my first friend again. I need to take a second to acknowledge her. She’s here and she was the first person to step between the bullies and me. Her name is Jen and she’s been my friend for 30 years now. So with her, as the two over. Jens, we entered that horrible self-doubt festering incubator called high school. You know what I mean; it’s like all warm and full of puberty and hair…and it smells, and while you’re just trying to get used to your grown-up face and body, your GPA is pulsing in the center like the eye of Sauron. And before you know it, the lenses of self-doubt are so thick you need like a big ole’ strap to hold them up. I remember looking around at my fellow classmates and wondering if anyone thought they were good enough.

And then I met him. Here a UNH, in fact, a student, who for whatever magical reason never doubted himself. He was magnetic, but kind, infectious and motivating. His name was Jason MacConkey and he could sell you a car while convincing you to write him a love song. Our time together at UNH was some of the best years of my life: Yes, I lived at Stoke Hall, but creatively I had Ham-Smith, Gay Nardone’s dance company, my KD gang, and wonderful class called foods and dudes. Of course back then things were a bit different here at UNH. Kegs were still legal on campus, grunge was the fashion, bathing was undervalued…The many houses of the greek system were at their most powerful and at war with the bureaucrats…there were wildcats, endless snow, debauchery; it was like Game of Thrones, I’m telling you. Such good times. Really.

But I will say that, during those years, while I could admire Jason’s comfortable acceptance of himself, his motivating spirit, I was not quite ready to let go of doubt for myself. But in April of our junior year Jason was killed in a boating accident. And life knocked those lenses of doubt off my face so hard I went right down with them.

When you wake up so young with such loss, there is no doubt, only grief. And in that grief you see clearly. The world drips with color. Death exaggerates the significance of life. And you suddenly know better than to waste a second doubting. I loved New York City and books and storytelling. And so I graduated and moved to New York, found Book publishing, which led to book writing, then to screenplay writing. And over a course of decade I settled back into life, but I also unknowingly slipped back on those lenses of doubt. I remember looking at Columbia film school website afraid to apply. Because I wanted to go so badly; but feared I wasn’t good enough. The only reason I sent in that application because of Jason. He was a reminder that if there was a chance to live the life I wanted, I owed it to him to go for it. And I got in. For two decadent years and only $60,000+, I was going to make movies.

In film school, the first thing you study is character. And you learn that insecure characters, characters that don’t think much of themselves, are not very interesting, they aren’t inspirational, or hopeful and no one wants to watch them. Ouch. But the only characters worse than insecure characters are perfect characters. They are lifeless, boring, generic, they never feel authentic. The best characters, the ones we love, who inspire us, who we want to remember forever, are flawed, and one-of-a-kind. The only characters not good enough are ones who aren’t complex, or messy, or vulnerable, the ones who aren’t real.

While in film school, I met a man named Phil Johnston. He was in my opinion the most talented person in the program. An Emmy-award-winning journalist, with the most gloriously twisted sense of humor. You might know him from a film he wrote called Cedar Rapids or as my co-writer on Wreck-it Ralph. Anyway, back in grad school, he thought I was good enough to work with. Again and again he thought that. I would always act so surprised that someone so good would want to work with me.

And one day he made me promise to do something that would change my life forever. He said: “you can be as insecure as you want in your life, but just promise me you’ll leave that insecurity out of your work. Just know, you’re good enough.” And I did.

Six months later, I had two film options and I got my first paycheck as a screenwriter. One year later, Phil I were writing Wreck-it Ralph together. And then…and then came…FROZEN.

So while I stand here before you, a person so far from perfect that there isn’t even a subway line to perfect anywhere near me. Gypsy cabs won’t even go near my neighborhood of imperfection, I’m THAT not perfect… maybe… I am enough.

And if I’ve learned one thing, it’s that self-doubt is one of the most destructive forces. It makes you defensive instead of open, reactive instead of active. Self-doubt is consuming and cruel and my hope is today that we can all collectively agree to ban it.

Think about it: how many hours do you spend analyzing yourself? Your looks, you’re hair, too thin, too straight, too curly; how much time do you spend being disgusted by yourself, cringing over the dumb thing you said, worrying you won’t get a date because while you’re hilarious in your head but you speak it sounds like you’re explaining tax code. Think about all the crazy ways you feel different from everyone else…and now take the judgment out of it…what you’re left with is such a holy dynamic, original character, the kind that could lead an epic story.

And now think to the moments in your life when you forgot to doubt yourself. When you were so inspired that you were just living and creating, and working. Pay attention to those moments, they’re trying to Reach you through those lenses of doubt and trying to show you your potential.

One side note: being good enough doesn’t let you off the hook to be lazy. It’s not an excuse to spend your twenties on your parents’ couch admiring your enough-ness.

It’s not like a free pass to get out of changing and growing and maturing. No, it’s just that when you are free from self-doubt, you fail better, because you don’t have your defenses up, you can accept the criticism. You don’t become so preoccupied with that failure that you forget how to learn from it, you forget how to grow. When you believe in yourself, you succeed better. Hours spent questioning, doubting, fearing, can be given over to working , exploring, living .

You will still fail a lot. In fact, people to your face will say, “that is not good enough .” But just don’t make it about yourself. If you can learn to not take it personally, you will be able to listen to the constructive criticism and find it inspiring. And it might motivate you and show you that you are capable of far more than you ever imagined. I will say if we made the first draft of FROZEN, if I’d been too insecure and defensive to listen to the criticism and notes, if I wasted my time trying to prove I was good enough instead of using that time to make FROZEN what it needed to be, it would have been a far different movie and I guarantee you, I would be standing here. Thing is when you accept that who you are is enough; you become the biggest participant in making your work and even your relationships better.

And get this, they say that the number one thing driving bullies is insecurity, so we ban self-doubt and we kill two birds with one stone right here.

So what do you say? Can we go ahead and ban self - doubt right now?

Okay, so now that self-doubt is out of the way, think about it; what would you dare to do?

I won’t go too English Lit on you, but there’s this line in Raise “ High the Roof Beam Carpenters ” by J. D. Salinger , when Seymour says to his brother, Buddy, an inspiring writer, that the first question he’ll be asked when he dies is, “Did you have your stars out?” I love that idea. That you have stars in you, bright vibrant stars that could shine if you worked hard enough to get them out.

But while, you might have those stars, you won’t see them if you’re wearing the big-ole nasty lenses of doubt. Take them off and see how bright the sky is.

So if I can leave you with one thing today and I’m going to ask your parents to please remind you if you ever forget, please know that from here on out, you are enough, dare I say , more than enough. Thank you and congratulations!

I think the only real news here today is your graduation from this great university. First of all, congratulations. I’m impressed that your achievements have attracted so much media attention. As well they should.

I’m so happy to be here to share this important day. My own college graduation is still a thrilling memory. In fact, I had breakfast this morning with one of my college classmates, Barclay Rives, now a proud parent of graduate sitting out here. One of my favorite family photos is of my busting-with-pride father at Harvard. A college dropout, he never got to wear his own cap and gown. So he crammed his 6-foot self into mine. He looked silly but radiant. I hope all of you in the Class of 2014 are lucky enough to have at least one parent or someone who helped raise you here today. A shout-out to all the parents, grandparents and others in the audience. My own children are recent college grads, so I know how full your hearts are today because your kids have worked so hard and achieved so much.President Hatch suggested that I speak to you today about resilience, and I’m going to take his wise counsel. But I’m not quite finished with the parents part.

Very early last Thursday, my sister called me and she said, ‘I know dad would be as proud of you today as he was the day you became executive editor of the New York Times. I had been fired the previous day, so I knew what she was trying to say. It meant more to our father to see us deal with a setback and try to bounce back than to watch how we handled our successes. “Show what you are made of,” he would say.

Graduating from Wake Forest means you have experienced success already. And some of you – and now I’m talking to anyone who has been dumped – have not gotten the job you really wanted or have received those horrible rejection letters from grad school. You know the disappointment of losing or not getting something you badly want. When that happens, show what you are made of.

I was in China recently, and some of you know the New York Times website has been blocked by censors there for more than a year. That means in China that citizens cannot read the most authoritative coverage of their country. Every time I reflexively tried to open the New York Times website, I got the message that said, “Safari cannot open the page,” which made me become more and more furious.While I was I Beijing, one of our Chinese journalists, Patrick Song, was detained for hours by authorities. The government meant to scare and intimidate him. Why was he detained? Simply because he worked as a truthful journalist. So what did he do? He came right back to work and quietly got on with things. “I did what I believe, and that makes me fearless,” Patrick told me after his ordeal.

You know, New York Times journalists risk their lives frequently to bring you the best report in the world. That’s why it is such an important and irreplaceable institution. And it was the honor of my life to lead the newsroom.

A couple of students I was talking to last night after I arrived, they know that I have some tattoos. One of them asked me, “Are you gonna get that Times ‘T’ that you have tattooed on your back removed?” Not a chance.

I faced a little challenge of my own not long ago. I got run over and almost killed by a truck in Times Square. You may begin to call me Calamity Jill, but stay with me here. But with the seventh anniversary of that accident approaching, I wrote an article about the risk to pedestrians with three Times colleagues who had also been struck and hurt. We mentioned a 9-year-old boy in the top of our story who had been hit and killed by a cab early in the year. A few days after the story was published, I got an email from Dana Lerner. It began, “Thank you for the article you wrote in last Sunday’s Times. The boy you mentioned was my son, Cooper Stock.” I met with Dana last Thursday and, you know, Cooper was just killed in January, but Dana, her husband and others are already working on a new law to make the streets safer. She is taking an unimaginable loss and already trying to do something constructive.We human beings are a lot more resilient than we often realize. Resilient and perseverant. And there are so many examples of this. For me professionally, my heroes are Nan Robertson, a ground-breaking reporter at the New York Times, and Katharine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post, which broke the Watergate story. They both faced discrimination in a much tougher, more male-dominated newspaper industry and they went on to win Pulitzer Prizes.

My colleague Jim Risen, who is standing up against an unfair Washington leak investigation, is another hero.

I co-authored a book about Anita Hill, who testified about sexual harassment before an all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1990s. The Senators portrayed her as being – as one of her detractors so delicately put it – “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.” She turned that potential humiliation into a great career teaching at Brandeis University and writing books that tell truth to power. Anita was one of the many people who wrote me last week to say they are proud of me. Those messages are so appreciated.

Some of you have faced danger or even a soul-scorching loss, but most of you haven’t. And leaving the protective cocoon of school for the working world must seem scary. You will have a dozen different jobs and will try different things. Sure, losing a job you love hurts, but the work I revere, journalism that holds powerful institutions and people accountable, is what makes our democracy so resilient. And this is the work I will remain very much a part of.My only reluctance in showing up today was that the small media circus following me would detract attention away from you, the fabulous Class of 2014. What total knockouts you are.

What’s next for me? I don’t know. So I’m in exactly the same boat as many of you. And like you, I’m a little scared but also excited. You know, I don’t really think Coach Manning could find as much use much use for me, but right after this speech, I have booked a private session with Andy Chan, whose career-counseling operation is a model for universities around the world.

When I was leaving my office for the last time, I grabbed a book off my shelf, Robert Frost Speaking on Campus. In closing, I’m going to leave you with some wisdom from the Colby College commencement speech the great poet gave in 1956. He described life after graduating as piece of knitting to go on with. What he meant is that life is always unfinished business, like the bits of knitting women used to carry around with them, to be picked up in different intervals. And for those of you who have never knitted, think of it as akin to your Tumblr: something you can pick up from time to time. My mother was a great knitter and she made some really magnificent things. But she also made a few itchy and frankly hideous sweaters for me. She left some things unfinished. So today you gorgeous, brilliant people, get on with your knitting.

Thank you Bevan, thank you all!

I brought one of my paintings to show you today. Hope you guys are gonna be able see it okay. It’s not one of my bigger pieces. You might wanna move down front — to get a good look at it.

Faculty, Parents, Friends, Dignitaries... Graduating Class of 2014, and all the dead baseball players coming out of the corn to be with us today. After the harvest there’s no place to hide — the fields are empty — there is no cover there!

I am here to plant a seed that will inspire you to move forward in life with enthusiastic hearts and a clear sense of wholeness. The question is, will that seed have a chance to take root, or will I be sued by Monsanto and forced to use their seed, which may not be totally “Ayurvedic.”

Excuse me if I seem a little low energy tonight — today — whatever this is. I slept with my head to the North last night. Oh man! Oh man! You know how that is, right kids? Woke up right in the middle of Pitta and couldn’t get back to sleep till Vata rolled around, but I didn’t freak out. I used that time to eat a large meal and connect with someone special on Tinder.

Life doesn’t happen to you, it happens for you. How do I know this? I don’t, but I’m making sound, and that’s the important thing. That’s what I’m here to do. Sometimes, I think that’s one of the only things that are important. Just letting each other know we’re here, reminding each other that we are part of a larger self. I used to think Jim Carrey is all that I was...

Just a flickering light

A dancing shadow

The great nothing masquerading as something you can name

Dwelling in forts and castles made of witches – wishes! Sorry, a Freudian slip there

Seeking shelter in caves and foxholes, dug out hastily

An archer searching for his target in the mirror

Begging to be enslaved

Pleading for my chains

Blinded by longing and tripping over paradise – can I get an “Amen”?!

You didn’t think I could be serious did ya’? I don't think you understand who you're dealing with! I have no limits! I cannot be contained because I’m the container. You can’t contain the container, man! You can’t contain the container!

I used to believe that who I was ended at the edge of my skin, that I had been given this little vehicle called a body from which to experience creation, and though I couldn’t have asked for a sportier model, it was after all a loaner and would have to be returned. Then, I learned that everything outside the vehicle was a part of me, too, and now I drive a convertible. Top down wind in my hair!

I am elated and truly, truly, truly excited to be present and fully connected to you at this important moment in your journey. I hope you’re ready to open the roof and take it all in?! (audience doesn’t react) Okay, four more years then!

I want to thank the Trustees, Administrators and Faculty of MUM for creating an institution worthy of Maharishi’s ideals of education. A place that teaches the knowledge and experience necessary to be productive in life, as well as enabling the students, through Transcendental Meditation and ancient Vedic knowledge to slack off twice a day for an hour and a half!! — don’t think you’re fooling me!!! — but, I guess it has some benefits. It does allow you to separate who you truly are and what’s real, from the stories that run through your head.

You have given them the ability to walk behind the mind’s elaborate set decoration, and to see that there is a huge difference between a dog that is going to eat you in your mind and an actual dog that’s going to eat you. That may sound like no big deal, but many never learn that distinction and spend a great deal of their lives living in fight or flight response.

I’d like to acknowledge all you wonderful parents — way to go for the fantastic job you’ve done — for your tireless dedication, your love, your support, and most of all, for the attention you’ve paid to your children. I have a saying, “Beware the unloved,” because they will eventually hurt themselves... or me!

But when I look at this group here today, I feel really safe! I do! I’m just going to say it — my room is not locked! My room is not locked! No doubt some of you will turn out to be crooks! But white-collar stuff — Wall St. ya’ know, that type of thing — crimes committed by people with self-esteem! Stuff a parent can still be proud of in a weird way.

And to the graduating class of 2017 — minus 3! You didn't let me finish! — Congratulations! Yes, give yourselves a round of applause, please. You are the vanguard of knowledge and consciousness; a new wave in a vast ocean of possibilities. On the other side of that door, there is a world starving for new leadership, new ideas.

I’ve been out there for 30 years! She’s a wild cat! Oh, she’ll rub up against your leg and purr until you pick her up and start pettin’ her, and out of nowhere she’ll swat you in the face. Sure it’s rough sometimes but that’s OK, ‘cause they’ve got soft serve ice cream with sprinkles! I guess that’s what I’m really here to say; sometimes it’s okay to eat your feelings!

Fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about your pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what’s happening here, and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear.

So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect, so we never dare to ask the universe for it. I’m saying, I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it — please! And if it doesn't happen for you right away, it’s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order. It’s party size!

My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t believe that was possible for him, and so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant, and when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive.

I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.

That’s not the only thing he taught me though: I watched the affect my father’s love and humor had on the world around me, and I thought, “That’s something to do, that’s something worth my time.”

It wasn’t long before I started acting up. People would come over to my house and they would be greeted by a 7 yr old throwing himself down a large flight of stairs. They would say, “What happened?” And I would say, “I don't know — let’s check the replay.” And I would go back to the top of the stairs and come back down in slow motion. It was a very strange household.

My father used to brag that I wasn’t a ham — I was the whole pig. And he treated my talent as if it was his second chance. When I was about 28, after a decade as a professional comedian, I realized one night in LA that the purpose of my life had always been to free people from concern, like my dad. When I realized this, I dubbed my new devotion, “The Church of Freedom From Concern” — “The Church of FFC”— and I dedicated myself to that ministry.

What’s yours? How will you serve the world? What do they need that your talent can provide? That’s all you have to figure out. As someone who has done what you are about to go do, I can tell you from experience, the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is.

Everything you gain in life will rot and fall apart, and all that will be left of you is what was in your heart. My choosing to free people from concern got me to the top of a mountain. Look where I am — look what I get to do! Everywhere I go – and I’m going to get emotional because when I tap into this, it really is extraordinary to me — I did something that makes people present their best selves to me wherever I go. I am at the top of the mountain and the only one I hadn’t freed was myself and that’s when my search for identity deepened.

I wondered who I’d be without my fame. Who would I be if I said things that people didn’t want to hear, or if I defied their expectations of me? What if I showed up to the party without my Mardi Gras mask and I refused to flash my breasts for a handful of beads? I’ll give you a moment to wipe that image out of your mind.

But you guys are way ahead of the game. You already know who you are and that peace, that peace that we’re after, lies somewhere beyond personality, beyond the perception of others, beyond invention and disguise, even beyond effort itself. You can join the game, fight the wars, play with form all you want, but to find real peace, you have to let the armor fall. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don’t let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.

It’s not big enough! This painting is big for a reason. This painting is called “High Visibility.” It’s about picking up the light and daring to be seen. Here’s the tricky part. Everyone is attracted to the light. The party host up in the corner who thinks unconsciousness is bliss and is always offering a drink from the bottles that empty you; Misery, below her, who despises the light — can’t stand when you’re doing well — and wishes you nothing but the worst; The Queen of Diamonds who needs a King to build her house of cards; And the Hollow One, who clings to your leg and begs, “Please don’t leave me behind for I have abandoned myself.”

Even those who are closest to you and most in love with you; the people you love most in the world can find clarity confronting at times. This painting took me thousands of hours to complete and —thank you — yes, thousands of hours that I’ll never get back, I’ll never get them back — I worked on this for so long, for weeks and weeks, like a mad man alone on a scaffolding — and when I was finished one of my friends said, “This would be a cool black light painting.”

So I started over. Whooooo! Welcome to Burning Man! Some pretty crazy characters right? Better up there than in here. Painting is one of the ways I free myself from concern, a way to stop the world through total mental, spiritual and physical involvement.

But even with that, comes a feeling of divine dissatisfaction. Because ultimately, we’re not the avatars we create. We’re not the pictures on the film stock. We are the light that shines through it. All else is just smoke and mirrors. Distracting, but not truly compelling.

I’ve often said that I wished people could realize all their dreams of wealth and fame so they could see that it’s not where you’ll find your sense of completion. Like many of you, I was concerned about going out in the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself!

My soul is not contained within the limits of my body. My body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul — one unified field of nothing dancing for no particular reason, except maybe to comfort and entertain itself. As that shift happens in you, you won’t be feeling the world you’ll be felt by it — you will be embraced by it. Now, I’m always at the beginning. I have a reset button called presence and I ride that button constantly.

Once that button is functional in your life, there’s no story the mind could create that will be as compelling. The imagination is always manufacturing scenarios — both good and bad — and the ego tries to keep you trapped in the multiplex of the mind. Our eyes are not only viewers, but also projectors that are running a second story over the picture we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script and the working title is, ‘I’ll never be enough.’

You look at a person like me and say, “How could we ever hope to reach those kinds of heights, Jim? How can I make a painting that's too big for any reasonable home? How do you fly so high without a special breathing apparatus?”

This is the voice of your ego. If you listen to it, there will always be someone who seems to be doing better than you. No matter what you gain, ego will not let you rest. It will tell you that you cannot stop until you’ve left an indelible mark on the earth, until you’ve achieved immortality. How tricky is the ego that it would tempt us with the promise of something we already possess.

So I just want you to relax—that’s my job—relax and dream up a good life! I had a substitute teacher from Ireland in the second grade that told my class during Morning Prayer that when she wants something, anything at all, she prays for it, and promises something in return and she always gets it. I’m sitting at the back of the classroom, thinking that my family can’t afford a bike, so I went home and I prayed for one, and promised I would recite the rosary every night in exchange. Broke it—broke that promise.

Two weeks later, I got home from school to find a brand new mustang bike with a banana seat and easy rider handlebars — from fool to cool! My family informed me that I had won the bike in a raffle that a friend of mine had entered my name in, without my knowledge. That type of thing has been happening ever since, and as far as I can tell, it’s just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it while letting go of how it might come to pass.

Your job is not to figure out how it’s going to happen for you, but to open the door in your head and when the doors open in real life, just walk through it. Don’t worry if you miss your cue. There will always be another door opening. They keep opening.

And when I say, “life doesn’t happen to you, it happens for you.” I really don’t know if that’s true. I’m just making a conscious choice to perceive challenges as something beneficial so that I can deal with them in the most productive way. You’ll come up with your own style, that’s part of the fun!

Oh, and why not take a chance on faith as well? Take a chance on faith — not religion, but faith. Not hope, but faith. I don’t believe in hope. Hope is a beggar. Hope walks through the fire. Faith leaps over it.

You are ready and able to do beautiful things in this world and after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices: love or fear. Choose love, and don’t ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.

Thank you. Jai Guru Dev. I’m so honored. Thank you.

President Aoun, thank you for your very generous introduction and thank you for the invitation to be here on this very, very special day. Jim Bean, Henry Nasella, members of the board, faculty, parents, friends, and especially the brilliant and charismatic class of 2016.

The Garden is about as good as it gets for a commencement. All you have to do is just look up there at the banners heralding the Boston Bruins’ Stanley Cup championship in 2011. I know some of you come from somewhere else, but you’re here. The 17th Celtics championship banner thanks to the second coming of the “Big Three.” And with my chauvinism of 28 years representing the state in the Senate, I’ll tell you this is a living reminder that Boston is the number-one sports town anywhere. Now, at the moment, for the Red Sox “anywhere” just happens to be first place, while the Yankees are in last. So don’t let anyone tell you that our country is not moving in the right direction.

Now, graduating class, I got to tell you, you really do look spectacular. I want you to – I mean, just look around you. Classmates of every race, religion, gender, shape, size – 85 countries represented and dozens of languages spoken. You are the most diverse class in Northeastern’s history – in other words, you are Donald Trump’s worst nightmare. Now, you may not know it, but there is at least one thing that truly unites you: You’re all going to be in really big trouble if you forget that Sunday is Mother’s Day.

Now, to the parents who are here – moms and dads – if you feel anything like I did when my daughters graduated, your emotions have to be mixed – a little bit sad, a little bit relieved – incredibly proud, and absolutely blown away by how short the interval is between diapers and diplomas.

Now, speaking of blown away, I want to congratulate you guys for just getting here in time for this ceremony. I’m told you had to report at 8:00 a.m.

Well – I mean, I got to tell you, that’s either crazy early or crazy late depending on whether you actually went to bed. But why would the last night be different from the rest of your college career, right?

Now, I’ve given a few commencement speeches before, and the biggest challenge is always to follow everything that’s come before you, particularly the student speakers. And I want to thank Annika and Ben, and I want to thank and Distilled Harmony for making my job a lot tougher today. Thank you.

I really want you to know that I accept this honor with great humility, and particularly because Northeastern was kind enough to bestow an honorary degree on my daughter Vanessa last year, who was involved in a global health program which you recognized. I come here absolutely promising not to sugarcoat reality because that is the last thing that you need. No one here needs to be told that life can be a struggle, whether it’s over grades or affording tuition or something more complicated – friends, family, illness, or the death of a loved one. No words of mine can change those realities, and no lecture can lessen the loss.

And as we were reminded earlier, you are still mourning the tragic loss of Victoria McGrath and Priscilla Perez Torres. Even before, on Patriot’s Day 2013, when Victoria was among those hurt by a terrorist’s bomb, this community felt the weight of a wounded world. So this morning, we grieve and we celebrate all at the same time. And in a way, there is no better shorthand description of life itself. And no better two-word summary of this gathering, I think, today than, “Northeastern strong, Huskies strong.”

Now, I have learned – I have learned that resilience is really just the beginning of what Northeastern is all about. Service is at the heart of this institution. So it’s no surprise that Northeastern’s effort to keep faith with those who keep America safe is actually unparalleled. We can be proud that Northeastern graduates veterans at a rate 30 percent above the national average. And to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, from one veteran to so many others, I am proud to say that the class of 2016 is the rule, not the exception. Thank you, Northeastern, and thanks to all of you who have worn or wear our nation’s uniform.

Now, I am honored this morning to address a university family that thankfully is unafraid, utterly unafraid to look beyond our borders and into the future. And it’s also almost cliche to say that you have global vision, but Northeastern really does, and it’s different. President Aoun tests the limits – your bold commitment to experiential learning, your leadership on the environment, the opportunities for international study, a new campus in Silicon Valley, and cutting-edge research in things like high-rate nano-manufacturing. And class of 2016, believe me, if you are mastering a technology that your parents can’t even pronounce, you are doing something right.

And just think, after today you’re going to have a leg up on Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. You’ll actually have a college degree. In fact, Northeastern’s example should speak to every one of us about the massive transformation that is taking place around the world. Northeastern’s gone global. Our leading corporations are going global. Health and medicine and film are going global. And you don’t have to be great at math to understand that our economy can’t grow if we don’t sell things to the 95 percent of the world’s customers who live in other countries. You don’t have to be a doctor to understand that we can’t be healthy if we can’t fight things like Ebola and Zika that may originate overseas but makes us just as sick as the people they first hurt far, far from our shores. And many of you were in elementary school when you learned the toughest lesson of all on 9/11. There are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere, tens of thousand miles away, who are determined to take their own lives while they target others. Not in a clash of civilizations, but in an assault, a raw assault on civilization itself.

So I think that everything that we’ve lived and learned tells us that we will never come out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful country on Earth can remain great by looking inward and hiding behind walls at a time that technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt. The future demands from us – the future demands from us something more than a nostalgia for some rose-tinted version of a past that did not really exist in any case. And I think that everyone here, especially the class of 2016, understands that viscerally, internally, intellectually. You’re about to graduate into a complex and borderless world. You heard President Aoun talk in his description about the view from space. You’re about to embark on careers that will take many of you to companies not yet founded, using devices not yet developed, based on ideas not yet conceived. That is how fast things are moving. And that doesn’t mean you have to succumb to science fiction; you’re not going to all be replaced by robots, because the economy of tomorrow will have enormous space for those with the energy, the training, and the courage to compete.

And Northeastern has made sure that you have that and more, because this university is blessed with a global vision and so are you its graduates now. Believe me, that is critical, because you’re entering a world where thinking globally is absolutely essential to seizing opportunities and confronting the challenges that we face.

When I was younger, we had more than our share of national traumas, including a long and bloody war in Southeast Asia. But it was also a time when the dividing line between ideologies was simpler, when the primary forces shaping our world were governments of recognized states.

Today, we face a world that is much more complicated, less hierarchical, where non-state actors play a central role; where disturbing images and outright lies can circle the globe in an instant; where dangers like climate change, terrorism, and disease do not respect borders or any of the norms of behavior; and where tribal and sectarian hatreds are as prominent as they have been in centuries. Now, for some people, that is all they need simply to climb under the sheets, close their eyes, and wish the world away. And shockingly, we even see this attitude from some who think they ought to be entrusted with the job of managing international affairs.

It seems obvious that understanding to – the need to engage with the greater world, with the wider world should be a threshold requirement for those in high office. And yet the specter of isolationism once again hovers over our nation. I thought we had learned the lessons from the 20th century when an isolationist foreign policy and a protectionist tariff policy contributed to two global wars and the Great Depression.

Well, the desire to turn inward and to shut out the world may be especially seductive in an era as complicated as this. But it is not a responsible choice for the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet – which happens to also be the leader of the free world.

Now, as Secretary of State, let me assure you: when you consider the range of challenges that the world is struggling with, most countries don’t lie awake at night worrying about America’s presence; they worry about what would happen in our absence.

So we cannot be seduced. For us, the lessons of history are clear.

We don’t see an excuse for inaction. We see a mandate to lead. Because the greatest challenges that our world confronts are best addressed – and in some cases can only be addressed – by good and capable people working in common cause with citizens of other nations.

You often hear politicians talking about American exceptionalism, and indeed, this nation is exceptional. But remember, please, we’re not exceptional because we say we are and keep repeating it; we’re exceptional because we do exceptional things.

In other words, greatness isn’t about bragging. It’s about doing. It’s about never being satisfied. It’s about testing the limits of what we can achieve together – of what America and its partners can accomplish in the world. And that is exactly what we are trying to do with the United States already now, today, more deeply engaged on more important issues, in more parts of the globe, than ever before in our history. And we are profoundly conscious of the gravity of the challenges. In the words of the Haitian proverb, there are mountains beyond the mountains.

One of those mountains is the effort to safeguard future generations from the harmful effects of climate change. I am proud to say that the United States is leading the way together with many other nations, and last month, with my granddaughter on my lap, I formally committed the United States to set an example for the 196 nations that have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions and make progress towards a low carbon energy future.

I want you to think about that, because with just a few exceptions – including, I am sad to say, an embarrassing coterie of naysayers and science-deniers here in the United States – the whole world has now, in Paris and in New York, for the first time accepted the need for a revolution in how we produce and use energy.

Ladies and gentlemen, last March was the hottest March in recorded history; last year, the hottest year in recorded history; the last 10 years, the hottest decade in recorded history; the one before that, the third hottest. The facts are simply staggering. And yet, despite all the science, one of my former colleagues thought it would be persuasive to walk onto the floor of the Senate with a snowball in his hand and point to it as evidence that climate change is a hoax. Well, I hate to tell him it proves something, that’s for sure, but not what he intended.

At the same time, just in the past four years, a record $230 billion was spent in the United States of America in response to extreme weather events. Just the other day in Houston they had 17 inches of rain in 24 hours. That is the entire amount of rain – more than – than they had last year in the entire summer. But just imagine if we had put even a small fraction of that 230 billion into efforts to prevent or at least prepare for the worst impacts of climate change.

And there’s one more thing to remember. Don’t believe the doubters who claim that we have to make a choice between protecting the environment or growing the economy. That’s a lie. There are millions of jobs to be created, businesses to be built, fortunes to be made in tapping the potential of renewable energy, and I hope that many of you will share in that future.

In Paris last December, we took an unprecedented step with our first ever international agreement to combat climate change. It is literally, though – I mean, it isn’t the solution in itself because it’s not going to guarantee we hold the Earth’s temperature to a warning of 2 degrees centigrade. But what it does is it sends a massive signal to the marketplace for private entrepreneurs, for scientists, for creative minds to go to work to find the alternative, for the next Elon Musk, for the next Steve Jobs, whoever it is that’s going to produce the battery storage or the ability for us to solve this problem. Paris is the beginning of what we have to do to meet this challenge.

And in the years ahead, we will need an all-out global commitment to clean air, clean harbors, clean coasts, renewable energy, and the preservation of our endangered ocean and marine resources. And I say to you today with certainty, this is one of the great challenges of our time.

And hand-in-hand with this challenge is another mountain to scale – the effort to eliminate poverty from the world. Now, your instant reaction may be to say wow, that’s just too big, that’s not possible. But the truth is it’s not only possible, we’re making enormous progress in trying to achieve it right now.

Today, extreme poverty worldwide has fallen below 10 percent for the first time in history. The revolution that is taking place on a global basis has brought hundreds of millions of people in India, hundreds of millions of people in China into the middle class. And while that’s welcome news, we’re not satisfied because 700 million people still have to survive on less than what it costs for us to grab a couple of Dunkin Donuts a day, because the gap – the gap that was referred to earlier between rich and poor – remains far too wide.

So at the UN last fall, the world came together and agreed to move forward on an agenda that not only will reduce poverty further but will ensure that every boy and girl can attend school, that every mother gets the health care that needs to survive, and that every available resource is used to win the fight against epidemic diseases. After all, my friends, we defied predictions by stopping Ebola. Remember? Experts said that a million people would be dead by Christmas of 2014 without action. Well, we took action. President Obama had the foresight to send 3,000 troops to West Africa to build capacity, to provide care and aid, and to stem the spread of the epidemic. And now, thanks to unprecedented global response – global response, not one country, not turning inwards and avoiding responsibility but accepting responsibility – today the most affected countries are virtually Ebola-free.

There is absolutely no reason – there is absolutely no reason to believe that we can’t do the same for malaria and the same for the Zika virus. Right now, if we uphold and continue our commitments to critical global health programs in Africa, we can see the birth of the first AIDS-free generation – an extraordinary accomplishment.

And yet another mountain that we have to climb, which stands in the way of the calm that we want in our lives and the stability that we need to achieve many of the things we want to achieve, is the scourge of violent extremism that threatens communities around the world. And there can be no peace without eliminating this scourge.

I mentioned Victoria McGrath earlier, who was injured in the Boston Marathon attack. So Boston and Northeastern need no lessons in how important it is to win the battle against terrorists. I want you to know, without exaggeration, we will win it and we are even winning it now. In Syria and Iraq, we have degraded the leadership of the terrorist group known as ISIL or Daesh, and we and our partners have liberated a third of the land that it once occupied, and we are continuing to move. They have not taken one piece of territory and held it since May of last year, but we’re not going to be successful in the long run – we’re not going to be successful in the long run if the world continues to turn away from other kinds of problems and allows the production of terrorists at such an alarming rate. And that is why it is critical that we expand our commitment to taking on violent extremism at the roots.

We know that there are millions of young people across the globe with no jobs, no opportunity, but they have smartphones in their hands. They can see what the rest of the world has. And in the seeing of that, they also see and know what they don’t have. I want you to know that the fruit vendor who ignited the Arab Spring in Tunisia – he wasn’t religiously motivated. There was no religion at all in what he did. He was tired of being slapped around by a corrupt policeman who wanted a bribe, and he was so frustrated by his inability to sell his own fruit where he wanted that he self-immolated. And that ignited a revolution that saw a dictator of 30 years driven out of the country. That’s what ignited Tahrir Square. There was no religion in Tahrir Square in terms of what motivated it. It was young people like you who wanted an opportunity like you have here, but they wanted it in their home and for their country. We need these young people to know that their countries and their communities will not be abandoned to the clutches of terrorists and extremists.

Experts tell us that a 50 percent reduction in youth unemployment could lift the global living standards by 6 percent or more. So our mission – your mission – is to create jobs not just in a few places but in many places. And that’s going to require the deep involvement jointly of the private sector, civil society, academic institutions, international organizations, and governments everywhere, and still there will be no guarantees. And let me make it clear: Doing this is not about charity. It’s not about giving something for nothing. It’s about building our own security and preventing the conflicts of the future that may inevitably see us having to become involved.

There used to be a famous song during World War I, “Over There,” sang about the distant shores where our soldiers traveled to fight. But in our time, in your time, there is no “over there;” in a digital, well-traveled world – in a global marketplace – those distant shores are practically always right at our doorstep.

So all of us need to do much more to build relationships with partners overseas, to deliver assistance to families and communities abroad, to promote stability worldwide. And we need to do this not because it is morally right, which it is; not just because it’s in keeping with our national ethos, which is also true; but because our own security and prosperity demand it.

My friends, we are blessed to live in a country with a $17 trillion economy, and yet we spend just one penny on every dollar of our federal budget on all of our foreign aid.

The fact is there is much more that we can do and must do to encourage and reward innovation, to diversify economies, to improve governance, to stop corruption, to ensure the education of young people and that it actually teaches young people what they need to know and keeps them from being radicalized.

Now, there is much more that we can invest and many more projects for my generation and yours to take on as you take on your careers in the days ahead.

Now, I ask you just for a moment to think about the careers of the three distinguished Americans who preceded me in receiving honorary degrees from this university today. Over a period of decades, Susan Hockfield dedicated her vision and her talent to the fight against brain cancer. Through a combination of genius and high purpose, Tom McCarthy has reached the pinnacle of his art, the storytelling. Charlie Bolden has been an aviator, an astronaut, a military commander, the administrator of NASA, and above all, an inspiring leader of women and men.

None of them would be here today if they were easily satisfied – and the accomplishments, which earned their degrees, came about because they dared to always explore the outermost limits of what they could do.

Thinking especially of Charlie, and my own Dad – who flew in the Army Air Corps in the year prior to Pearl Harbor – I want to tell you in closing about a group of people who called – who were called on years ago to test themselves under the most extreme conditions.

The setting was Asia; the time a few months after the start of World War II. Enemy planes dominated the traditional air routes. So to get supplies from India to friendly forces in China, American aviators had to fly hundreds of miles over some of the world’s highest mountains, including the towering Himalayas. They called it “flying the hump,” and nothing similar had ever been attempted.

The airplanes they flew came straight from the factory and were untested. The pilots were given no charts, so they drew their own. They were asked to fly higher than any aviator had flown; higher than they had been trained to fly; and they did so over the globe’s most forbidding terrain. Amid clouds or in darkness, a hidden peak or a crag could appear at any moment and bring them down. And yet, each night, plane after plane flew off into the unknown because, had they not, allied forces would have stood no chance.

Eventually, the Pentagon sent an officer to observe and talk to the pilots, deciding in each case whether the strain had become too much and the aviator should be sent home. Now, the officer reported back that some of the flyers were mentally drained after the first trip; others began to crack in a couple of weeks or months. Only a few were able to go on and on, much longer than their buddies. In four years, more than a thousand pilots were lost, but together, these courageous airmen – none of them famous or with big reputations – they kept the supply lines open and they helped to win the war.

Now, some of these pilots were better able than others to persevere, but here’s the point: none failed, because all went as far as their own capabilities allowed; each pushed – like a dedicated marathoner has to push – to plumb those final reserves of strength and find the spark of greatness within them.

That is the most that anyone could have asked of them. It’s what history demands from the United States of America. And it’s what the future asks of you.

You graduate today with an increasing reservoir of knowledge and skills – but how you use those gifts, how far you push yourselves, whether you give your own capabilities a full chance – that’s not just about education; that’s a question of character, and a question that only you can answer.

When Robert Kennedy was running for president in 1968, he raised with students at the University of Kansas some basic questions about dignity and purpose.

He pointed out that what we now call our GDP was measured, among other things, in items like the size of our military, the capacity of our jails, the production of our weapons, and the pollution emanating from our factories. It was not, he lamented, measured in the things that mattered most in our daily lives.

Kennedy said, “The gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom or our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”

My friends, we are under no illusions about the gigantic challenges before us. But we should remember that, compared to any earlier generation, we have tremendous advantages. A child today is more likely than ever before to be born healthy, more likely to be adequately fed, more likely to get the necessary vaccinations, more likely to attend school, more likely to live a long life.

Individuals and companies around the world thrive on new technologies that have made possible incredible breakthroughs in communications, education, health care, economic growth. And the number of democracies has doubled while the number of nuclear weapons has fallen by two-thirds in just the last 30 years.

And all of this isn’t because of any one country or because of what governments do alone. It’s what happens when people have faith in their own values, in their own skills; when they respect the rights and dignity of each other; and when they believe in the possibility of progress no matter how many setbacks may stand in their way.

That is not a complicated formula. But it gives me a powerful sense of confidence in what together we can achieve now and in what you can achieve in the years and the decades ahead. Because meeting those challenges, pursuing arenas that excite your passions, completing the mission to teach and serve and heal and give back – that is what makes life worthwhile.

And I encourage you to search for the greatness within while you push for the outermost horizons. And remember always as you do this what Nelson Mandela said: “All the hardest jobs seem impossible until they are done.”

Congratulations again to all of you, and thank you for letting me share this day with you.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Good morning. And congratulations!

Now I’ll try to be brief this morning. As a musician, this is about 10 hours before I normally go to work, so I’m gonna need a nap soon. And you’ve got degrees to receive.

And I also have a feeling some of you are already tired of me. The thing about pop radio in America, somehow they’ve scientifically determined that the public is only capable of liking the same 10 songs at any given time, so they simply play those songs over and over and over until you’re finally completely exasperated. Then they move on...

I’ve had a 10-year career as a solo artist and none of my songs has ever been one of those 10 songs. Until this moment. And now “all of you, are so over me, you’re tired of hearing that I went to Penn. Why’d they bring him back again?”

That was my humblebrag way of saying I have the biggest song in the country. Very artful, wouldn’t you say?

But, honestly, I am truly humbled and honored and grateful to be here at the commencement of one of the finest universities on the planet. I first visited this campus as a high school senior named John Stephens in 1995 — 19 years ago — and I would have never thought at that moment that I would be standing here as John Legend, speaking to you today.

The reason I’m here, the reason I’ve had such a wonderful journey so far, is that I’ve found love. Yes, love. We were all made to love. And I’ve found that we live our best lives, we are at our most successful, not simply because we’re smarter than everyone else, or because we hustle harder. Not because we become millionaires more quickly. The key to success, the key to happiness, is opening your mind and your heart to love. Spending your time doing things you love and with people you love.

My life could have gone differently though. At first, I had a pretty good childhood. I grew up in a small blue-collar city called Springfield, Ohio. I was surrounded by family, including 2 loving parents who cared so much about our education that they home-schooled us for several years during grade school. And they took the time to teach us more than academics. They taught us about character, about what it meant to live a good life.

My father often talked to us about his definition of success. He told us that it wasn’t measured in money and material things, but it was measured in love and joy and the lives you’re able to touch — the lives you’re able to help. And my parents walked the walk. They gave of themselves to our church. They took in foster kids and helped the homeless, even though we didn’t have much money ourselves.

Growing up in the Stephens house also meant you were immersed in art and music and encouraged to be creative. We had a piano and a drum kit in the house. I begged to take piano lessons when I was 4. I started singing in the church choir and in school plays by the time I was 7. So I fell in love with music at a very young age.

My family was like a model family in our church and local community. My parents were leaders, raising intelligent, talented kids in a loving environment. We even had a little singing group called the “Stephens 5.”

But things started to fall apart when I was 10. My maternal grandmother passed away that year when she was only 58 years old, and her death devastated my family. She was our church organist, and on Sundays after church, I would go to her house just to hang out with her. She would make chicken and collard greens and corn bread. And she would teach me how to play gospel piano. She was one of my favorite people on the planet.

She and my mother were also very close, and her death sent my mother into a deep depression that eventually tore our family apart. My world was shattered. My parents got divorced. My mother disappeared into over a decade of drugs and despair. And I was confused and disoriented.

After the initial shock of my family breaking apart, my outward response wasn’t very emotional. I coped by being stoic and seemingly unaffected. I thought if I didn’t expose myself to any more pain and vulnerability, I could never get hurt. If I didn’t fall in love, no one could ever betray me like that again.

I busied myself with school work and lots of activities, and tried not to think too much about my family situation, tried to avoid pain whenever possible. A big reason I only applied to colleges on the east coast was to make sure I had no reminders of home in my daily life.

The only thing I allowed myself to really love without reservation was music. I put all of my passion into it. I spent so much of my spare time working on it, that I barely got any sleep. At night, I was doing community choir, show choir and musicals in high school; a cappella and a church choir in college. I wrote my own songs. Played in talent shows. I put a lot of energy into becoming a better artist, a better writer and a better performer. And in some ways, it made me a better student and a better leader. Because when you actually care about something, you want to lead. Apathy’s not so cool any more.

When I graduated from Penn, I had many of the traditional opportunities in front of you now, and I took a job at the Boston Consulting Group. But I couldn’t shake my passion for music. I had followed the path that the Penn graduate was supposed to take, but I didn’t fall in love. I immediately started thinking about how I could leave BCG and become a full-time musician. I spent hours during the day preparing powerpoint presentations and financial models. And I spent almost as many hours at night writing songs and performing at small gigs around New York and Philadelphia.

I always believed that my big break would come sooner rather than later. In fact, from 1998, while I was still at Penn, to early 2004, I spent each of those years always thinking that I would get that big record deal within the next few months. I always thought my moment was just around the corner. But I was rejected by all the major labels; some of them rejected me multiple times. I played for all the giants of the business — Clive Davis, L.A. Reid, Jimmy Iovine, you name it. And all of them turned me down.

But I did find a young producer from Chicago named Kanye West who believed in me. Kanye happened to be the cousin of my good friend DeVon Harris, a classmate and roommate of mine here at Penn. DeVon introduced me to Kanye in 2001, and we’ve been working together ever since. Our collaboration has been a huge part of my career, and it had a lot to do with me finally getting a major recording contract in 2004.

Now, Kanye and I have very different personalities, as you might have guessed. But what unites us is our true love for music and art. We love to create, and at no point in our creative process do we stress about what will sell or what’s already popular. We think about making something beautiful, something special, something we can be proud of. We truly do this because we love it. We put all of ourselves into it.

And it turns out that love requires that level of commitment from you. Half-doing it is not doing it right. You have to go all in. And yes, your personal relationships require that too.

I know what it’s like to be all ego in your 20s. I know what it’s like to be selfish and just focus on your immediate wants and desires. I know what it’s like to protect your heart from pain and disappointment. I know what it means to be all about the rat race and winning.

But years from now, when you look back on your time here on earth, your life and your happiness will be way more defined by the quality of your relationships, not the quantity. You’ll get much more joy out of depth, not breadth. It’s about finding and keeping the best relationships possible with the people around you. It’s about immersing yourself in your friendships and your family. It’s about being there for the people you care about, and knowing that they’ll be there for you.

I know. It’s not easy to go all in on love. I’m 35 and I’m married and I’m still learning how to do this completely. But I’ve found someone who makes me want to try, someone who makes me want to take that risk. And it’s made all the difference.

Now, I’ve already talked about the power of love in your work and your personal lives. But I also want to talk about how love changes the world. There are 7 billion other people out there. 7 billion strangers. I want you to consider what it means to love them too. What does it mean to love people we don’t know, to see the value in every single person’s life?

Think about that. It’s a pretty radical notion. It means your daughter or son, your neighbor’s daughter or son and the daughters and sons of people who live thousands of miles away, all deserve the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It means we let go of fear and see each other’s humanity. It means we don’t see Trayvon Martin as a walking stereotype, a weaponized human. We see him as a boy who deserves the chance to grow into a man, even if he makes boyish mistakes along the way. It means American lives don’t count more than Iraqi lives. It means we see a young Palestinian kid not as a future security threat or demographic challenge, but as a future father, mother and lover. It means that the nearly 300 kidnapped girls in Nigeria aren’t just their problem. They’re “our” girls too. It’s actually quite a challenge to love humankind in this way.

Professor Cornel West gives us a word for what this kind of love looks like in public. That word is justice.

If you’re committed to loving in public, it requires you opening your eyes to injustice, to see the world through the eyes of another. This is not a passive activity. You have to read. You have to travel to other neighborhoods, other parts of the world. You may have to get your hands dirty. You have to allow people to love you, and you have to love them back

My team and I met a young girl named Rose from a small, impoverished village in Ghana. When you’re working with development organizations and visiting the communities they work in, you’re not really supposed to single out one child to fall in love with. You’re supposed to stick to the program and focus on the interventions that lift the community as a whole. But we couldn’t help it. We fell in love with Rose. Something about the spark in her eyes and her indomitable spirit made us want to go the extra mile to help her. So we decided to use our own funds to sponsor her tuition to secondary school.

We’ve stayed in touch with her over the past 7 years, and we’re so proud of what she’s done individually. But we’re also happy that she inspired us to formalize and expand our scholarship program to many girls in communities like hers throughout Africa, communities where the parents often invest in the boys’ secondary education, but don’t do the same for the girls.

In my travels around the world, I’ve looked in the eyes of many young girls and boys from Africa to Southeast Asia to Harlem, kids who had big dreams and needed someone to believe in them and invest in their future, in their education.

What would our schools look like if we were committed to love in public? If we cared about every kid in our school system, we would make sure they didn’t go to school hungry. We would make sure they had proper health care and counseling. We would make sure they had excellent teachers in every classroom. We would make sure we weren’t unfairly suspending them and criminalizing them for minor behavioral problems. We’d make sure all of them had the resources they need.

Every religion has this idea of philanthropy, love for mankind, at its core. But you shouldn’t do this just to make sure you get into the “pearly gates.” Look at the work of Marty Seligman here at Penn, who has literally written the book on happiness. Look at the work of Adam Grant, whom I hear is the most highly rated professor here: He has the data to show that giving works. There’s an increasing body of research and knowledge that tells us that living a life of love and compassion is the true path to success and contentment.

So what’s going to stop you? What’s going to stand in your way? What’s going to keep you from achieving your success? What will prevent you from going all in on love?

We’re taught when we’re young that the opposite of love is hate. But it’s not. Hate is a byproduct. Hate is a result. Being a hater isn’t cool. Nobody wants that. But hate comes from one thing: fear. And fear is the opposite of love. It’s not a coincidence that when we talk about bigotry, we often talk in terms of fear: homophobia, xenophobia. Fear is what blinds us. Fear is corrosive. Fear makes us hold back. It whispers to us, tells us that we’ll fail. It tells us that our differences are too much to overcome. Fear locks us in place. It starts fights. It causes wars.

And fear keeps us from loving. Even though we’re made to love, we’re often afraid to love. We’re afraid of being hurt deeply. Afraid of feeling the pain I went through when my parents divorced. But you’re never going to really love something or someone unless you put those fears aside. Don’t hold back. Being in love means being ready to give freely and openly, and being ready to risk something. Risking pain and disappointment, conquering your fears, and becoming anew.

Alice Walker once said, “The more I wonder, the more I love.” Love calls you to open your eyes, to seek, to search, to wonder.

Love is all-consuming — it infiltrates your body, it’s what allows you to experience bliss, joy and true friendship. You’ll be more disappointed when something goes wrong. You might fall harder. But the only way you’ll reach any height in life and in love is by taking the chance that you might fall.

You have to give your all.

Yes, I’ve been not-so-subtly working in my song lyrics. And some might think it’s all a bit too much. Here I am, this R&B singer with an album called Love in the Future, who’s recently married and wrote the biggest love song of the year, and what did I choose to talk about? Love. It’s so corny, isn’t it. It’s much cooler to be detached and apathetic, right? We all like a little snark and cynicism and irony, especially from our favorite artists and comedians and writers. I get it.

But that cool detachment only gets you so far. Passion gets you a lot further. It makes you a better entrepreneur, a better leader, a better philanthropist, a better friend, a better lover.

I want you to live the best life you can. You can be world-changers. When you leave here today, you’re going to be looking for a lot of things: security, money, friendships, sex, all kinds of things. But the most important thing you’ll find is love.

So love your self, love your work, love the people around you. Dare to love those who are different from you, no matter where they’re from, what they look like, and who they love. Pursue this life of love with focus and passion and ambition and courage. Give it your all. And that will be your path to true success.

Congratulations to the Class of 2014 and thank you so much!

Thank you. President Coleman… members of the Board of Regents… distinguished faculty and administration… honored guests… parents, families, and friends… and most importantly, members of the class of 2014!

Thank you for having me here this morning. I am honored to be a part of today’s commencement exercises.

President Coleman – on the eve of your retirement, I would like to thank you for the tremendous contributions you have made to the University, to Ann Arbor, and to the state of Michigan.

In 12 years, you have more than doubled the University’s foundation… overseen the launch of 49 new degree programs… and literally helped change the skyline of this city.

I know I speak for many when I say congratulations and thank you for everything you have done.

As I thought about what I wanted to say today, I thought back to when I was a student myself.

I recall very well the joy of graduation. And I recall the promise and excitement I felt about leaving school and starting my career in earnest.

The world has changed significantly since then. Fast forward to today and you, as members of the Class of 2014, are also members of the “Millennial Generation.”

Demographers like to talk about you as if you were a monolithic mass of humanity. Well, I have two teenagers at home – one just a year away from starting college himself. So, despite the fact that your generation is 80 million strong – making you the largest age grouping in American history – I’m well aware that no two Millennials are exactly alike.

For example, not all of you are attached to your cell phones 24/7. About one in five of you actually manages to sleep without it.

And not all of you grew up with high-speed Internet. Apparently, some of your parents still have dial-up.

And this may come as a shock, but not all of you are millionaires. Not yet! But you are the richest generation in history, with collective spending power and influence of almost 1 trillion dollars.

Not all of you have short attention spans.

Let me repeat that. Not all of you have short attention spans. In fact, some of you haven’t sent a text or tweet in the entire three minutes I’ve been speaking.

Not all of you speak “acronym.” HBU IDK FTW.

For the parents in the audience, that’s “How About You?… I Don’t Know… For the Win!”

In fact, some of you still use your cell phones to make actual phone calls. OMG!

Finally, not all of you believe you will be famous. But thanks to Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, some of you already are.

Of course, not everything has changed since I was a student.

The skills you have learned here at Michigan – critical thinking, problem solving, communication, analysis, teamwork – they are just as essential for success today as they were 30 years ago.

But as I’m sure you know very well, these skills are just the start of what you need for success in today’s challenging world. They are the price of admission to today’s fast-paced, ever-changing, increasingly global economy.

To stand out… to really make a difference… you will also need the kind of skills and qualities that most of us learn from experience and over time. Allow me to offer you half a dozen lessons that I have learned since my graduation… lessons that have been important to me… and hopefully will be to you.

One, no matter what you choose to do in life, pursue it with passion and hard work.

In my experience… in school and career, at work and at play… there are lots of very talented people out there. But talent alone is not enough.

You need something more. One thing that distinguishes those who really make a difference in life, those who really contribute, is passion and hard work.

Remember: hard work beats talent… if talent doesn’t work hard.

So, don’t be content to work around the edges of your profession. Don’t wait to be invited to important meetings, or asked to work on critical assignments.

Instead, do whatever it takes to ensure that you work in the middle of your business. Speak up. Volunteer. Show your enthusiasm. Knock on doors.

As an employee, your enthusiasm will make your job more interesting, and also get you noticed. And as a manager, your passion will inspire others to join your team and work as hard as you to accomplish big things.

Two, conduct yourself with integrity at all times.

In every aspect of your life, be honest. Be fair. Keep your promises. Do what you know to be right – for your customers, your patients, your clients, your co-workers, your employees, your family, your friends, yourself.

Remember that how you get things done is just as important as getting them done.

And remember that your integrity is priceless when unquestioned… but worthless, or worse, when it isn’t.

Your integrity is one of the most valuable possessions you have. Protect it. Cultivate it. Wear it with pride. This is a lesson that the University of Michigan has taught for nearly 200 years. It is one we do well to remember every day.

Three, build relationships.

Everything we know about the Class of 2014 tells us you are one of the most talented and accomplished classes in school history. I have no doubt that many of you will go on to do great things. But remember that no one does great things alone.

Success is always a team effort. And as tomorrow’s team leaders, you must earn the respect and trust of the people you lead. That means being open, seeking solutions, and often listening more than talking. Because people don’t care what you know until they know that you care.

To quote Bo Schembechler: “If you do not like people, you will not take the time to get to know them, and if you don’t get to know them, you will have no idea what scares them, what inspires them, what motivates them.”

Remember, too, that you can’t build a relationship only when you need it. Like so many important things in life, strong relationships are built gradually, steadily, over time. And there’s no better time to start than now.

Four, address challenges head on.

I’m reminded of the plant manager who asked his lead engineer to explain her hiring process.

She said, “We fill a bathtub with water and offer the applicant a teaspoon, a teacup, and a bucket. Then we ask him or her to empty the tub.”

“I get it,” the manager said. “A go-getter will use the bucket.”

“No,” said the engineer. “A go-getter will pull the drain plug.”

If you have an issue in your life – at work or at home – pull the drain plug! Address it head on, with everything you have, and address it right away.

In my experience, it is much better to get the right people together, to make a plan, and to address every challenge head on.

Remember that hope is not a strategy. And problems don’t go away when you ignore them – they get bigger.

Five, give something back.

As tomorrow’s leaders, you have a great opportunity to use your knowledge and passion to build fulfilling lives for yourselves. But do more than that. Use your talents to help build better lives for others, as well.

I imagine we have a few “Spiderman” fans among the graduates today?

Remember that “with great power comes great responsibility.” Never underestimate the effect that you can have on others… in actions large and small.

I noted earlier how the Millennial Generation is the largest, richest, most technological generation in American history. What I didn’t say is that you’re also the most inclusive and probably the most optimistic.

Use these traits… along with the unprecedented access to information and global communication that we have today… to challenge convention.

More than any generation in history, you have the power to expose and correct injustice, to rethink outdated assumptions, and to make a difference.

And remember that while there’s certainly a lot wrong in the world today, there’s also a lot right, too. Not everything needs changing. Some things need protecting – and that can be just as important, challenging, and rewarding as changing the world.

I hope that each you will find something that you feel strongly about supporting… and that you will make it an important part of your life. In that way, you truly can make the world a better place.

Finally, the last thing I want to mention on this special day is to remember your friends, family, and faith.

Keep your friends and family close. I just can’t tell you how important they are. They make your life journey truly rewarding. During the good times, you’ll have someone to celebrate with… like today. And during the tough times, you’ll have someone to turn to for advice, comfort, and love.

Remember that this day is almost as important for your parents and loved ones as it is for you. As a mom, I can say it might even be more important!

Be sure to thank them… and tell them how much their support and sacrifice has meant to you.

And remember your faith, whatever it may be.

Faith doesn’t make things easy… but it can make things possible.

So, a lot has changed in the 29 years since I sat in your chair. And a lot has stayed the same.

It may feel like your life is mapped out for you today, but I can assure you – things will happen that you simply cannot imagine today.

Be open to opportunities when they occur – especially in the early part of your career. Each new experience will broaden your skills and perspectives. Embrace them. Enjoy them. And overcome them. They are the experiences that will make you unique… the milestones that define your life.

Again, my sincere thanks for the opportunity to speak to you today.

Most of all, congratulations to each of this year’s graduates.

This is your life… and I am so excited for each and every one of you!

Thank you.


Oh, my goodness! Good morning!

I am so happy to be here with you all. I'm proud to be here in the Big Easy. Look at you all! You look good.

Thank you. I want to start by thanking Nicole for that very kind introduction and for sharing her story, which is not too unfamiliar to me -- because they told me I couldn't be where I am, too. So I want to thank Nicole. I'm proud of her. Thank you for the selfie; I think that's the first selfie I've done at a commencement. So, Nicole, you're my first.

And of course, I want to thank the Dillard University Choir. Oh, oh, oh! Oh! That's all I can say. It's like you want to start something up in here, right? It's like, now we got a commencement going on up in here. That was beautiful, beautiful. Thank you so much.

I also want to recognize Senator Mary Landrieu, who is here. Let's give her a hand. She has been a strong supporter of this university.

I want to thank the Dillard University Board of Trustees. I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and, of course, your tremendous president, Dr. Walter Kimbrough. Now, my husband has been called a few things over the years, but he has never had the honor of being referred to as the “Hip Hop President.”

I also want to thank all the folks from the University of New Orleans for hosting us here today. And I know they're hosting the folks at Southern University at New Orleans for their commencement later on today as well, so we wish them a wonderful day. And thank you for having us.

And of course, I've got to give a big shout-out to all the family members in the crowd, all of the family members -- especially to the mothers, because it is the day before Mother's Day. To all the mothers, Happy Mother's Day.

Now, graduates, you all handled your business, right? Just because you were graduating didn't mean you -- come on, now. Okay, well, if you didn't, you have my permission to get up and go right now, because there is nothing more important -- no, no, don't get up. Your mothers would kill you if you got up at this moment. So just stay in your seats, and when this is all over make sure you take care of mom.

But in all seriousness, to all the moms out there -- as well as the dads and the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts, the brothers, the sisters, all of you who have helped raise these graduates -- you have seen them through their ups and downs, and you have poured your hearts and souls into these men and women. So today is your day, too, and you should be very proud. You really should.

And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the beautiful and handsome men and women of the Dillard University Class of 2014. Yay! You all have come so far, I know, to make it to this day -- from all those early days when the girls were sneaking out of Williams Hall to go see the boys over at the Duals -- oh yeah, I did my research -- to all those tests you crammed for, to the plans you're making now for your careers, to go on to graduate school.

You all have seen so much. You've witnessed this school's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- the new buildings that replaced the ones you lost, the classrooms that started filling back up again, the service projects that you all have done to help this community bounce back. And I know along the way that each of you has written your own story of resilience and determination to make it here to this day.

For example, as you heard, Nicole was told back in high school that she just wasn't college material. But now she is your class president, and she's headed off to Yale for her graduate degree. So there. That's it.

And I know that some of you may come from tough neighborhoods; some of you may have lost your homes during Katrina. Maybe you're like DeShawn Dabney, a graduate who was raised by his grandmother -- maybe -- that's your grandmother, isn't it, DeShawn? Raised by his grandmother while some of his family members were dealing with issues. Maybe just like him, you've been working part-time jobs since you were a teenager to make your dream of going to college come true. And now, today, you're all here ready to walk across this stage and get that diploma.

And no matter what path you took to get here, you all kept your hearts set on this day. You fought through every challenge you encountered, and you earned that degree from this fine university. And in doing so, you are following in the footsteps of all those who came before you, and you have become an indelible part of the history of this school -- a history that, as you all know, stretches back to well before the Civil War, back to 1826, the year a child named Emperor Williams was born.

Now, Emperor was born into slavery. But as he grew up, he managed to teach himself to read and write well enough to create a pass that allowed him to come and go around the city without getting hassled. But one day, his master saw the pass and he said, where did you learn to write like that? Now, just imagine the fear Emperor must have felt when he heard that question -- because remember, back then it was illegal for a slave to learn to read or write. So who knows what kind of punishment he may have gotten -- a beating, a whipping, even worse.

We don't exactly know what happened on that day, but we do know that when Emperor turned 32, after more than three decades in bondage, he became a free man. He decided to stay in New Orleans, and he went on to become a minister -- even founded a church right here in town. And in 1869, when abolitionists, missionaries, black folks and white folks came together to create a school for freed slaves here in New Orleans, Emperor was one of the original signers of the charter.

They decided to name the school New Orleans University, because even though most of the classes would be taught at a high school level or below, oh, their aspirations were much higher than that. And when they laid the cornerstone for that university's first building down on St. Charles Avenue, Emperor got a chance to speak.

He said -- and these are his words -- he said, “For twenty years I was a slave on these streets. It was a penitentiary offense to educate a Negro. I have seen my fellow-servants whipped for trying to learn; but today here am I, speaking where a building is to be erected for the education of the children of my people.” He goes on to say, “I wonder if this is the world I was born in.”

See, in the course of his short lifetime, Emperor saw education go from being a crime for black folks to being a real possibility for his kids and grandkids. So no wonder he was asking whether this was the same world he'd been born into. See, for a man like Emperor, getting an education could open up a whole new world of opportunity. An education meant having real power. It meant you could manage your own money. It meant you couldn't get swindled out of land or possessions when somebody told you to just sign on the dotted line; sometimes even determined whether or not you could vote.

So most folks back then saw education as the key to real and lasting freedom. That's why, when New Orleans University and the other African American college in town, Straight University, first opened their doors, one of the biggest problems they faced was too many students. That's right -- too many students. Many of these students barely spoke English; they'd grown up speaking Creole or French. Few had ever seen the inside of a classroom or even been taught their ABCs.

But let me tell you, those students were hungry -- you hear me? Hungry. They studied like their lives depended on it. They blazed through their lessons. And that hunger for education lasted for generations in the African American community here in New Orleans.

When an arsonist set fire to the school's library in 1877, they built a new one. When those two original schools ran into financial troubles years later, they started making plans to build an even bigger and better university. And in the 1930s, when white folks complained that this new school would mean too many black students on their buses, the folks at the school got the city to add a bus line just for their students, because nothing -- nothing -- was going to stop them from achieving the vision of those early founders.

And finally, in May of 1934, they broke ground for this school, Dillard University -- a university that would go on to produce some of the leading thinkers and achievers in our country. And the day the cornerstone was laid for your library, the President of Howard University spoke these words: He said, “There lies in this Southland today, buried in unmarked graves, many a black genius who would have blessed this city and this section of our country, if only his parents could have had before them the Dillard University you are now building.”

And in the years since then, through segregation and depression, through threats of violence and the floodwaters of a devastating storm, students like you have come here to study and to learn, and to carry forward those hopes and dreams. And today, I stand before a sea of young geniuses. Oh, yeah.

So, graduates, I hope that you understand that this day is not just the culmination of your own dreams, but the realization of the dreams of so many who came before you. And you should be so proud, and so happy, and so excited about your futures. But what you shouldn't be is satisfied. See, because while it is a wonderful thing that all of you are here today, we have to ask ourselves, what about all those geniuses who never get this chance?

I'm talking about the young people from right here in New Orleans and across the country who aren't part of a commencement like this one today, kids no different from all of us, kids who never made it out of high school. The fact is that today, the high school graduation rate for black students is improving, but it is still lower than just about any other group in this country. And while college graduation rates have risen for nearly every other demographic, including African American women, the college graduation rate for African American men has flatlined.

See, and the thing is, when our young people fall behind like that in school, they fall behind in life. Last year, African Americans were more than twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. They were almost three times as likely to live in poverty. And they were far more likely to end up in prison or be the victims of violent crimes.

Now, perhaps when you hear these statistics, you might think to yourself, well, those numbers are terrible, but I'm not part of the problem. And you might be thinking that since you're not one of those statistics, and you're sitting here wearing that nice black robe today, you can go on your way and never look back.

But folks like you and me, we can't afford to think like that -- never. See, because we're the lucky ones, and we can never forget that we didn't get where we are today all on our own. We got here today because of so many people who toiled and sweat and bled and died for us -- people like our parents and grandparents and all those who came before them, people who never dreamed of getting a college education themselves but who worked, and saved, and sacrificed so that we could be here today. We owe them. We owe them.

And the only way to pay back that debt is by making those same kinds of sacrifices and investments for the next generation. And I know sitting here right now, that task could seem a bit overwhelming. I know it could seem like the deck is stacked way too high against our young people. And the truth is that some of the problems we face -- structural inequality, schools that lag behind, workplace and housing discrimination -- those problems are too big for one person to fix on their own.

But that's still no excuse to stand on the sidelines. Because we know that today, education is still the key to real and lasting freedom -- it is still true today. So it is now up to us to cultivate that hunger for education in our own lives and in those around us. And we know that hunger is still out there -- we know it.

We see it in students like DeShawn and Nicole and all of you who scraped and clawed so you could make it to this day. We see it in the single moms who work three jobs so their kids might have a shot at earning a degree like yours. We see that hunger all around the world -- in that young woman named Malala who was shot on her school bus in Pakistan just for speaking out in support of girls getting an education, and the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their own school in Nigeria for wanting an education -- young people who are knowingly risking their lives every day just to go to school.

And in fact, you've seen that hunger right here at Dillard: your valedictorian, three salutatorians are all from Nigeria. They studied hard at an early age, earned scholarships to come here to this university, achieved 4.0 GPAs. And now they are off pursuing master's degrees, work in software development, teaching math and science to young people here in the United States.

See, now, that's the kind of hunger for education that we have to reignite in all of our communities. It's the same hunger that gave life to this university, the same hunger that defined so many of our parents and grandparents -- including my own. You see, my parents never went to college, but they were determined to see me and my brother and all the kids in our neighborhood get a good education.

So my mother volunteered at my school -- helping out every day in the front office, making sure our teachers were doing their jobs, holding their feet to the fire if she thought they were falling short. I'd walk by the office and there she'd be. I'd leave class to go to the bathroom, there she'd be again, roaming the halls, looking in the classrooms. And of course, as a kid, I have to say, that was a bit mortifying, having your mother at school all the time.

But looking back, I have no doubt that my classmates and I got a better education because she was looking over those teachers' shoulders. You see, my mom was not a teacher or a principal or a school board member. But when it came to education, she had that hunger. So she believed that our education was very much her business.

And we need more people who think and act like my mother, and all those mothers out there, because the education of our young people is all of our business. That's what Emperor Williams thought. That's what the folks here in New Orleans thought as they worked to rebuild this campus after Katrina. And as graduates of Dillard University, that's how we need you to think every single day for the rest of your lives.

You all have opportunities and skills and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education.

And you can start small. Start by volunteering at an after-school program, or helping some high school kids fill out their college applications. Show them the path that you took. Or you can think a little bigger -- you can get your entire congregation or your community to start a mentoring program; maybe convince your new employer to sponsor scholarships for underprivileged kids. Or maybe you could think a little higher -- maybe you could run for school board or Congress, or, yes, even President of the United States.

And then maybe you could build preschools for every single one of our kids. Maybe you could help turn that pipeline to prison into a highway to college; help give every child in America an education that is truly worth of their promise. Those are the kind of big dreams that folks who founded this university reached for. That is how high they set their bar.

And so we owe it to those folks -- the folks who had the audacity to call their little schools “universities” and name their baby boys “Emperor” -- we owe it to them to reach as high as they did, and to bring others along the way. As the history of this school has taught us, no dream is too big, no vision is too bold; as long as we stay hungry for education and let that hunger be our North Star, there is nothing, graduates, nothing that we cannot achieve.

So, graduates, that is your mission. This is your obligation. I want you to keep reaching higher. I want you all to keep raising your bars. Let the next generation know that there is no greater investment than a good education. And if you do all of this, then I am confident that you will uphold that duty and write your own chapter into the legacy of this great university. And let me tell you something, I cannot wait to see the world that your children will be born into.

Congratulations. I love you all. I am honored to be here. I am proud of you. God bless you. And thank your families.

Graduates, parents, faculty, this is really such a remarkable day—obviously for you, but also for me, because after spending a life obsessing over true crime, the impossible happened: I was asked to speak at the Harvard Law commencement and accept an honorary legal degree. Yes, isn’t that the American dream? Me, Mindy Kaling—

OK, um, so apparently there was a little miscommunication. I am no longer Mindy Kaling, esquire-attorney-at-law-comedian-actress. That’s cool, I’m just supposed to stand up here and give funny remarks, and then I’m supposed to sit down… That doesn’t seem fair, but that’s OK, I’ll do that.

I know what you’re probably thinking: Mindy Kaling, why did they ask her? She’s just a pretty Hollywood starlet. What does that quadruple threat know about the law?

Sure, she seems really down to earth and pretty in a totally accessible way. And, yeah, she was on People magazine’s Most Beautiful People list this year—and also in 2008—but what intelligent remarks could she possibly make about the law? She’s probably too busy doing shampoo commercials.

But I’m not too busy. In fact, I would kill to do a shampoo commercial. So if anyone from L’Oreal is out there, please just Snapchat me after this.

But, I'll have you know, I do know a ton about the law because I sue everyone. And excuse me, there is a burger named after me at Bartley's and they have guaranteed me that it is going to be there until another tertiary member of the cast of the office get their own tv show. And they don't just name burgers after anyone. Noted chef Guy Fieri has one, noted drunk driver Justin Bieber has one, ok, so that's pretty good company, thank you.

Look, on the surface, I get that it would appear that I am an unconventional choice to speak here today. To be honest, I don't know much about the law.

I graduated in 2001 from Dartmouth College, an academic institution located in lawless rural New Hampshire, where when you arrive, you are given a flask of moonshine and a box of fireworks, and you are told simply to, quote, “Go to town”—except there is no town, there is only a forest and a row of frat houses that smell like urine.

Actually, little known fact, Dartmouth has a law school—it’s just one semester, and its coursework is entirely centered on how to beat a DUI.

But I am not here to extoll the virtues of the Dartmouth Red Bull School of Law. I'm here to talk to you. So, even though I have no idea why I was asked to speak here today, I prepared a speech very carefully the way that any good Dartmouth-educated graduate would. I drank a 40 of Jagermeister. I called my dad to see if he would get me out of it—he could not… I tried to hire a college freshman to write it for me in exchange for a $200 gift card to Newbury Comics—that didn’t work out.

Finally, seeing that I absolutely had to do this and could not get out of it, I rolled up my sleeves, sat down at my computer, and tried to buy a commencement address off of movingcommencementspeeches.com. My credit card was declined.

There are many many distinguished speakers who has spoken here. I am sharing a stage with Preet Bharara. We've all heard what a great guy he is. In 2012, he was named by Time Magazine as one of the 101 most influential people in the world. Which apparently, they're just giving out.

According to Time, Bharara has battled terrorism, as evidenced by the conviction of the Times Square bomber. He has crippled international arms dealers, drug traffickers, and dealt with financial fraud. Clearly, Harvard wanted you to see the full range of what India can produce here.

Mr. Bharara fights finance criminals and terrorism. I meet handsome men in cute and unusual ways on television. And next season my character might get a pet puppy!

So, is one more important than the other? Who can say.

This group before me is bristling with ambitious young people, many of whom have already started charities and philanthropic organizations.

With this diploma in hand, most of you will go on to the noblest of pursuits, like helping a cable company acquire a telecom company.

You will defend BP from birds.

You will spend hours arguing that the well water was contaminated well before the fracking occurred.

One of you will sort out the details of my prenup.

A dozen of you will help me with my acrimonious divorce.

And one of you will fall in love in the process—I’m talkin’ to you, Noah Feldman.

And let’s be honest, Harvard Law is the best of the Harvard graduate programs, ok, I can say this, we're amongst friends. The Business School is full of crooks, the Divinity School is just a bunch of weird virgins, the School of Design is like European burnouts, and don’t even get me started on the Kennedy School. What kind of degree do you get from there, Public Policy? You mean a Masters in Boring Me to Death at a Dinner Party, I'm sorry. The med school is just a bunch of nerdy Indians—I can say that! Preet can say that. The rest of you, you are out of line—that is racial, how dare you.

But I digress, again. I'm just really excited to be here. I am obsessed with justice. Actually, in my mind, law is that pesky thing that often gets in the way of justice. I believe in the Clint Eastwood School of the Law. An eye for an eye? I don’t think so. That solves nothing. You take my eye, I take your life, my friend, in a duel, Aaron Burr-style. I don't want your stupid eye, for what? My eye collection? You're dead.

Duels are the first thing you learn when you enter my graduate program, the Harvard School of Vengeance.

But again, that's not what I came here to talk about. The Harvard Law School crest has the word “Veritas”, which means truth in Latin. I know that because it's too boring to make up.

And if you look at the crest, you'll notice under this hallowed word, there are three bunches of asparagus. Because asparagus is the tallest and the proudest of the vegetables, the pillar of the vegetable kingdom, and it’s like, it’s like, OK, that is not asparagus, that is wheat, which makes also not a ton of sense either. OK, that was three pages of my speech, that's a callback to asparagus. I'm going to move past trying to make sense of your crest which makes no sense.

Harvard Law has an incredible number of illustrious alumni.

President Barack Obama attended Harvard Law—OR SO HE SAYS!

Elle Woods went here, from the trenchant documentary Legally Blonde. It’s a very moving film. Dean Minow, you should check it out after you read my book.

Six of the nine Supreme Court justices are graduates of Harvard Law, the other three—I don’t know where they went, I think it was University of Phoenix, not sure.

No, no, no—as we all know, they attended your friendly rival, Yale Law School.

Ok, let's just take a moment to talk about this rivalry. I know that you have a chip on your shoulder. Yale Law is always number one, and you are always number two. Sometimes Stanford comes in there, bumps you down to number three, but listen, let me tell you something—from where I stand, from an outsider’s perspective, here’s the truth: you are ALL nerds.

Except here’s the difference: you are the nerds who are going to make some serious bank, which is why I’m here today—to marry the best-looking amongst you.

Back to this beautiful diploma, it's not just a law degree, you can do whatever you want now, and this institution will follow you everywhere.

If you kill someone, you are the “Harvard Law Murderer.”

If you are caught in a lewd act in a public restroom, you’re the “Harvard Law Pervert,” my friend. And then you can represent yourself, and you’ll probably get acquitted because you went to Harvard.

In fact, the only downside of this degree is when you run for Senate, you will have to distance yourself from it to seem more like a regular person. You'll tuck in your flannel shirt into your freshly pressed jeans (that you just bought). And still, this institution is going to haunt you. No matter how many diners you eat at. No matter how many guitar solos you do with Rascal Flats, you are Harvard to the grave. You won't be able to buy enough rusty pick up truck enough to distance yourself from this place. Mitt Romney? He preferred to be known as “The Mormon Guy” to distract himself from his Harvard past.

Now I'd like to get a little serious. I am an American of Indian origin whose parents were raised in India, met in Africa, and move to America, and now I am the star and creator of my own network television program. The continents traveled, the languages mastered, the standardized tests taken over and over again, and the cultures navigated are amazing even to me. My family's dream about a future unfettered by limitations dependent only on "what you know" and not by "who you know" was possible only in America. Their romance with this country is more romantic than any romantic comedy I could ever write.

And it's all because they believed, as I do, about the concept of the inherent fairness that is alive in America. And that here, you could aspire and succeed. And that, my parents believed, their children could aspire and succeed to levels that could not have happened anywhere else in the world.

And that fairness that my parents and I take for granted, that many Americans take for granted, is in many ways resting on your shoulders to uphold. You represent those who will make laws and affect change. And that is truly an amazing thing. And more than any other group graduating today from Harvard, the laws that you write in the next five to ten years will affect this country in a fundamental way.

And now, the part of my speech where I am supposed to give you advice. And I thought, what advice could I give you guys? Celebrities give too much advice and people listen to it too much. In Hollywood, we all think we are these wise advice givers and most of us have no education whatsoever. Actors can become governors, pundits, or even high ranking officials in religions made up sixty years ago.

Well then, who should be giving advice and the answer is people like you. You are better educated and you are going to go out into the world and people are going to listen to what you say, whether you are good or evil, and that probably scares you because some of you look really young. And I’m afraid a couple of you probably are evil. That’s just the odds.

And to be honest, it scares me because you look like a bunch of tweens. So please, just try to be the kind of people that give advice to celebrities, not the other way around. You are entering a profession where, no matter how bad the crime or the criminal, you have to defend the alleged perpetrator. Across the campus, Harvard Business School graduates are receiving diplomas, and you will need to defend them—for insider trading or narcotics, or maybe both if Wolf of Wall Street is to be believed.

The thing I find the most fascinating, is that you are responsible for the language of justice, for the careful and precise wording in all those boring contracts that I sign while I watch Real Housewives.

You wrote the Terms and Conditions that I scroll through quickly while I download the update for Candy Crush. Terms and Conditions are the only things keeping us from the purge, everybody. I don’t read them—I just hit Accept. iTunes may own my ovaries for all I know.

“Employees must wash their hands before returning to work.” A lawyer wrote that.

“You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.” A lawyer wrote that.

“Mindy Kaling may not come within 1,000 feet of Professor Noah Feldman.” A lawyer wrote that.

These are protections that we take for granted. Your dedication to meticulous reading is a tedium that I find so admirable. You take words and you turn them into the infrastructure that keeps our world stable.

The seductive southern lawyers from John Grisham novels get all the glory, the Noah Feldmans, but the rest of you form the foundation for our day to day lives. It's backbreaking and often, there is not much glory. And in that way, a lot of you will become the quiet heros of our country. And those of you that go on to work for big pharma and Phillip Morris, you will become the loud anti-heros and someone is certain to make an AMC series glamorizing you.

Either way, you can't go wrong. I look at you and see our nation's future. Attorneys, corporate lawyers, public prosecutors, judges, politicians, maybe even the President of the United States. Those are all positions of such great influence. Understand that one day you will have the power to make a difference.

So use it well. Thank you graduates, thank you faculty, thank you parents, thank you movinggraduationspeeches.com.

Congratulations.

Chancellor Hyman and the Board of Trustees, distinguished members of the City Colleges faculty and staff, delighted family members, devoted friends, antsy siblings, welcome to you all ... and congratulations to the magnificent City Colleges Class of 2014! 

It is truly a privilege for me to be asked to join you all today in honoring nearly 2,000 graduates from seven great schools across Chicago, studying in colleges named for giants who dared to imagine a better city, a better country, a better world — Dr. King and Harold Washington — and for those who dedicated their lives to serving their country like Milton Olive and Carmel Harvey.Graduating is a remarkable achievement. I hope that each of you feels truly proud to have reached this milestone. I can tell you, as a mother myself, that pride you feel goes double for your family. Seriously, their hearts are bursting right now. So let your family hug you for as long as they want after this ceremony. Trust me, they will look back at photos and think, “That was one of the happiest days of my life.” And you will look back on the same photos and think, “Did I really wear my hair like that?”

Today, many of you become the first person in your family to earn a higher degree. I want to take a special moment to celebrate this achievement. To your families — and to me — you are heroes. Grandmothers and single moms, sons who supported their families while in school, students who worked by day and hit the books at night. You learned to write code, build a robot, heal the sick, even bake a fluffier pastry.

You invested not just money, but a lot of time and a lot of sweat. But it was worth it. With these skills, you and your fellow graduates are more likely to get a better first job. Better jobs in the future. Not only higher incomes but higher expectations for a better life because you studied so hard and sacrificed so much.

I know this because education lifted my family, too. My great grandparents emigrated to this country and struggled to make their way and make ends meet with the goal that their children would have a better life. That happened when their children — my grandfather and his siblings — were able to attend college. My grandfather graduated from City College in New York, which put my father and then, in turn, me on a different path. Many of you are setting your families on that path today — and I know everyone here joins me in applauding your great accomplishment.As I thought about what I wanted to say here, I reflected on the many graduation speeches I have heard. The best speeches had two qualities: They were relevant ... and they were brief. I will try to be both. As a side note, of course I encourage you to use Facebook as much as possible, but please refrain from posting any “Sheryl Sandberg is boring” comments — at least until I am done.

For some, this marks the end of your time in school as you head into the workforce. Others will continue, seeking more education. Before you turn to face these and other challenges, I want you to reflect on your time at City Colleges. Because in addition to everything you learned in your courses, I hope you also learned this — dreams can come true. With hard work, sacrifices and perseverance, you can turn your dreams into reality. Your proof is that you’re standing here now.

So I want to use my brief time to urge you to stay ambitious, keep reaching, keep dreaming. Don’t lean back ... lean in. The fact that you made this dream come true means you should be more ambitious. This is only a start. Dream bigger — both for yourself and the world around you. As you extend your reach, you will see that what once seemed unattainable is now within your grasp. I want you to see that nothing is impossible. I want you to know that your dream is the possible dream.

So the question becomes: How do you get there? Each path is unique, but there are three things that we all must do to achieve our full potential.First and most important: Believe in yourself.

Believing you can do something is the first step to doing it. I know first-hand that self-confidence comes more naturally for some than for others.  When my brother and I were both in high school, one day we both had dates — yes, I know, I’m so old that back then we scheduled dates and didn’t just text people, “U up?” It turned out that both our dates canceled on us at the last minute. I spent the rest of the weekend moping around the house, worrying about all the things that were wrong with me that made the guy blow me off. My brother decided the girl had “missed out on a great thing” and went off to play basketball with his friends.

Four years later, my brother and I took a class together in college. I was a senior, he was a sophomore. I went to all of the lectures and read all of the books. He went to a few lectures and read two books. After we sat for our exams, he was sure he had aced it, but I was sure I had failed — despite knowing far more than he did. 

I joke with my brother to this day that I want to spend a few minutes as him — it must feel oh-so good. But in reality, even he has moments where he doubts himself. We all do.Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post, says that we all have an obnoxious roommate in our heads — telling us we can’t do something, that the question we want to ask is dumb, that our idea will never work, or even that we are having a truly awful hair day. That obnoxious roommate, that self-doubt, holds us back. 

Over my many years in school and the workforce, I have seen so many people hold themselves back. I see people sit on the side of the room instead of sitting at the table. I see people sit in the back rather than at the front. I see people lower their hands rather than keep them up. And I see people lower their voices when they should speak up.

I’ve seen over and over how much self-belief drives outcomes. And that’s why I force myself to sit at the table, even when I am not sure I belong there — and yes, this still happens to me. And when I’m not sure anyone wants my opinion, I take a deep breath and speak up anyway.

Believing in yourself was part of what got you to this special day. Continue to believe in yourselves. Don’t let anyone put limits on you. Don’t put limits on yourself. Know that you can and will go on to complete more school if that is what you want to do. Know that you can work hard to get the job you want — even if it takes doing other jobs on your way there. Know that if you want to, you can provide for yourselves and your family. Know that you can and will make the world a better place.Second, plan and chase your dream.

Getting from point A to point Z can be daunting unless you remember that you don’t have to get from A to Z. You just have to get from A to B.  Breaking big dreams into small steps is the way to move forward.

I grew up in Miami, and when I was 16, I went skiing for the first time. I had barely ever seen snow before and was really unathletic, so I was scared. To make matters worse, my mother and I went up the mountain and took a wrong turn and wound up on a hard run. I looked down the mountain and panicked — tears poured down my face as my heart raced, and I told my mother I would never make it down. She told me not to think about getting all the way down, but instead, just take 10 turns. So I did. And then another 10 turns and then another. Looking at everything that needs to get done is overwhelming and can paralyze us with fear. Breaking the larger task down into bite-size pieces that we know we can handle works. As you can tell by my presence here today, I made it off that mountain.

I felt that same feeling of “I can’t do this” panic when I started my first job after college. I was a researcher at the World Bank, and early on, I was asked to perform some calculations. I had no idea how to proceed, so I turned to my boss for help. “Just put it into Lotus 1-2-3” — yes, again, I am old, as I imagine none of you have even heard of that program. I told him that I didn’t know how to do that. “Wow,” he exclaimed. “I can’t believe you got this job without knowing how to use Lotus.” I went home convinced that I was going to get fired. The next day, my boss sat me down. My heart was pounding. But instead of firing me, he taught me how to use the program. He was a great boss. But I also learned an important truth: When you need help — and we all do — ask for it. Requesting help is a sign of strength not weakness.So keep an eye on your goal, but also know that it will take a lot of turns to get there. Know that your career — and your life — will have starts and stops, zigs and zags, twists and turns. This is especially true in an economy where you may have to take the job you can get as opposed to the job you want. Focus on taking full advantage of any opportunity to develop your skills. Each of us makes her own way in her own time. You may not love every job you have, but try and learn from all of them.

And the third thing is to know that the world needs you to change it.

Last year, I wrote a book called “Lean In” about inequality between men and women. It turns out — get ready for this shocker — that men still run the world. And I’m not sure it’s going that well. 

I believe that the world would be a better place if it were more equal — if we gave all of our children the education they deserve, if we had leaders of different genders, backgrounds and perspectives at the tables where decisions are made.

Sadly, my generation failed. We made progress, but we are still far from that 50-50 dream of mine where women will run half of our countries and companies and men will run half of our homes. We have elected an African-American president, but we are still far from giving equal opportunity to people regardless of race. So we turn to you. You are the promise for a more equal world.  

There is no finer example of what one person can do than Chancellor (Cheryl) Hyman. She graduated from City Colleges. She stood in the same place you are today. Four years ago, she helped launch the Reinvention of City Colleges to ensure every student finds success. In a short time, this data-driven revamp has nearly doubled the graduation rate. And this year we are celebrating what is expected to be the highest number of graduates in City Colleges’ history.

One person can make a difference. You can make a difference. I believe you can do anything that you set your mind to if you are willing to seek help and build skills. I know the world is filled with obstacles, but I believe you can find a way around them.

Your life’s course will not be determined by doing the things that you are certain you can do. Those are the easy things. It will be determined by whether you try the things that are hard. The jobs you want, realize you are not qualified for, and then work like crazy to get the necessary skills. The moments when you feel alone, ask for help, and create a bond with someone because working together helps them as well as you. The times when you see things nobody else sees, and fear speaking out because how can you really be right when everyone else sees it differently? But you speak out anyway ... and convince everyone else. Those are the moments where you can have real impact.

Don’t let yourself off the hook by deciding that something is out of your reach. You’ll never know what you’re capable of unless you try.And to quote Chancellor Hyman herself from an essay she wrote for the Lean In website: “If you embrace challenges, no matter how big, and keep moving forward, one day you will look up and be surprised at how far you have come.”

Not just you — but all the rising women and men in the Class of 2014. This is how your generation can become the Lean In Generation. The generation that knows no boundaries, fears no fears, and changes the world.

You stand here today, proud and brave. One goal down ... so many more to go. Start by figuring out where you want to go — and aiming high. Then take the first step in that direction.

Believe in yourself. Your families, friends and classmates are all rooting for you. I am rooting for you. I urge you to dream the possible dream. 

At Facebook, we have red posters hung on walls all around our campus with slogans that inspire us to dream our dreams. One says, “Fortune favors the bold.” Another says, “Done is better than perfect.” My favorite says, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”

So on this day when you’re celebrating years of hard work, don’t just think about the past. Look to the future. Take a moment and ask yourself, “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?” 

And then go do it. Congratulations!

Thank you so much for the warm welcome.

My fellow entrepreneurs: it is a privilege to be among the first people to congratulate you on completing your time at Babson.

I am especially honored to be here because I have had the privilege of working with the Babson community and I am in awe of what you do.

There are many incredible colleges that teach business.

But there is only one school that has focused its curriculum on entrepreneurship for the past 35 years . . .

—only one school whose undergraduate and graduate programs are ranked #1 in entrepreneurship . . .

—and only one school that has literally written the book on “the new entrepreneurial leader.”

The path you’ve embarked on is truly exciting, but it can also be challenging.

Here’s what Babson has taught you: Being an entrepreneur isn’t just a job title, and it isn’t just about starting a company. It’s a state of mind.

It’s about seeing connections others can’t, seizing opportunities others won’t, and forging new directions that others haven’t.

It’s about being entrepreneurial wherever you are and in whatever you do.

It’s about having the courage to give in to passion for an idea that makes your heart race.

If it doesn’t scare you, you’re probably not dreaming big enough.

Here is what I’ve learned: We may live in an age of instant messaging, instant gratification, and Instagram, but there is no way to short circuit the path to success. It takes hard work, tenacity and patience.

There are many things you can do overnight. You can write a decent paper. You can put the finishing touches on a runway show. I hear you can even have a pretty good time at Roger’s Pub.

But there is no such thing as an overnight success.

It’s a myth that glosses over what being an entrepreneur is all about. As Biz Stone, one of the founders of Twitter, put it: “Timing, perseverance, and 10 years of really hard work will eventually make you look like an overnight success.”

The good news is that if you’re willing to pursue your passion, put in the hard work, and believe in yourself, you will succeed.

That’s something that I didn’t know when I was your age.

When I was sitting where you are today, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

I had grown up on a farm outside of Philadelphia. I was a tomboy, who spent all of my time playing outdoors with my three brothers. My interest in fashion was limited.

In fact, I didn’t put on a dress until my senior prom, but fashion was clearly in my DNA. My parents had impeccable style. I channeled their love for beauty into a love for art and design, and went to the University of Pennsylvania to study art history.

I applied for many jobs my senior year of college. There was a Yugoslavian designer whose clothes my mother wore. His name was Zoran and three days before graduation, I cold-called him and asked for a job. He said yes, on one condition—I had to start in a week. On graduation day, all I could think about was finding an apartment in New York.

It was a whole new world. Zoran was a true eccentric with a long black beard that last year’s Red Sox team would have admired. He was minimalist. Everything in the office was white, there were no chairs—and the vodka started flowing at 10 a.m..

As his assistant, I did everything from getting coffee to running interference. People would come to the office, and Zoran would hide in the bathroom. I’d have to pretend he wasn’t there.

It was a fantastic entrée into the fashion industry. I was exposed to all the elements of a designer’s world, from designing a collection to managing press to learning about the business side. Fashion quickly became my passion.

While at Zoran, I was offered a job at Harper’s Bazaar. From there, I moved into PR and marketing—first at Ralph Lauren, then at Vera Wang, and then working for Loewe.

What I learned is what Babson taught all of you: even if you’re not yet an entrepreneur, you can be entrepreneurial in everything you do. If you view each stop as an opportunity to learn something, there is always something you will take away from that experience.

While at Loewe, I was offered the job of President at about the same time that I learned I was pregnant with my third son. I realized I couldn’t do that job and be the kind of mom I wanted to be so I decided to take some time off to focus on my family. It was a tough decision. Having a career was important to me—and I knew it would be part of my life again.

It was during that time that I began developing the concept for my company. It all started when I noticed a void in my own closet for beautifully designed, classic pieces that didn’t cost a fortune. It wasn’t just a void in my closet; it turned out to be a white space in the market.

I started working out of my apartment with a small team that could help me turn my concept into a reality.

Like most start-ups, we had to fundraise. I asked a lot of people I knew to invest, including some people who couldn’t easily afford it. I was terrified of losing people’s money, so I told them “only invest if you’re prepared to lose it.” Over 100 people said yes.

With the money we raised and a personal investment, we set up an office in Hong Kong for production and sourcing and I traveled there often. When I was home, we talked every evening. Given the time difference, that meant I’d be on conference calls until 3 or 4 in the morning. On those nights, my definition of success was not dozing off on the phone.

We also leased a small space on a low-rent corner of Manhattan—and ordered a first shipment of products to fill it. I was warned many times against opening a retail store. There were a lot of naysayers who thought I should start with a wholesale partner and build the brand from there. But I wanted a unique experience. Retail design at the time was very spare. I wanted to do something different. I wanted the boutique to be warm and inviting, like you were walking into a room in someone’s home. It was also unusual to launch with multiple categories and ecommerce, but from Day 1 it was a lifestyle brand.

We opened our first store in February 2004, during New York Fashion Week. My stepdaughters and I worked through the night to get everything ready. We opened our doors at 10—without the actual doors, which hadn’t arrived. I was afraid no one would come, but thankfully, the space became so packed that women were trying on clothes in the middle of the store. By 6 p.m., we’d sold through nearly all of our inventory.

A few months later, we got a call from Oprah. I thought it was one of my brothers playing a joke on me. “Yes sure, I’ll cancel spring break to be on Oprah.”

After I appeared on Oprah, our website got eight million hits. The media called us an overnight success. I guess that made sense—if you didn’t count the 20,000 hours we put into building the business up to that day, or the combined half a million hours we all spent learning the industry in the years before that.

Today, we are a global brand with more than 120 freestanding boutiques and a presence in more than 3,000 department and specialty stores worldwide.

From the beginning, one of the reasons I wanted to start a company was to start a foundation. Social responsibility was always part of the business plan. This was not always viewed as a positive—some people told me never to mention the word social responsibility and business in the same sentence. That only made me more determined.

I knew our foundation would benefit women and children. We had learned so much from our experiences starting a business that we thought we could help other women who wanted to do the same.

In 2009 we launched our foundation to support the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and their families. It has been incredibly meaningful not only to me personally, but to our customer, our employees and our business partners, all of whom care about giving back and helping women.

In 2012, we partnered with Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses to offer a nine-week MBA course for promising women entrepreneurs with no formal business education. I am proud to say that the school that helped us design that program was Babson.

This January, in partnership with Bank of America, we launched an initiative called Elizabeth Street Capital, named for the location of our first store. Through this initiative we are providing women entrepreneurs with access to the capital and mentoring support they need to launch and scale their businesses. I hope some of you will come to us when you’re ready!

Today, it has been ten years since we launched and in many ways I feel like we’re just beginning, but I never could have gotten here overnight.

One of the best pieces of advice I ever received from my parents is to think of negativity as noise. Believe in yourself and what you’re doing.

Remember: if the most unique ideas were obvious to everyone, there wouldn’t be entrepreneurs. The one thing that every entrepreneurial journey has in common is that there are many, many steps on the road to success.

Thank you for the opportunity today to be a part of yours.

President Rhodes, graduates, families, faculty, and staff. And most importantly, the all-powerful and extremely good-looking board of trustees. Which happens to include my Mother.

Congratulations, graduates. You guys are the heroes. I know it’s been hard to get here. For many of you, it’s been harder than it should have been. I have deep admiration for what you’ve done. I’m moved by what your friends and families have sacrificed. Whatever I say today is lucky to be an asterisk in your life story.

Now for those of you from Oklahoma, an asterisk is the star below the number 7 on your telephone. Just kidding. Rotary dial phones don’t have asterisks.

Almost every commencement speech can be summed up in a few pithy aphorisms: be grateful, love one another, dream big, never give up, and change the world. I could say all those and be done. You might actually prefer that.

But I don’t want to give you a regular graduation speech. Your time is too precious for that. Besides, it’s really easy to go on YouTube to see Puff Daddy’s commencement speech from earlier this year. He says just what I told you, but it’s way more entertaining.

Instead, I’ve decided today to give you three love letters. Simple. Three letters expressing my affection. The first love letter is from me to the city of Austin. The second one, from me to America. And the third, from me to you.

Love letter #1: Austin.Even though I don’t live here now, this city means a lot to me. It’s one of the first great loves of my life. It’s where I came of age, where I learned to be a young man.

It’s where I learned some simple values, like the importance of handshakes and speaking plainly. It’s where I learned the power of music authentically expressed, like the cry of a steel guitar, or cowboy songs around a campfire late at night.

It’s where I learned to dream. I still remember going with friends to Enchanted Rock one time, and counting over 30 shooting stars while lying on our backs. It was like we were on the prow of Spaceship Earth. We had the whole world below us, as we hurtled forward into the universe above us.

I still remember moving to Austin as a teenager, and realizing that I’d never tasted such a place before. Austin has a flavor that is unique. It lingers in the soul. It wasn’t until I grew up that I realized how special and rare that flavor is in the world.

A full generation has passed since that time, and things change. Austin has boomed. And Austinites can be rather nostalgic these days. One generation ago, Whole Foods was a “small neighborhood grocery.” Those are the words from the corporate website. Today, there are over 360 such “small neighborhood groceries” around the world.

One generation ago, South by Southwest was a bracelet you bought to go barhopping and hear local bands play. Today, multinational corporations sponsor events at “South By” to market new products to millions of consumers.

One generation ago, when I talked with people outside the state of Texas, Austin was often confused with Houston. Now, Houston is sometimes confused with Austin. Sorry, Houstonians.

Here’s what I’ve come to realize. Austin was special because it was at the edge of the frontier. Not just the geographical frontier. It was at the edge of cultural frontiers, a collision of different ways of living. The mashup of cowboys, hippies, intellectuals, and civic leaders created its own music that still echoes in the hills today. And each of those components played a role. Gritty bluntness from the cowboys. Open-heartedness from the hippies. Love of ideas from the academics. Grand ambition from the civic leaders.

Those were the lines of code in the original operating system of Austin. That software program simply ran its course over several decades. One generation later, and I can still taste that Austin. The flavor will remain on my tastebuds until I die.

Here’s the takeaway lesson. There is a natural power at the edges of frontiers. When you go fishing, the best places to drop your line are at the transition points, where light meets dark, shallow meets deep, fast meets slow. The same is true for human life. When you go searching for your fortune in life, look for those transition points. That’s the frontier. That was Austin.

My second love letter is to America. I love this country. The irony is that, when growing up, I never felt truly American, as the son of Chinese immigrants in Middle America. But with time, I’ve come to realize that I am actually more American than many, quote, “Americans.”

I’ve seen and understood this country in ways that others haven’t. I’ve been to every state in the union. I’ve lived in a bunch of them. I’ve breathed in almost every corner of America, small town and large, rural and urban, East and West, North and South.

I remember when soccer moms were just called moms. I remember when a new neighbor was greeted with freshly baked cake.

I also remember something my Father said to me when I was young. He said that a lot of cultures claim to be the nicest in the world. But of all the places he had been, Americans were the warmest to strangers. I wasn’t sure if I believed him back then. But I’ve traveled the world, seen over 50 countries. And I’ve concluded my Father was right. America is the warmest country to strangers. Not perfect, for sure, but far better than anywhere else.

Why is this? It’s not just about nice manners. What I’ve learned is that the answer goes to the heart of America.

This is a country built on the good faith of strangers. The next time you walk into a coffee shop, look closely. Look at who is doing what. You’ll definitely see lots of old friends, families, and neighbors catching up. But in America, you’ll also see something that is rare elsewhere in the world. You’ll see lots of people doing things together who just met a short time ago. This is a land where people take chances on strangers, because we all are. Strangers become friends quickly, because we need each other to survive and get things done.

Imagine you were alive six generations ago, and you wanted to cross America by wagon. You had a six-month journey across the frontier. You risked starvation, disease, injury, and attacks. Before they started, strangers would form wagon caravans of up to 300 people they had never met before. They entrusted their lives to each other, taking the gamble that the unknown dangers ahead were still better than the world they had left behind. It was the ultimate startup company. In comparison, a startup company today in Silicon Valley making dating apps sounds pretty ridiculous.

Frontiers require strangers to come together, and form teams to achieve common ends. The process is not always pretty, because strangers tend to disagree, distrust, bicker, and fight. But in the end—over the long arc of history—it creates something beautiful. Like the collision of cultures that made Austin.

The frontier story, I believe, is the American story. But it’s also the reason that America is struggling today. We’ve already built a great society. We’ve conquered a frontier. But now, in the new millennium, Americans look around at each other and are saying, “Now what?”

When we have no more frontier to conquer, we start feeding on ourselves. Thus, we see infighting. We see polarization. We are suffering today from the end of the American Frontier.

So my love letter to this beautiful country ends with simply this. Don’t let the end of the American Frontier be the end of the American story. It’s time to create a new American mission. After we have conquered the physical frontier, what new frontiers can challenge and bring this nation together?

My third, and most important, love letter is for you. I don’t know many of you personally, but I already know who you are. I know because we are fellow human beings. You have some things you’re good at. You have far more things you’re bad at. You love some people a lot, others not so much. You wish the world would work more the way you think it should.

And you worry. You worry if you can achieve the life you want to be happy. You worry that I’m going to keep talking for too long.

So here’s a big secret. Most adults are pretending. Status, intelligence, beauty, wealth, achievement. The older you get, the more you see people pretending in little ways all the time. People drop names to make themselves look more important. They try to assert power, to make the world seem less terrifying. They post pictures on Facebook to prove how “exciting” their lives are. In this society built on shifting frontiers, where we rely on strangers, we worry a lot about our place. There is so much uncertainty.

It’s human nature to worry. Our tendency, as frail biological creatures, is to pretend to be bigger than we are. Or to run away.

But I would ask you to fight this instinct. Your mission—as a citizen of Austin, America, and the human race—is to remake the frontier, every day, in little ways. This requires you to be comfortable with uncomfortable things. This is not easy. In frontiers, people often look different, speak strange languages, behave oddly, believe differently. Some of them will hurt you. But the vast majority of them won’t.

So to renew the frontier every day, what do you do? Let me offer some pithy aphorisms, since this is a graduation after all. Hopefully these can be new sayings for a new era. I’ve got seven.

Be uncomfortable.
Open doors.
Empathize with strangers. 
Try new things out. 
Seek serendipity. 
Take chances with new friends. 
And pay it forward to people you don’t know. 

These are really hard things to do, because most of the time our instincts push us the opposite way. But these are the origins of the American frontier story, the roots of Austin’s beloved culture, and the future to your success in the new economy.

That’s how my three love letters are connected together. While life is often determined by dumb luck, these are the ways to tilt the odds of dumb luck in your favor.

Thank you for listening. It’s not often one gets such a privilege, and I humbly hope I’ve taken your time well.

To Austin, stay weird. To America, keep the frontier fresh. And to you, may you forever thrive at the frontier’s edge, where the known confronts the unknown.

Best wishes, congratulations, and much love to all of you.

PAUL: When most people think of Zingerman’s success, they picture a line of people stretching from Detroit St. to Division, A sandwich so big it takes two hands to pick it up. And when you finally bite into it the Russian dressing rolls down your arms. Reporters write about our vision, our values, and our marketing skills.

ARI: There’s huge value, of course, to each of those things.  But what very few folks ever ask, what reporters rarely write about, and what hardly anyone seems to really be all that interested in, is what we believe. While vision, values, quality, customer service, marketing, and making money are all important, we believe . . . that what we believe . . . makes a big difference! The beliefs that we choose—or those we hold, but don’t acknowledge—will form the footprint for everything else that happens in our lives. As writer Claude Bristol said 75 years ago, “As individuals think and believe, so they are.”

PAUL: To be clear, it’s not for us to tell you what to do with your lives once you leave here.

ARI: But we can share with you some of the key beliefs that underlie all that we’ve done in our organization, beliefs that have laid the base for us to build a healthy business that provides meaningful employment to over 700 people. Beliefs that contribute positively to our community in many, many ways. Beliefs about people and processes that are being adapted in places as far afield as Australia, Slovakia, and Ethiopia. Beliefs that have helped build a business that—33 years later—we both still love working in, literally, every single day. Paul?

PAUL: I believe it’s rarely a good idea to read the comments others make about you on social media, but who can resist? Right after we were named as commencement speakers, I read this post: “WOW, WHOEVER WAS THE FIRST CHOICE MUST HAVE BACKED OUT.” I laughed, too, but it hit me what an immense honor and opportunity this was. In the interest of reciprocity, I committed to give to you the best of what I have to offer . . . other than a $16 Rueben.

To do that Class of 2015, mentally pull up your “Must Have” list for success and scan it. Really, take it out and give it a good look. Raise your hand if joy is at the top of that list? It wasn’t on my list when I graduated from this fine institution. Joy is not the typical yardstick of success. Will the bank ask for your joy quotient when you renegotiate your student loans? Not likely. So why would you want joy on your list, and what IS it, anyway?

Joy is a feeling so profound that it sits at the top of the human experience chart. Just above love and just below peace and enlightenment. To feel joy, you don’t have to wait until you’re old, like us, I believe you can have it now, starting today. How? Generosity.Generosity leads to joy. It’s simple and it’s guaranteed.

Generosity follows the natural law of the harvest—you reap more than you sow. When you give, you get more back. Minimally, you get a joy buzz. Research tells us that generosity kicks off a “feel good” hormone in your brain called the “helper’s high” that can last up to two hours…and it’s legal. Even outside of Ann Arbor.

I am not telling you to take a vow of poverty. Earn money, as much as you like. See the world. Buy a nice car. Get rewarded for hard work. Just know that these things don’t bring joy like being generous does.

Another natural law of generosity is that it’s self-perpetuating—just like the yeasty starter the Bakehouse uses to bake zillions of loaves of Zingerman’s rye and sourdough breads. What applies to bread applies to people. The mother starter of Generosity is also passed down through generations. This was proven in a study by the National Academy of Science where one person’s act of generosity inspired others to be generous, spreading to dozens, even hundreds, of people, known and unknown.

I’ve got my own proof for you: three true stories from my life illustrating the natural laws of generosity.

I’ll begin with “my starter”—my grandfather, Ben Sherman. We called him Zadie. That’s Yiddish for grandfather. I think about his big smile and hearty laugh, how he warmed me with his presence. I realize now that he was joyful because he embodied generosity. In my early teens, I worked at his machine shop in a rough part of Detroit. Frequently, homeless men wandered into the shop looking for a hand out, and Zadie invited each one to go next door to Joe’s Bar and Grille, saying, “Get yourself a hot meal and put it on my tab.” Zadie told me two things I’ll never forget: “Half of what you have belongs to those who need it,” and “If you’re successful, make the people around you successful.” With this wisdom in mind, Ari and I added the crucial ingredient of generosity into Zingerman’s business plan from day one.

My second story has Mrs. Johnnie Mae Seeley as the “starter.” She is a tiny, elderly angel in our neighborhood who got the Deli to bag up our unsold bread and rolls every night for her church to parcel out. Her generous act inspired Zingerman’s to found and launch the nonprofit Food Gatherers in 1988 with a mission to eradicate hunger in our county. 27 years later, Food Gatherers distributes over 6 million pounds of food every year to our neighbors in need. Every day I feel profound joy for the work Food Gatherers does in our community.

My final story demonstrates how Zingerman’s Community of Businesses, our partnership model based on Zadie’s advice of making those around you successful, was put to the test in 2001. Ari and I had pledged a quarter of a million dollars to build a shiny commercial kitchen inside the county’s new homeless shelter. Our funding was to come from a business venture slated to open at Detroit’s new McNamara Terminal. Several days after 9/11, the airport project folded, and our kitchen funding vanished. When I heard this, I actually had to lie down on the floor of my office for over an hour. Ari and I had to break the news to all of our Zingerman’s partners in the wake of the national tragedy. It was agonizing. How were we going to honor our commitment? What happened next would have made Zadie and Mrs. Seeley weep with joy. Our partners shocked us with their decision to take on the entire quarter million dollars. I was stunned and overcome with joy our partners had now become the next generation of starters. Seeded by their generosity, today that kitchen prepares one hundred thousand hot meals each year.

So . . . when you leave here today with your Must Have list, I invite to measure your success, not so much by what you gain or accomplish for yourself, but rather by what you contribute to others. I believe practicing generosity is the way to joy. It’s free for the taking. Or should I say . . . for the giving.

Ari? I told them what I believe. What do you believe?

ARI: I believe that active, engaging, interesting learning is very clearly at the core of a great life.   Probably the one thing that this amazing institution—of which everyone, in this very big emotional and intellectual house, is a part—has been trained in, more than any other single thing, is how to learn. The challenge though is that, when you leave here today, there are no more grades to be gotten, no more professors to pass judgment. And when there’s no one pressuring us do to it, there are a hundred reasons not to open a book, not to go to an interesting lecture, not to read a poem. Working hard at learning doesn’t win headlines, but it’s clear to me that the people who keep doing it regularly almost always live powerfully positive lives.

I believe that our lives are radically more rewarding when we actively own our choices. I wish I’d understood this the day I graduated—unfortunately it took me another fifteen years to figure it out.  Owning my own choices changed my life. The reality of the world is that—everything I do, everything you do, is a choice. No one made us go to school, no one makes us to go work, or read a book or be kind. No one makes us do anything.  We can choose to be generous, we can choose to care, we can choose to make a positive difference. Perhaps most powerfully of all—if we choose to pay attention—we have the power to choose what we believe.

I believe that, although history focuses mostly on the big headlines, it’s really the little things that matter most. Your grandmother’s hug today. The notes you took on your favorite book assignment this year. The small gesture of generosity you did to help someone in need. A thank-you note to the people who clean the rooms, and run the phones, and make this university go, so that you and I could go to class and get grades and graduate. In that sense, I believe with great strength that everything matters and everyone matters. The people who are least likely to be consulted in a company, or included in society. The sky. A smile. The stars. Your mother. This moment. Your dog. The person you walked by on the stairs on the way in, and the one you walk by again on the way out.

I believe that simple kindness matters more than most people will admit. That if instead of getting angry at others, we appreciate; that instead of blaming, we give blessings; that instead of keeping score we live out the generosity of spirit that Paul just detailed so powerfully. Kindness is free, and kindness counts! We believe what Paul Hawken wrote: “Being a good human being is good business.”

I believe that—contrary to what much of the world would say—hard work can be one of the most rewarding things one ever engages in.  Not just any work, but good work, work you believe in, work that brings the generosity and joy that Paul just talked about so beautifully; work that makes a positive difference for you, for the world; work that matters, work that you care about. Hard work like that may not get the glamor, but it is almost always exceptionally rewarding.

I believe that perhaps the hardest work we have to undertake is the work no one else sees, and that no else can ever do for us. It’s the lifelong challenge to manage ourselves effectively, to make peace with ourselves and turn our natural ability into a positive and powerful presence in the world. Although it almost never comes up in post-graduate conversation it’s at the core of everything else we will ever do for the rest of our lives.

I believe that everyone—everyone—in the world is a unique, caring, creative, individual. Walking our own way while still respecting the world around us is no small feat. Holding our own course can be uncomfortable, but it’s essential if we’re going to truly live lives that we—not everyone else who has input—really own. Despite what higher ups in the hierarchy might tell you, I believe what Rollo May wrote—that “The opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, it’s conformity.”

It was hard for me to comprehend when I was 21 but I believe, ever more strongly with each passing day, that every single minute really does matter. Life, when it comes down to it, is very, very short. There are a thousand reasons to sleep in, to drink another beer, to put things off till tomorrow or two weeks from Tuesday. But I believe what author Annie Dillard said—that, “The way we spend our days is the way we spend our lives.” Every minute we spend worrying, every minute we spend waiting for someone else to improve, is a minute we don’t spend doing something meaningful for the people we care about, for the world, for ourselves.

I believe that going for greatness, greatness as you—and not everyone else in the world—defines it, is energizing. I believe that uniqueness like that is exciting. Empowering. Emma Goldman said “When we can’t dream any longer we die.” Choosing greatness, choosing to push your own envelope, to find ways to be more generous, to find more joy, to learn more, study harder, and make a more positive difference is what leads to a great life.

I believe that one of the best ways to makes our lives into the artistic, positive, amazing existences we want to them to be, is to write out a vision of what that life will look like when we’ve successfully made it a reality. I believe that anyone of you who is willing push “pause,” and to gently ask the voices in their heads to step aside for an hour so you can write out that kind of personal vision of greatness, their true dream, can come darned close to making that life a reality. They may not make the most money, they may not have the fanciest car, but they will find fulfillment and equally importantly they will help many others find it as well. The visioning process, the initial work on which was done here at U of M fifty years ago, is the single best tool I know to make that happen. And I’m happy—though it might take a while if you all take me up on it – to meet with any graduate who wants help with the visioning process. I believe that anyone who does that work will pretty surely lead an amazing life.

Most importantly, for today’s purposes, I believe in YOU—by dint of the fact that you have done what you have done to earn the right to be here today, both you and the world know that you have the intelligence, you have the emotional resilience, you have the connections, you have the capability, to do great things. To help make the world a meaningfully better place than it was yesterday   You have the power. As African American anarchist Ashanti Alston said: “You all can do this. You have the vision. You have the creativity. Do not allow anyone to lock that down.”

PAUL: Class of 2015, congratulations! Be generous!

ARI: Be joyful!

PAUL: Be great!

ARI: Make a difference!

Thank you so much, President Hill, Members of the Board of Trustees, distinguished alumni, members of the faculty, devoted parents and friends, and especially the fabulous Vassar College Class of 2015. I am deeply grateful to have been invited to be part of such a special moment in your lives. Commencement is one of my favorite rituals — coming together for one last time, dressed alike before you head off into your singular and unique lives. When I was deciding what to wear under my gown, I asked Siri what the weather was in Poughkeepsie. And Siri responded with a list of mixed drinks with whiskey. I think I’m going to wait until Siri comes up with an update for Greek accents.

Today is the culmination of your time at Vassar. And it’s also a mini-culmination for me. Because I’ve spent a lot of time in recent weeks getting to know you — following you and your activities on social media, on Vassar’s website, in The Miscellany News, and in other ways I’m not prepared to disclose that will remain between me and the folks at the NSA. It feels a little like I’ve been checking out your online dating profile, and now we’re finally meeting. And when I saw you walk in, all 611 of you, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Because let’s face it, you look fantastic. If we were on Tinder, I would definitely be ready to swipe right. Or is it left? Actually, at my age, it doesn’t matter, as long as you’re swiping.

One of the things I learned from my cyber-stalking is that the Vassar College seal shows the goddess Athena in front of the Parthenon, which I love. Though it occurs to me that I’m probably here because Athena couldn’t be booked, so you settled for another Greek lady from Athens. And to really sell it, I’ll be delivering my speech in a thick, sometimes- hard-to-understand Greek accent, instead of the crystal clear, accentless voice I use at all other times. In my private detective work, I also learned that your former motto “purity and wisdom” was abandoned in 1930, which was probably a good idea given that when The Miscellany News — or the Misc as I understand you call it — sent out an email to seniors asking what was on their bucket list, most of the answers had to do with sex. One replied, “Have sex under the sex tree!” Another said, “Have sex in the circle couches near the Art Library.” A third wrote back, “Sex in the meditation room or the roof of the library.” Aren’t you glad I’m not disclosing your names in front of your parents? You owe me!

What was clear from all my private detective work is that you belong to a community. And for the rest of your lives, you’ll essentially have a language you speak that no one else understands...sort of a more fun version of how I’ve been feeling my whole life. Chili Wednesdays at The Retreat. The Bell Ringing. Founder’s Day. Mug Nights. A Quidditch team, The Butterbeer Brooers. The Deece. Running naked through the library the night before final exams. The Vassar Devil, which I understand to be some sort of ice cream sensation I’m definitely planning to sample before I leave. The a cappella groups — all 3,475 of them.

And what a treasure trove of stories you’re leaving Vassar with. Not just from your years here but from Vassar’s incredibly colorful past: Way back in the 1880s, you invented fudge — maybe. Some of you actually believe that the squirrels around campus are the slightly deranged reincarnations of English majors who couldn’t get jobs after graduation. But, hey, at least the squirrels aren’t living at home, right mom and dad? And here is my favorite: before your time, Vassar students were given the emblem of an acorn to display on their doors when they did not wish to be disturbed. The custom was apparently discontinued, but I want to urge you to revive it as something to use physically and spiritually for the rest of your lives. It’s actually central to the three relationships I want to talk to you about today. And those are: your relationship with technology, your relationship with yourself, and your relationship with the world.

Let’s start with your relationship with technology. No generation has been as liberated and as connected by technology as yours. But also, no generation has been as enslaved and as distracted by technology. So bring on that acorn because as the writer Eric Barker said, “Those who can sit in a chair, undistracted for hours, mastering subjects and creating things will rule the world — while the rest of us frantically and futilely try to keep up with texts, tweets and other incessant interruptions.” Sadly, we have become not just distracted by our devices, our texts, emails, constant notifications, and social media, but addicted to them. And when it comes to social media, let me break it to you: our addiction is not a bug, but a feature. This isn’t some unforeseen side effect, it was always the intention, that social media would consume as much of our time and attention — as much of our lives — as possible.

To your credit, many of you have already recognized this and have taken steps to curb this addiction. As senior Justin Mitchell told the Misc, “I was mindlessly going through people’s profiles and being an idiot. So I cut it out. There’s just not enough time to do that with school.” And having graduated just a few years before you, I can tell you there is even less time to do that with life.

But the addiction is so powerful that, according to a recent survey, 20 percent of millennials actually use their smartphones during sex. Maybe I should have read the instructions on my phone more carefully, but I’m not even sure what that means. Indeed, a recent study shows that more than half of women would rather go a month with no sex than a month with no smartphone — although I am sure this survey did not include any women with access to the Vassar Sex Tree.

Contrary to what many of you may think, not only is multitasking not very efficient, it doesn’t actually exist. It’s actually rapid task switching — instead of doing two things at once, we simply switch between doing two things badly. It’s one of the most stressful ways we can use our time, and it robs us of our capacity to notice and appreciate every moment of our lives. I live in New York, and you hardly ever see anybody simply walking down the street who’s not also staring at a screen, talking on the phone, or, even worse, texting while walking. It’s like being in a really boring zombie movie. I used to be exactly like that myself. I remember one day, I left my apartment with a friend. I looked up and said, “What a gorgeous building! I wonder when that went up?” “1890” my friend said. I’d never noticed it. As Vassar alum Mary Oliver put it, “Instructions for living a life: Pay attention. Be Astonished. Tell about it.” And by the way, when you do, please tell about it on The Huffington Post. I’m going to make it super easy for you by giving you my email so you can bypass the growing HuffPost blogging bureaucracy: arianna@huffingtonpost.com.

As someone who runs a 24/7 digital media company and who uses every form of social media ever invented, I hope I have some street cred when I urge you to build boundaries, introduce digital detoxes into your life, and learn to regularly disconnect from the jumble and the cacophony and make time to reconnect with yourself. There will be many profound and fulfilling relationships ahead of you, but the relationship with yourself is the most important relationship you’ll ever have. And, like any relationship, it can’t be taken for granted — without care and attention, it will atrophy and, ultimately, break down.

If there is one thing I wish I knew when I was sitting where you are today — and by the way, there are many — it’s that the Delphic admonition “Know Thyself” and Socrates’ admonition that “the unexamined life is not worth living” are not ancient philosophical platitudes, but in fact the most relevant and important guiding truths for our lives. In the well-earned rush and excitement of your new life that’s about to begin, it’s remarkably easy to forget that most important relationship. That’s because the ever-increasing creep of technology — into our bedrooms, our brains, and our lives — makes it much harder to connect with ourselves.

Indeed, for so many of us, connecting with ourselves has been so neglected that we will do anything to avoid it. Researchers from Harvard and the University of Virginia did an experiment in which they gave people a choice to be alone in a room, without anything — no devices, no papers, no phones — or get an electric shock. A whopping 67 percent of men chose the electric shock. I’m very happy to say that only 25 percent of women chose the shock. Seriously guys — and a quarter of women — what is wrong with you? It’s not like you have to go shopping with your own thoughts or move in with them and pick out drapes, just be alone with them for fifteen minutes. Is it that bad?

In fact most of us actually know more about the state of our smartphones than we do about the state of ourselves. I bet pretty much everyone here knows approximately how much battery remains in your smartphone right now. And when it gets below 20%, giving us the dreaded red low power alert, we begin to get anxious and desperately look around for one of the little recharging shrines we meticulously maintain everywhere around us, lest anything should happen to our precious phone. But how much do you know, how aware are you, how mindful are you, of the state of your own being? Of your own energy and alertness and reserves? How quickly do you spring into action when you go into the low power zone?

I was fascinated to read about Vassar’s Maria Mitchell, America’s first female astronomer, and to see the gorgeous building that used to house her observatory. And while I completely understand the sense of wonder that has led men and women through the ages to explore outer space, I’m personally much more fascinated with exploring inner space. As Thomas Merton put it, “What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves? This is the most important of all voyages of discovery, and without it all the rest are not only useless but disastrous.” In other words, it’s the quality of our inner journeys that allows us to make sense of our outer journeys.

There is now a collective longing to stop living in the shallows and recognize that life is actually shaped from the inside out — a truth that has been celebrated by spiritual teachers, poets and philosophers throughout the ages and has now been unambiguously validated by modern science. And you, Vassar graduates, can lead the way, and chart a new path forward. You’re the first generation born into the digital world. And you can be the first generation to master it, to make it serve you, instead of the other way around. And when you do, you’ll find that you have the wind at your back because that’s what the times are calling for.

One of the things that’s so special about Vassar is that at the heart of your education is a deep and profound sense of responsibility for the world and those around us. You’ve been taught to use your considerable talents, and your drive and your dedication to make a difference in the world. I was moved and inspired by all the projects you’ve started and been involved in: The Vassar Prison Initiative, The Vassar Haiti Project, The College Committee on Sustainability, Operation Donation, etc., etc. You’ve already made a difference in the world you’re about to enter.

And it’s no accident that Vassar has recognized the crisis of growing inequality in our country. In fact, congratulations for being the number one college to enroll high-performing, low-income students and support them through successful graduation. The concern about growing inequality has become almost universal — transcending political parties and ideologies. The statistics are staggering: Student loan debt is at 1.2 trillion dollars, the number of Americans in poverty has grown by 15 million since 2000, the number of high-poverty neighborhoods has tripled since 1970, while America is now home to more prisoners than any other country in the world, with more than 2 million people behind bars.

As we see this happening, I keep being reminded of my visit to Pompeii, whose people were wiped out in the first century by a violent volcanic eruption. There had been many warning signs, including a severe earthquake, tremors, springs and wells that dried up, dogs that ran away, and birds that no longer sang. And then the most obvious warning sign: columns of smoke belching out of Mount Vesuvius before the volcano blew its top, burying the city and its inhabitants under sixty feet of ash and volcanic rock. But the warning signs had been dismissed as “not particularly alarming.” The warning signs are all around us today, too, pointing out the gulf between what we know we should be doing and what we’re choosing to do instead.

It’s not that we don’t have enough data — in fact, we’re drowning in data. What we’re lacking is wisdom. Indeed ninety percent of the data now available to us has been created in the last two years. But how much of our collective wisdom has been made available in that time? That’s what’s missing from our leaders and from our public discourse. Could our political debate, dominated as it is by meaningless head-to-head polls, manufactured controversies, horse-race sound-bites, and news of Hillary Clinton asking for extra guacamole at Chipotle and Ted Cruz suddenly liking country music after 9/11 — be any more trivialized?

In fact, at The Huffington Post we’ve started a “Who Cares?” section to cover all these non-issues and hopefully leave more room for the real ones. And for those of you going into journalism, our goal at HuffPost is to reimagine the craft. There’s an old saying in the news business, one that’s guided editorial thinking for decades: “If it bleeds, it leads.” But it turns out this is just lousy journalism. As journalists, our job is to provide an accurate picture — and that means the full picture — of what’s going on in the world. Just showing tragedy, violence, and mayhem — just focusing on what’s broken and what’s not working — misses too much of what is really happening all around us. What about how people are responding to these challenges, how they’re coming together, even in the midst of violence, poverty and loss? And what about all the stories of innovation, creativity, ingenuity, compassion and grace? By shining a light on these stories, we can scale up these solutions and create a positive contagion that can expand and broaden their reach. Instead of just producing copycat crimes, we can start to produce copycat solutions.

And you can be a part of those solutions. There is an invisible but very real and inescapable connection between our relationship with ourselves and our relationship with the world. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn put it, “If you wanted to put the world to rights, who should you begin with: yourself or others?” I know everyone here wants to help put the world to rights. But please remember, it begins with yourself... as they say on airplanes, secure your own oxygen mask first.

So regularly hang that virtual acorn on your door because while the world will provide plenty of insistent, pleading, flashing, high-volume signals directing you to distract yourself, to not be in the moment, to burn out in order to climb higher up the ladder of what the world defines as success, there will be almost no worldly signals reminding you to stay connected to the essence of who you are, to pause to wonder, and to connect to that place of wisdom in you — that place from which everything is possible. The world will keep coming at you with its incessant demands, beeps, blinking lights, and alerts. “Every day,” Iain Thomas wrote, “the world will drag you by the hand, yelling, ‘This is important! And this is important! And this is important! You need to worry about this! And This! And This!’ And each day, it’s up to you to yank your hand back, put it on your heart and say, ‘No. This is what’s important.’”

It’s from this sacred place that life is transformed from struggle to grace, from information to wisdom. We have, if we’re lucky, about 30,000 days to play the game of life. And trust me, that’s not morbid. In fact, it’s wisdom that will put all the inevitable failures and rejections and disappointments and heartbreaks into perspective. Because as the great Onion headline summed it up, “Death Rate Holding Steady at 100%” So let’s stop sweeping it under the rug. That’s a modern impulse. Ancient Romans would carve “MM,” Memento Mori, Remember Death, on statues and trees — to put every victory and every defeat into its proper perspective. I’m not sure if you want to carve it on the sex tree, though, because things could get weird.

And if you’ve been to a memorial service recently, you’ll have noticed that our eulogies have very little to do with our resumes and our LinkedIn profiles. For instance, here’s the sort of thing you don’t hear in a eulogy: “George was amazing, he increased market share by one-third.” Or, “her PowerPoint slides were always meticulously prepared.” Or, “she ate lunch at her desk every single day.” Our eulogies are always about the other stuff: what we gave, how we connected, how much we meant to our family and friends, small kindnesses, lifelong passions, and the things that made us laugh. So why do we spend so much of our lives chasing things we don’t value and that don’t ultimately matter?

As you leave this magical campus, don’t let technology wrap you up in a perpetually harried existence. Don’t be so connected to everybody that you’re not truly connected to anybody. Or to yourself. And don’t get so caught up in your busy life that life’s mystery passes you by. Bring joy and gratitude into every moment — even the tough ones — and start displaying that acorn on your door. Thank you so much.

Well, thank you so much. Laurie, thank you for that degree. Trustees, since I’ve been a trustee of the university, thank you for voting for me. Really appreciate that.

Let me also thank the graduates for letting me have the opportunity to be your commencement speaker. And lastly, in the thanks I’m going to give, I want to give a shout out to my sweetheart. I actually got that word from Laurie last night when we had dinner and I like that. So my sweetheart just came here this morning. Valerie, thank you for being here in this special occasion, appreciate it.

To the graduates of 2015, I will just simply say that I’m very proud of you. I know that your parents are proud of you. The family that’s here are proud of you and let’s all of us give them a hand for this wonderful day.


You know, as I look out among you, it really confirms a couple things that I believe and that is that there are no limits to human ingenuity or to human achievement. And the other is that we are infinite beings with infinite possibilities, all of you. And it is through that lens that I have really lived my life in fact and what I’d like to do is share with you some pieces of that life. And maybe answer that question in sharing my adventure, what it’s like to travel in space, because I know a lot of you see an astronaut, you’d want to know that. So I want to share that with you, but also some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.

And that first lesson goes like this— that dreams are your reality of the future. Now, how did I come about this? You already heard that I grew up on the Navajo Nation many years ago and I actually started out in Houston, Texas, in a very poor community. I came from a broken home.

There was a lot of struggles that I won’t go into, but fortunately my mother who was an educator got us out of that environment and took this to a land of grand canyons and painted deserts where I could now get out of that restrictive environment and now be in this environment where I could be free, where I could discover what my dreams and what my ambitions are. I also during that period discovered my talents. I discovered that I liked science and as you’ve heard in my introduction, you know that I like space science. You also know that I like Star Trek. Do we have any Star Trek fans out here? Yeah.


And so I discovered very early what those talents are, and this is an important lesson though I think— and you probably have done this already because you’re graduating today— and that is to spend the time with yourself to figure out what are those things that I do well. What are my innate abilities? And I was lucky enough to discover that.

One of the other things I discovered is that I like exploring and so my friends and I would take off in the mountains and we would go over the first hill, then go down in the valley, and go over the next hill, just to figure out what was out there. It’s kind of funny that Valerie teases me today because when we go to different places, the first thing I want to do, of course, is to go exploring. Well, that started very early in my life. I also learned in my life that I needed to raise my expectations.


And let me share with you how this came about. We would come back to Houston during the summers to visit our family and then stayed with my aunt in Houston, Texas. And my best friend was a guy by the name of Clevert Johnson and we would sit out on the curve— and I was about probably 11 years older so when this was happening— and we would just sort of dream. We’d sort of talk about our ambitions, what we wanted to do, what we would become.

And I remember one day we had this discussion about money, because one of things that Clevert said he wanted to do is that he wanted to become rich. And I said, wow, you know what? I never thought about that. So do I. So then he asked me, well, what do you think is a lot of money? And so I said, man, if I had $100,000, that’s a lot of money.”And he looked at me and said, $100,000? See, I have to remind you this is way back in the ’60s where if you were a millionaire, you actually had— you would live in a house that was worth $100,000, so that was a lot of money to me. He says, man, you’re thinking too small. I said, well, what do you think is a lot of money? He says, $10 million, or $100 million.

And I had never— you know, coming from my background, even considered that amount of money. And I remember leaving that afternoon, kind of thinking back and saying to myself, wow, I really have low expectations. I need to raise my expectations. So the lesson I want to pass on is that you need to raise your expectations of yourself.So I know that you have certain expectations, your family has certain expectations of you, but it’s important those expectations actually come from you. And speaking of expectations, I want to remind you, don’t let or don’t build your life around the expectations of others. So be careful with that, because I know that some of you in this room have graduated with this degree today because your parents encouraged you to go into engineering or encouraged you to go in whatever field that you’ve chosen. I’m speaking to those young people. Figure out with this degree, with this foundation that you have what it is that you really want to do.

Remember that it’s about passion and discovering your passion in life. And that’s most important. The second thing I want to share with you is— and I should answer this question of not only how did I make that transition for Star Trek to actually space— is that when I was 13 years old, I followed the early Space Program. I watched the U.S. and the Russians kind of battle each other to see who was going to get the moon first.And I remember on that glorious day in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon. And when they landed on the moon, it was an amazing thing for me to see. For the first time, human beings had left this planet and gone to another planet called the moon. Of course the moon is simply a planet locked into the earth’s gravity, and when I saw that, I knew what I wanted to do. I found my passion.

And so I set off on this course of trying to discover how I would get there. I realized when I started doing my research— I remember research, back in the day, required that I go to a library and not go to Google. And so I also learned a lot about the Space Program from the newspapers and magazines of the day. And what I discovered is that I couldn’t come to a college like WPI and major in being an astronaut, that I had to choose a field.And so because I figured out what my talents and abilities were early on— one of the other things I was drawn to of course was medicine— and I found out that there were physicians who worked in the Space Program. And with that, this deal, my idea, my dreams were set. And so I went off to college.

You’ve heard the education that I had, and then eventually after I finished Mayo Clinic and I ended up at NASA Ames Research Center where I worked on my fellowship. And now with all of that education background, I figured now it’s time for me to turn toward my dreams. And so I applied to the Astronaut Corp in 1987 and I got an invitation to come down there. I interviewed. I spent a week going through that whole process.

I came back feeling really good about myself, that you know what? Everything I’ve worked on to this at this point is going to lead to me becoming an astronaut. And so I waited around for a couple months, sweating— kind of like you probably have in the last week or so, making sure that you have all of your grades in line to graduate today. So I got that call. And that call was not a victory call but it was a disappointing call.

So they said, Bernard, we liked you. The interviewers thought highly of you. But we’re not going to select you this year. And I have to tell you I was devastated. And I remember sitting back after I cried like a baby, sat back and wondered, what am I going to do? I have two options.Option number one was to accept their verdict that I was not astronaut material and caliber and just give up on my dream, or option two was to say, OK, they didn’t select me this time. So maybe I can find a way to increase my skills and my abilities and get more visibility so that they would accept me the next time. And that’s exactly what I did. In 1990, they had another astronaut class and I applied. And I was the first one selected to interview. I was the first one that was selected in my class of 23 as you heard about.

So that little story or vignette reminds me to remind you that sometimes failure is an option. I’m sure that you’ve heard NASA and the call from Apollo 13 when they say, failure is not an option. Well, sometimes failure is an option. Why do I say that? Because that failure allowed me to reassess myself, allowed me to go back and get those skills that were necessary so that I would be more presentable the next time.It allowed me to in fact grow. I believe that you shouldn’t let failure define you, but instead you should let failure refine you. And that’s exactly what I did. And sometimes as a reminder to you that our greatest growth comes when we fail.

So you’re going to be released today after you graduate. You’re going to hit the real world. You’re thinking right now that, you know, I’ve got a degree from WPI and nothing can stop me— and I want you to go out there with that expectation— but you’re going to have failure. And you’ve got to be able to deal with that.

So I dealt with that. I was in the 13th class of the astronaut office. I went through two years of basic training, and then got selected for my first mission in 1993, my second mission in 1995, and it was a glorious, glorious time to be at NASA. Shuttles were flying on time, during that time. It was just unusual these days.And what I’d like to do now is share with you what it’s like to travel in space. You guys ready to go? That didn’t sound very convincing to me. Are you ready to go?

So the first thing I want to remind you of is the shuttle. Right now— and let me back up and explain a couple things, because when people come and they talk to me, they always said, “God, I’m sorry that the Space Program is no longer— you know, we no longer have the Space Program.” Guess what, we still have the Space Program. The only thing that’s happened is that we’ve taken the Shuttle Program and we’ve handed that over to private industry. And now private industry is building the next generation shuttle.

But what I flew was a shuttle— Columbia and Discovery— and it was a remarkable vehicle. That vehicle weighs 5 million pounds. In order to get that 5 million pounds in the air, we have to find engines that produce a thrust of 7.5 million pounds. And I’m here to tell you this afternoon that when those engines light, you are leaving this planet, and nothing’s going to hold you to it. Immediately when they fire, you get pushed back in your seat about two times your weight.

Within about 30 seconds or so, we’re clearing the launch tower and we’re approaching the speed of sound, 750 miles per hour. Within two minutes of lift-off, we reach an altitude of 100,000 feet above the ground, about three times higher than most aircraft fly, and at that point we’re going a mere 2,500 miles an hour. And over the next 6.5 minutes we’ll go from 2,500 miles an hour to 5,000 to 10,000 to 15,000 and eventually to 17,500 miles an hour.Now you might want to know what we’re doing on the inside besides screaming like babies. It’s very rocky. It’s very noisy. You can’t even talk to the person next to as you get pushed back in your seat and you can’t even lift your arm. In fact I remembered— I have all these funny stories.

I know you don’t want to hear me talk too long, but let me kind of share with you one of those stories. On one of my missions— actually it was the first mission— on lift-off just to give you experience of what it’s like on the inside. So we’re in this suit. The suit weighs about 120 pounds.

We’re under this 3.5 G force and I remember we were about 6 minutes into the flight and I went from thinking about what I wanted to do and wanted to prepare— you know, what I need to do in case something was wrong– to looking, recognizing my legs were hurting. I was going, why are my legs hurting? So under this acceleration because I have long legs— you saw that I had to dip down so they could put the rope on me here— my legs were being spread apart by the acceleration. So every now and then my legs would drift apart like this and suddenly I’d have to pull them back together. And then my legs would lift again and I’d have to pull them back together. By the time I got up to orbit, I was exhausted.Why? Because if I had let that continue to go out, I would’ve been embarrassed because the last thing I wanted to do when the Mission Control in Houston wanted me to report in was to say, Houston we’re OK. So— I fixed that problem the next mission. I had our NASA engineers design a Velcro strap and when the technicians put me in my seat and buckled me up, I strapped my knees together and I was able to focus on that next ride.

So just quickly— so you’re in the spacecraft, being pushed back 3.5 G’s, very heavy, very noisy. And once you make it to orbit, the main engines cut off. You go from all of that experience to zero gravity, just like that. And you know you’re in space because everything begins to float.

And it was amazing as I got out of my seat and I saw the checklist float over, and I took my glove off— my glove came off and it floated over in one direction. I took the other one and I threw it at my neighbor, just for effect and all that. I was finally in space and accomplished my dreams.

You know as an astronaut, we do a lot of experiments up in space. I got a chance on my first mission to do over 91 different investigations, on my second one about 45 different investigations. Got a chance to go to the Mir space station, and probably the most remarkable thing I got a chance to do was to do the space walk. This time I donned a suit that weighed 350 pounds, opened a hatch, and walked outside.Now doing a space walk these days is really a misnomer, right, in the sense that we are not going to any planets. We’re simply going to either the space station or working right around the vehicle that we’re in orbit with. And so as I open up the hatch and pull myself out, it was a wonderful experience. I pulled myself along the side of the vehicle until I got into the robotic arm, then I got lifted up on the robotic arm about 35 feet above the payload bay and there I had a wonderful view, the view of my crew members down below.

I would wave back at them as they waved at me through the window. Behind that was this big blue ball of a planet called planet Earth with this blue water and these white swirls of clouds. It was beautiful. And behind that, of course, was a sea of stars called the Milky Way.And I remember after we had done all of our tasks, I was just hanging out— because we had completed everything— and just taking it all in. And I remember feeling this small, in the sense that here I was in this spaceship, going around the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour— and did I fail to mention that at 17,500 miles an hour, we’d go around the world every 90 minutes? We’d get to see a sunset or sunrise every 45 minutes. It’s pretty awesome to be up there.

So during the quiet time I took it all in and felt this big. Because, think about this— the spaceship is just skirting right across the atmosphere. And if there was an alien ship that came by to try to find us, they probably couldn’t locate us because we’d just be a speck on the horizon there.

But suddenly I went from being this small person to being larger than life, with this realization that I was doing something very few people had done before. That I was one of about 350 people who’ve ever gone in space, that I was one of about 70 people that had ever done a space walk. And that I was about 1 in 15 of us who were African-American. And on that mission, I became the first African-American to walk in space. Why? Because of a dream that I had as a kid.

I tell that story to remind me, to remind you how important you are and can be. And so I always share that story with young people. You heard that I have a foundation and our foundation supports K through 12 education programs all over this country, including here. And one of the things that I like to do with the elementary school kids and the middle school, high school kids is to have them repeat a phrase that I think is a very important phrase. It’s that one that I mentioned early on, about being an infinite being with infinite possibilities.And so I would like you to do that. How about that? So I want you to repeat after me if you would. You ready? And just the graduates. The rest of you, you don’t count. At least not today.

So repeat after me— I am an infinite being—

I am an infinite being—

—with infinite possibilities.

—with infinite possibilities.

Now, let me kind of show you how that sounded. It sounded like this— I’m an infinite being with infinite possibilities. Oh, God, is he going to ask me to do that again?

Guess what? I’m not only going to ask you to do that again, but I’m going to ask all the graduates of 2015 to stand up. All right, you ready? Now, I want to rock this tent, so let’s rock this tent. Show me what you got.I am an infinite being—

I am an infinite being—

—with infinite possibilities.

—with infinite possibilities.

So let me tell you what that means. It means that each and every one of you graduates and everybody in this room in attendance today was born multi-potential with the ability to do anything that you want to do in life. It also means that each and every one of you in this room was born multi-talented, meaning that you were born with certain talents and certain skills that are uniquely yours. And of course you can use something else called the brain, which you have done the last four years or five years or six years for some of you. No. And develop other skills that are going to take you further.

And lastly, and I think this is the most important point about being an infinite being with infinite possibilities is that each and every one of you in this room was born for a reason. There is something special that you are supposed to do. And some of you even more than just one, so it’s up to you to figure out what that is. And now you can be seated.

One of my favorite— let’s give them a hand. And in closing, one of my favorite authors is a guy by the name of Emmet Fox. And he says that our heart’s desire is the voice of God and that voice must be obeyed sooner or later. So my charge to you is to go out after this day and find that voice. And I can tell you this, if you find that voice and if you invest the time and the effort that it takes to fulfill that voice, that dream, that ambition that you have, you will change the world. I have no doubt about it.


And you will not only be able to change the world for yourself and change the world for the community around you, but you will make a difference in this world as we know it. I want to thank you so much for letting me be your commencement speaker. I want to thank your parents for being here and helping to support this and congratulations and God bless you all.

Hello class of 2015.

Congratulations! And thank you for that wonderful welcome. And thank you President Bottomly for that wonderful introduction.

I have admired Wellesley—its mission, its story, its successes—for a long time and I thank you very much for inviting me.

You are ridiculously lucky to be graduating from this bastion of excellence and on these beautiful acres.

And if the goddesses and gods of the universe do the right thing, then you will also very soon be the proud alumnae of the college that produced America’s first female president! Go Hillary!

I’m truly, truly happy to be here today, so happy, in fact, that when I found out your class color was yellow, I decided I would wear yellow eye shadow. But on second thoughts, I realized that as much as I admire Wellesley, even yellow eye-shadow was a bit too much of a gesture. So I dug out this yellow—yellowish—headwrap instead.

Speaking of eye shadow, I wasn’t very interested in makeup until I was in my twenties, which is when I began to wear makeup. Because of a man. A loud, unpleasant man. He was one of the guests at a friend’s dinner party. I was also a guest. I was about 23, but people often told me I looked 12. The conversation at dinner was about traditional Igbo culture, about the custom that allows only men to break the kola nut, and the kola nut is a deeply symbolic part of Igbo cosmology.

I argued that it would be better if that honor were based on achievement rather than gender, and he looked at me and said, dismissively, “You don’t know what you are talking about, you’re a small girl.”

I wanted him to disagree with the substance of my argument, but by looking at me, young and female, it was easy for him to dismiss what I said. So I decided to try to look older.

So I thought lipstick might help. And eyeliner.

And I am grateful to that man because I have since come to love makeup, and its wonderful possibilities for temporary transformation.

So, I have not told you this anecdote as a way to illustrate my discovery of gender injustice. If anything, it’s really just an ode to makeup.

It’s really just to say that this, your graduation, is a good time to buy some lipsticks—if makeup is your sort of thing—because a good shade of lipstick can always put you in a slightly better mood on dark days.

It’s not about my discovering gender injustice because of course I had discovered years before then. From childhood. From watching the world.

I already knew that the world does not extend to women the many small courtesies that it extends to men.

I also knew that victimhood is not a virtue. That being discriminated against does not make you somehow morally better.

And I knew that men were not inherently bad or evil. They were merely privileged. And I knew that privilege blinds because it is the nature of privilege to blind.

I knew from this personal experience, from the class privilege I had of growing up in an educated family, that it sometimes blinded me, that I was not always as alert to the nuances of people who were different from me.

And you, because you now have your beautiful Wellesley degree, have become privileged, no matter what your background. That degree, and the experience of being here, is a privilege. Don’t let it blind you too often. Sometimes you will need to push it aside in order to see clearly.

I bring greetings to you from my mother. She’s a big admirer of Wellesley, and she wishes she could be here. She called me yesterday to ask how the speech-writing was going and to tell me to remember to use a lot of lotion on my legs today so they would not look ashy.

My mother is 73 and she retired as the first female registrar of the University of Nigeria—which was quite a big deal at the time.

My mother likes to tell a story of the first university meeting she chaired. It was in a large conference room, and at the head of the table was a sign that said CHAIRMAN. My mother was about to get seated there when a clerk came over and made to remove the sign. All the past meetings had of course been chaired by men, and somebody had forgotten to replace the CHAIRMAN with a new sign that said CHAIRPERSON. The clerk apologized and told her he would find the new sign, since she was not a chairman.

My mother said no. Actually, she said, she WAS a chairman. She wanted the sign left exactly where it was. The meeting was about to begin. She didn’t want anybody to think that what she was doing in that meeting at that time on that day was in any way different from what a CHAIRMAN would have done.

I always liked this story, and admired what I thought of as my mother’s fiercely feminist choice. I once told the story to a friend, a card carrying feminist, and I expected her to say bravo to my mother, but she was troubled by it.

“Why would your mother want to be called a chairman, as though she needed the MAN part to validate her?” my friend asked.

In some ways, I saw my friend’s point.

Because if there were a Standard Handbook published annually by the Secret Society of Certified Feminists, then that handbook would certainly say that a woman should not be called, nor want to be called, a CHAIRMAN.

But gender is always about context and circumstance.

If there is a lesson in this anecdote, apart from just telling you a story about my mother to make her happy that I spoke about her at Wellesley, then it is this: Your standardized ideologies will not always fit your life. Because life is messy.

When I was growing up in Nigeria I was expected, as every student who did well was expected, to become a doctor. Deep down I knew that what I really wanted to do was to write stories. But I did what I was supposed to do and I went into medical school.

I told myself that I would tough it out and become a psychiatrist and that way I could use my patients’ stories for my fiction.

But after one year of medical school I fled. I realized I would be a very unhappy doctor and I really did not want to be responsible for the inadvertent death of my patients. Leaving medical school was a very unusual decision, especially in Nigeria where it is very difficult to get into medical school.

Later, people told me that it had been very courageous of me, but I did not feel courageous at all.

What I felt then was not courage but a desire to make an effort. To try. I could either stay and study something that was not right for me. Or I could try and do something different. I decided to try. I took the American exams and got a scholarship to come to the US where I could study something else that was NOT related to medicine. Now it might not have worked out. I might not have been given an American scholarship.

My writing might not have ended up being successful. But the point is that I tried.

We can not always bend the world into the shapes we want but we can try, we can make a concerted and real and true effort. And you are privileged that, because of your education here, you have already been given many of the tools that you will need to try. Always just try. Because you never know.

And so as you graduate, as you deal with your excitement and your doubts today, I urge you to try and create the world you want to live in.

Minister to the world in a way that can change it. Minister radically in a real, active, practical, get your hands dirty way.

Wellesley will open doors for you. Walk through those doors and make your strides long and firm and sure.

Write television shows in which female strength is not depicted as remarkable but merely normal.

Teach your students to see that vulnerability is a HUMAN rather than a FEMALE trait.

Commission magazine articles that teach men HOW TO KEEP A WOMAN HAPPY. Because there are already too many articles that tell women how to keep a man happy. And in media interviews make sure fathers are asked how they balance family and work. In this age of ‘parenting as guilt,’ please spread the guilt equally. Make fathers feel as bad as mothers. Make fathers share in the glory of guilt.

Campaign and agitate for paid paternity leave everywhere in America.

Hire more women where there are few. But remember that a woman you hire doesn’t have to be exceptionally good. Like a majority of the men who get hired, she just needs to be good enough.

Recently a feminist organization kindly nominated me for an important prize in a country that will remain unnamed. I was very pleased. I’ve been fortunate to have received a few prizes so far and I quite like them especially when they come with shiny presents. To get this prize, I was required to talk about how important a particular European feminist woman writer had been to me. Now the truth was that I had never managed to finish this feminist writer’s book. It did not speak to me. It would have been a lie to claim that she had any major influence on my thinking. The truth is that I learned so much more about feminism from watching the women traders in the market in Nsukka where I grew up, than from reading any seminal feminist text. I could have said that this woman was important to me, and I could have talked the talk, and I could have been given the prize and a shiny present.

But I didn’t.

Because I had begun to ask myself what it really means to wear this FEMINIST label so publicly.

Just as I asked myself after excerpts of my feminism speech were used in a song by a talented musician whom I think some of you might know. I thought it was a very good thing that the word ‘feminist’ would be introduced to a new generation.

But I was startled by how many people, many of whom were academics, saw something troubling, even menacing, in this.

It was as though feminism was supposed to be an elite little cult, with esoteric rites of membership.

But it shouldn’t. Feminism should be an inclusive party. Feminism should be a party full of different feminisms.

And so, class of 2015, please go out there and make Feminism a big raucous inclusive party.

The past three weeks have been the most emotionally difficult of my life. My father is 83 years old, a retired professor of statistics, a lovely kind man. I am an absolute Daddy’s girl. Three weeks ago, he was kidnapped near his home in Nigeria. And for a number of days, my family and I went through the kind of emotional pain that I have never known in my life. We were talking to threatening strangers on the phone, begging and negotiating for my father’s safety and we were not always sure if my father was alive. He was released after we paid a ransom. He is well, in fairly good shape and in his usual lovely way, is very keen to reassure us all that he is fine.

I am still not sleeping well, I still wake up many times at night, in panic, worried that something else has gone wrong, I still cannot look at my father without fighting tears, without feeling this profound relief and gratitude that he is safe, but also rage that he had to undergo such an indignity to his body and to his spirit.

And the experience has made me re-think many things, what truly matters, and what doesn’t. What I value, and what I don’t.

And as you graduate today, I urge you to think about that a little more. Think about what really matters to you. Think about what you WANT to really matter to you.

I read about your rather lovely tradition of referring to older students as “big sisters” and younger ones as “little sisters.” And I read about the rather strange thing about being thrown into the pond—and I didn’t really get that—but I would very much like to be your honorary big sister today.

Which means that I would like to give you bits of advice as your big sister:

All over the world, girls are raised to be make themselves likeable, to twist themselves into shapes that suit other people.

Please do not twist yourself into shapes to please. Don’t do it. If someone likes that version of you, that version of you that is false and holds back, then they actually just like that twisted shape, and not you. And the world is such a gloriously multifaceted, diverse place that there are people in the world who will like you, the real you, as you are.

I am lucky that my writing has given me a platform that I choose to use to talk about things that I care about, and

I have said a few things that have not been so popular with a number of people. I have been told to shut up about certain things – such as my position on the equal rights of gay people on the continent of Africa, such as my deeply held belief that men and women are completely equal. I don’t speak to provoke. I speak because I think our time on earth is short and each moment that we are not our truest selves, each moment we pretend to be what we are not, each moment we say what we do not mean because we imagine that is what somebody wants us to say, then we are wasting our time on earth.

I don’t mean to sound precious but please don’t waste your time on earth, but there is one exception. The only acceptable way of wasting your time on earth is online shopping.

Okay, one last thing about my mother. My mother and I do not agree on many things regarding gender. There are certain things my mother believes a person should do, for the simple reason that said person ‘is a woman.’ Such as nod occasionally and smile even when smiling is the last thing one wants to do. Such as strategically give in to certain arguments, especially when arguing with a non-female. Such as get married and have children. I can think of fairly good reasons for doing any of these. But ‘because you are a woman’ is not one of them. And so, Class of 2015, never ever accept ‘Because You Are A Woman’ as a reason for doing or not doing anything.

And, finally I would like to end with a final note on the most important thing in the world: love.

Now girls are often raised to see love only as giving. Women are praised for their love when that love is an act of giving. But to love is to give AND to take.

Please love by giving and by taking. Give and be given. If you are only giving and not taking, you’ll know. You’ll know from that small and true voice inside you that we females are so often socialized to silence.

Don’t silence that voice. Dare to take.

Congratulations.

UVA is truly a magical place founded by the great Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.  I'm being told , no, that is not N.W.A., not UVA.  Apologies.    My bad.   Your founder, of course, is the great Thomas Jefferson who wrote that he hoped the University would attract talented students from other states to come and "drink of the cup of knowledge" and students were like you had me at drink.  
 
As would be expected from an institution of this caliber, UVA has its share of famous and highly successful alumni including Tina Fey, Edgar Allan Poe and New York Jets offensive lineman D'Brickashaw Ferguson which brings the question--what do Tina Fey, Edgar Allan Poe and D'Brickshaw Ferguson have in common actually has an answer.  I did not know that.    
 
It is such a treat to be addressing you in front of the famous UVA Rotunda which is now undergoing its fourth complete overhaul since its inception, making it the Rand Paul of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  The best thing about Virginia is, of course, your state motto--Virginia is for Lovers, which explains why the mottos of Maryland and West Virginia and North Carolina are all get a room.   
 
When I was invited to speak to you today, it was pretty obvious to me what was going on, so I'm not going to stand here with false modesty and pretend I don’t know the real reason I'm here.  I get it.  This is Virginia and I play the banjo.   I grew up here in the South and yet despite having many friends who attended this great institution, you might be surprised to know that my strongest tie to UVA is actually through show business.  I was an actor on a sit com called "The Office" for many years and in one episode, my a cappella-obsessed character Andy Bernand brought his own college a cappella group to Dunder Mifflin.  This group was played by none other than your very own Virginia Hullabahoos.   And we had a great time working together.  
 
Now, here's a slightly less well known factoid.  The wardrobe for Andy Bernard was actually inspired by student attire at the Foxfield Races.  An interesting side note--Andy Bernard was also supposed to appear in one season of "The Office" and then they were going to get rid of him.  But I'm proud to say due to the character's popularity, they decided to bring him back which is why I feel a special kinship with President Sullivan who can best be described-- I think we can all agree, President Sullivan can best be described as the Andy Bernard of UVA, although I will point out Andy Bernard was eventually canceled along with the rest of the show, so don't get too cocky.  
 
I don't know if you're even aware of this, but UVA has had quite an impact on Hollywood recently.  It turns out that orange and blue are the new black.  And the Virginia ABC officers were the inspirations for the Paul Blart "Mall Cop" movies.  
 
A lot of people think it's strange that a school with 21,000 students should have close to 15,000 secret societies, but I think it's fabulous.  As a Free Mason and Templar Knight and member of the Illuminati, I feel very at home here.  Incidentally, last night I either joined a Secret Society or I'm now legally married to a goat in a purple hood.  One of my favorite UVA traditions is, of course, streaking which I learned the hard way does not include attending the Boar's Head Inn continental breakfast arbitrarily nude, a mistake I will not be making again or will I? 
 
Congratulations to the men's soccer team, national champions for seventh year in a row,  a great sports tradition here at UVA, although I've got to be honest. I feel like we could work on your mascot a little.  You're the Cavaliers and yet your mascot doesn't have a very Cavalier expression.  I mean you can't expect fans to leap to their feet and cheer when the mascot looks artsy and world-weary like an emo Captain Morgan living paycheck to paycheck until his jam band makes it big.  
 
Tomorrow, having worn the Honors of Honor, whatever the hell that is, you will walk away from this University carrying with you invaluable knowledge and experience, and if you're lucky, the password to your roommate's Netflix account.   You will also have your esteemed UVA diploma which I understand is absurdly large, one-and-one-half by two feet to be exact.  What in God's name are you compensating for and where will you hang that?  It's basically a highway billboard advertising unemployment and crippling student loan debt.  The good news is for those of you who majored in comparative literature, your diploma can also serve as a tent for you to live under.   
 
But enough about you?  What about me, right?  Why'm I here?  Well, I'm speaking to you today because I'm a very brilliant and important person.  How do I know this? Well, because I'm a celebrity and celebrities are by definition brilliant and important, according to my agent.  And, of course, also deeply humble according to my publicist.  But I'd like to set the record straight because I feel that celebrities are often misunderstood.  For example, people often try to define me as callous and pampered, living in a bubble.  Ha.  I'm very resentful of this because I'm actually extremely grounded which is why I have my vast legal team crush every last person who would say otherwise.  The simple truth is that celebrities are people, too.  I have my pants put on me one leg at a time just like everyone else.  And I deal with my feelings the same way you do--by burying them deep inside under gallons of Ben & Jerry's while scrolling through Netflix titles never quite committing to watching anything.  Those are some ways people try to define me.  
 
Here are some ways that people are trying to define you.  You are millennials which is the biggest generation in U.S. history.  I thought it was hard for me to find a job.  It's going to be like "The Hunger Games" out there for you guys.  They say millennials are uninterested in the burden of ownership and prefer to be part of the sharing economy, that you're exercising more, eating right and using apps and data to track your health.  They say you use built-in sonar to see in the dark and that your wings have tiny glands that produce a tawny, almost tobacco-like musk when you're frightened.   Some of these labels might fit.  Others seem like they might apply more to bats, the last one in particular, but at best, these generation descriptors are just an absurd reduction, so take note, as you go out in the world, you'll find that people are always quick to define you, to pigeonhole you, to whittle you down to their preconceived notions which brings me to my point.  Never let others define you.  Define yourselves.  
 
In 1997, Apple Computers was seen as well past its peak and the prognosis was dire.  In October of that year, Dell Computers CEO Michael Dell was asked what would you do if you were Steve Jobs.  He said, what would I do? I'd shut Apple down and give the money back to the shareholders.  Well, do me a favor, reach into your pocket and take out your Dell phones and tweet that. 
 
In 1991, I was applying to colleges and my father suggested Vanderbilt.  After all, he had gone there.  So had my mom.  It's a great school and maybe after that I could go to law school just like he did and then join a law firm in Atlanta.  Wouldn't that be great? Well, no.  Not really, because my idea of being a lawyer is being in a John Grisham movie.  This was a major crossroads for me, a moment where I needed to define myself and thank God, I did.  I decided to attend a smart artsy school, Oberlin College in Ohio where I joined up with some bluegrass pickers and some impromptu comedy nerds and those two things have shaped my life more than just about anything else.  
 
In 2008, I'd spent close to five wonderful years on "The Daily Show" as a fake new correspondent.  I wanted to act more, to do other things, but the TV community had already defined me.  He's not an actor, he just does fake news, so I threw myself into a short film a friend was putting together and we worked our asses off on it.  When that film landed on "The Office" Greg Daniels' desk, he saw me on my terms and suddenly I was in consideration for one my favorite TV shows.  
 
Now, I know the UVA community has some experience with being defined by outsiders.  It has been said that a rolling stone gathers no moss.  I would add that sometimes a rolling stone also gathers no verifiable facts or even the tiniest morsels of journalistic integrity.   "Rolling Stone" tried to define you this year.  As a result, not only was this community thrown deep into turmoil, but the incredibly important struggle to address sexual violence on campuses nationwide was suddenly more confusing than ever and needlessly set back.  And sadly, "Rolling Stone's" rush to define is just the tip of the iceberg.  We see it everywhere in the media.  Less than three weeks ago when Baltimore was erupting in violence, Erin Burnett on CNN argued with a local resident insisting the rioters be defined as thugs.  Wolf Blitzer did the same thing.  Over on Fox News, reporter Nick Vittert prattled on about how violent the people of Baltimore were, but City Councilman Nick Mosby wouldn't have it.  In a testy exchange he defined his own community saying, "this is about the social economics of poor urban America.  These young guys are frustrated, they're upset and unfortunately they're displaying it in a very destructive manner.  When folks are undereducated, unfortunately they don't have the same intellectual voice to express it in the way other people do and that's what we see through the violence today."  That's a much bigger, more complex analysis and it strikes me as the real news story.  Either way, the reductive labels aren't helping and we better stop applying them because there're a lot of Americans in a lot of pain.  Those riots weren't happening in Kiev or Benghazi.  They happened a mighty pleasant 3-hour drive from right here.  So does all of this mean that Erin Burnett and Wolf Blitzer are bad people?  I don't think so.  We're all guilty of this.  
 
How many times do we label someone with our first impressions only to be proven wrong?  The tattooed motorcycle guy who turns out to be a teddy bear.  The buttoned-up coworker who actually knows how to party or the mousy librarian who takes off her glasses to reveal she's a blood-thirsty alien from a distant galaxy.   We try to define others with simple labels because it makes the world easier to understand.  Behavioral economist and Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman explained this in his amazing book, "Thinking Fast and Slow" in which he wrote "when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution."  So clearly, other people are really bad at defining us.  
 
But sometimes these can also be great opportunities to examine and learn about ourselves. This may sound contradictory, but F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function and that's precisely what all of you did.  This community didn't fall for the fallacy that just because "Rolling Stone" was wrong everything here must be perfectly peachy.  You all had the courage to understand you can be outraged at "Rolling Stone" and still ask yourselves some hard questions.  When sexual violence does occur in our community, do we have the best possible protocols and resources available to our students.  And UVA is charging forward to answer those questions and you should be proud of that.   
 
Questioning something doesn't mean you repudiate it.  To the contrary, we should question most of the ideas and institutions we cherish the most.  We can question a sitting president without disrespecting the office.  We can question our foreign policy while still supporting our troops.  We can celebrate the honor and courage of our dedicated police while questioning some of their tactics and, of course, we can love our parents and respect their desires while charting our own courses.  Sorry, moms and dads, but maybe that's a good one for you to hear, too.  It doesn't matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum.  What matters is that you approach the world with humility, intellectual honesty, and an ongoing effort to understand the whole picture.  
 
If you need any more reason to be humble, there's a terrifying new study out by Yale law professor Dan Kahan and his colleagues that paints a very scary picture of how our minds work.  I suggest looking it up, but the gist of it is that very smart people are confounded by very simple math problems when the results of the math problem challenge their politics.  In other words, our beliefs make us irrational.  Many of our most brilliant thinkers have had shocking blind spots, spaces where they chose to ignore what was right in front of them.  Our Founding Fathers were obsessed with liberty, and yet at the same time they owned slaves.  We can marvel at how blind they were but maybe we should also ask ourselves where are our blind spots today, which of our positions will look equally absurd to generations to come.  What are we rationalizing or refusing to see? 
 
In "You're Not So Smart," author David McRaney points out that "there is a growing body of work coming out of psychology and cognitive science that says you have no clue why you act the way you do, chose the things you chose, or think the thoughts you think.  That is terrifying.  Apparently, we fight to stay idiots because the  more we know and understand, the more we realize the world is just a confounding, infuriating place.  So what now?  Do we give up? Give into nihilistic defeatism? Just throw our hands up in despair and say oh, well, I guess I'm an idiot and the world's a mess, time for some Ben &Jerry's and Netflix?  Hell, no.  
 
Realize that this is a wonderful gift of greater self-awareness and self-knowledge.  It's not depressing.  It's liberating.  Pain, suffering and ignorance make no sense, but guess what?  Neither do beauty, compassion and love.  They're two halves of the same pomegranate and whichever side you decide to chomp down on will define who you are.  Remember what F. Scott Fitzgerald said. Apparently Georgia Tech doesn't like this speech.  Where were we?  I was really building momentum, wasn't I?   
 
Oh, yes, the pomegranate.  There're two halves of the same pomegranate and whichever side you decide to chomp down on will define who you are.  Remember what F. Scott Fitzgerald said.  Well, this is the mother of all opposing ideas for you to hold in your head at the same time and still function.  
 
Here are a few more.  The world is not a meritocracy, but merit still matters.  The world isn't fair, but being fair still matters.  The world is unkind, but being kind still matters, perhaps more than anything.  We can't eliminate human nature from humanity, so we must embrace it.  Accept ourselves, the good, the bad, our brilliance, and our ignorance and simply strive to improve.  
 
David Brooks in a wonderful "New York Times" column titled "The Moral Bucket List" referred to this process as stumbling.  He said, "the stumbler doesn't build her life by being better than others, but by being better than she used to be." Ernest Hemingway put it another way:  there is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men.  True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.  Even Matthew McConaughey weighed in on this. In his Oscar acceptance speech for "Dallas Buyer's Club," he said a person came to me and said, 'who's your hero?" and I said, it's me in 10 years.'"  Now, the media had a field day with this.  They said he's his own hero, what a narcissist, but own hero, but that's way off base.  That's actually a beautiful idea.  He was defining who he wanted to be and then chasing after it.  
 
My compliments to Marco Rubio.  Now, after digging deep, I realized that the person I really wanted to be is Matthew McConaughey.   Hey, I mean, come on.  That Texas charisma just washes over you like warm pancake syrup.  Who do you want to be? You are going to be defined whether you like it or not.  The question is will you let others do it for you or will you define yourselves.  And remember, you can't just define yourselves with words.  You can't write it in a journal or say it out loud--I am a wonderful person with exceptional character and a vaguely British accent.  No, that does not cut it.  We define ourselves by our actions, convictions, and responses to the world around us and by the degree to which we take full responsibility for our lives.  
 
Now, whatever your backgrounds and wherever you're headed, you all have two things in common right now:  you are graduating with a phenomenal education and you are young.  These two things combined give you immense power.  They say with great power comes great responsibility.  Not true.  Responsibility is entirely optional.  You can coast if you want to but don't you dare coast.  Ladies and gentlemen of the University of Virginia class of 2015, each and every one of you has a vibrant, courageous soul and a depth of power, creativity and wisdom you are only just beginning to tap into.  That is your light.  It is the light within you and you have to let it shine because when you do, I promise it will illuminate you, your family, your friends, your community, your country, and the entire world.  Don't let that light die.  Every day, wake up and say to yourself, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.    
 
This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.  Everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine.  Whoa, everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine.  Everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.  Little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  Oh, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.  I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.  I'm going to let it shine.  Congratulations.

Thank you, Chancellor Folt, Graduates, President Tom Ross, members of the faculty and members of the Board of Trustees. Thank you for the very kind welcome. It is an honor to address and to congratulate the graduating class of 2015.

As Chancellor Folt covered beautifully earlier in the ceremony, today is Mother’s Day. None of this would be happening today if not for your mothers’ love…and the estimated 51,932 hours of labor that was required collectively of your mothers to bring your graduating class’s smiling faces into this world. Thank you Moms!

This is a spectacular day in your lives, one that will prove to be among the most memorable of life’s mileposts. I’m particularly excited to be here today, given that I too went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My freshman year I lived in the architectural triumph that is Hinton James Dorm. I am a product of the Kenan-Flagler Business School, in addition to UNC’s School of Journalism & Mass Communication (soon to be rebranded as the UNC School of Media & Journalism in what I think is a wonderful moment of change for the school). It has been an absolute pleasure to be back on campus this weekend and to be welcomed by Chancellor Folt with a southern hospitality that can be found nowhere else on Earth. Y’all have been mighty kind.

This year, rather than choosing from any number of Nobel Prize laureates or political luminaries to be your Commencement Speaker, you having chosen me, the guy best known for making it easier to watch recent episodes of “South Park” and “Family Guy.” Assuming there were no jedi mind tricks at play here…it’s clear to me that you have chutzpah and moxie! That will serve you well in life.

I’d like to share some of my story with you this morning. I share it in the hope that you may find some benefit. It is a story of dreams, failure & loss, perseverance and one unfortunate run-in with the authorities in southern California. In any event, my story goes something like this:

In 1993, I sat in the same bleachers you currently find yourselves in, adorned in my Carolina blue graduation gown, excited to graduate. My mother and father were there, enjoying the glorious pageantry of it all. That day, my parents got to meet the girl that I began dating months earlier (a junior at UNC). Perhaps you are experiencing similar family moments this weekend on campus and on Franklin Street. Life was pretty good.

In the months PRIOR to my graduation, I did everything I could to land a job in the middle of the Hollywood machinery. My dream, dating back to when I was a kid, was to follow in the footsteps of Walt Disney. I had always been fascinated by stories well told and how Disney leveraged technology in the interest of making them better. For most of my Senior year, I wrote to every executive I could in Hollywood. The sum total of 5 months of letter-writing and phone-calling was a cavalcade of no’s, if I was lucky to get a reply, and one informational interview for a movie production. The informational interview was to be conducted at Universal Studios in Los Angeles a few days after my graduation. I wasn’t exactly off to a great start, but I was hopeful things would improve.

Soon after my graduation ceremony ended on that Sunday in Kenan Stadium, I kissed my girlfriend goodbye and gave big hugs to my mother and father. I made the cross-country drive in my 1982 Subaru in record time, trying to make an impact in Los Angeles by doing something that I loved.

This is where the story veers from the expected — and the first I’ve shared it. A day after arriving in Los Angeles – and on the heels of my informational interview at Universal Studios – my Mom tearfully but bravely shared the news over the phone that my Dad had taken his life. He was 47. Kind, loving husband of 27 years. Proud and wonderful father of six children. Accomplished professional, having put himself through school, earning three degrees. The man I admired most — who taught me so much — was gone from this world, three days after I last saw him, in this very stadium.

Things went poorly in the weeks and months after. The movie production job didn’t work out the way I had hoped; I was hired but soon let go. This was also the time when I learned — with the help of the Northridge, California police department — that the Cal State-Northridge parking deck was not looking to welcome recent college graduates living out of their Subaru hatchbacks each night. I soon found myself working for a temp agency back home on the East coast, installing shelving at a TJ Maxx that was undergoing renovation. I was personally lost, and professionally about as far from my dreams as one could be.

I mention this part of my story because I want you all to know that, in your own moments of personal and professional adversity that are sure to come, you will not be alone. Everyone in this stadium, everyone in this world, has struggled with and will struggle with personal losses and professional failures. Adversity is a necessary and important part of life. Adversity strengthens each of us in ways that success cannot. The mountain peaks of one’s life may get the headlines and the Facebook posts, but the valleys — believe me — it is your journey through the valleys that will define you.

Back when my Dad died, I took a cue from how my Mom had always persevered through adversity. For 30 years, she helped my Dad successfully battle manic-depressive disorder, and in that noble and successful fight, she chose to face adversity with courage, with kindness, and with optimism. I picked myself up eventually that summer of 1993, making an important observation along the way: when things get tough, I believe that we as a species surprise ourselves with how much strength we have deep within, strength that we may never have previously known or been aware we had. In the most trying times, in unimaginable circumstances, that well of strength can be drawn on. We find that we can persevere. You can persevere.

This leads me to the second part of my story, a story about doing what you love, about taking risks, and never stopping.

I will be the first to admit that my career is not for most people and has been filled with unusual moments of taking risk. I got my first real job at The Walt Disney Company by drawing myself into a comic strip rather than sending a resume. Upon graduating from Business School in 1997 with a debt level that approximated Slovenia’s gross domestic product, I jumped into a modestly-salaried role at a relatively small private company in the Pacific Northwest that was trying to sell stuff over the internet. About that internet company: my friends and family thought I was insane to go there, given the uncertainty and the traditional opportunities that I would be forgoing. But I was intoxicated by a very simple thing that company offered: the chance to innovate, to build a better way. This was a mission, not a job. Yes, there was risk and yes, the company could have ended belly up as many early-stage companies do. But it didn’t. The small company I joined was called Amazon. And I was able to learn for 9 years from one of the finest leaders of our time in Jeff Bezos. I took a risk to do something that I passionately believed in, and am very glad I did.

Doing what you love, pursuing your own path, is often the most unsettling option at the outset. The paths that others have traveled before you. Those are the paths that have greater visibility, they appear lower risk, they play better in conversations with the Aunts, Uncles, and neighbors. But don’t fall for it. You are better than that and have the strength to go your own way. Remember, I know that each of you has moxie and chutzpah by the bucketloads.

I made the decision in 2007 to jump into a new chapter…this time to build a team from day one and to help build a company with a mission to re-imagine how television programming was delivered. We decided to call the company Hulu. In the early days ahead of Hulu’s launch, both the company and my decision to lead and help build it, were very publicly considered truly horrible, awful ideas. We were called ClownCo by the smartest people in Silicon Valley. A digital counter even ran on one of the tech industry’s most respected websites to track how many days it was going to take for the company to implode. The early days of Hulu were among the toughest in my career. I kept reminding myself of that phrase attributed to Winston Churchill: “When you are going through Hell, keep going.”

But here’s the thing that I can’t emphasize enough for all of you: most people you run into in life — including the smart ones — will be averse to new things. They certainly were in my experience in the early days of Amazon and Hulu. The typical human response in the face of the new is to ignore, mock or dismiss it. New is scary. New is the unknown. Most everyone does not believe that the new will work…until it does.

If you think the world is broken in a certain way and you have a great new idea to fix it, do yourself a favor and pursue your convictions, relentlessly. The path I describe will be an uncertain one. But don’t let the fear of uncertainty, of not having all the answers, be the thing that holds you back from pursuing your dreams. At your age, it is natural to have so many questions: who will I be? What do I want to do? Where should I live? What makes me happy? It’s easy to feel alone in this uncertainty, to feel bad that you don’t have these details figured out (even though it seems like your friends do). As you get older, you realize that no one has all the answers. It turns out that life is an exercise in living with the certainty of uncertainty.

Hulu ended up working out. Consumers were ready for a new way to enjoy their favorite TV programs. None of this would have happened in my career had I not chosen to ignore the conventional wisdom and pursue what I loved, taking considered risks along the way. And when I found myself going through hell, to keep going.

Before I finish, and let you get back to watching Family Guy on Hulu, I’d like to bring things full circle, back here, to Kenan Stadium. The girl from Carolina – the one from my own graduation that I mentioned at the start – well, she is actually here again today…and she has four small humans in her wake that keep referring to me as their father. I love you Jamie more than you could know. My mother also happens to be here today in this special stadium, taking in the glorious pageantry once more, and inspiring me each day with her choices of courage, kindness, and optimism.

And so…now…graduating class of 2015, your adventure begins. My wish is that you make it the most epic of adventures possible. Dream. Dream big. Take the risk. Fail. Pick yourself back up again. And always, always remember this: There is no adversity capable of stopping you once the choice to persevere is made.

It has been a true honor and the highest of privileges to address you this morning. I am rooting for each and every one of you. Congratulations and thank you.

Let me start by speaking very personally. I envy you all.

You are graduating and starting the next phase of your life at an amazing time.

The tools you have been exposed to, the knowledge and skills your have picked up through hard work and play, the networks you have woven for yourselves empower you to do amazing things IF, that is, you are willing to exercise your imagination; and to invoke the social networks you have built to enroll others in the future you are forging for yourselves, for your families, for Arizona and for the world.

You are transitioning from being a student to being an entrepreneurial learner – a learner who is skilled at learning with and from your interactions with the world and with others. You will be engaged in quests where you will draw on known resources all around you but you will also need to discover hidden resources to help you do what others might think impossible.

You live in the networked age powered by digital technologies that drive an exponentially expanding knowledge base and connect a diverse, globalized world. Yes, these are amazing times.

I also started my career at an amazing time – the beginning of the digital revolution; yes, a few decades ago. I found my way to Xerox PARC – Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center

At PARC we were charged to imagine new ways to build and design, new ways to communicate and new ways to collaborate -- all focused on inventing the future of work.

Our mantra - Invent what you need but always use whatever you invent – no paper tigers were allowed.

For me, I felt like a kid in a candy store. Imagination and collaborative invention were the coins of the realm.

We invented much of what we, today, take for granted.

The spelling checker – without which I would have died;

The Personal computer and distributed workstations;

The graphical user interface, that is, the world of icons, with a point, click and drag motif brilliantly commercialized by Apple;

Smalltalk – a major advance in object oriented programing;

The EtherNet and around that local, distributed computing; Laser Printing (which paid for our keep, so to speak);

Social Computing;

Ubiquitous Computing;

And, less well known, we radically expanded the role of ethnography in crafting a scientific base for user centered design.

Yes, in a way, it felt like a Cambrian Explosion where a new life form was starting to emerge.

I say all this today because you are at the threshold of yet another Cambrian Explosion – part of which is technical and another critical part is social & institutional.

On the technical side you know the litany.

Social media, Big Data, Mobile First, information visualization, machine learning and, of course, cloud computing.

In fact, the computational powers you have at your fingertips are now more than 10,000 times greater than what I first experienced.

And just consider that the capabilities of 3D printing, a foreign concept just a few years ago, are now saving the lives of babies whose trachea and bronchial passages have collapsed. To me, that is simply amazing.

On the social and institutional side of this new Cambrian Explosion you – here at ASU – are probably the first class to have experienced the full potential of uniquely crafted learning trajectories through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques used, in some of your courses, to optimally select and present new learning experiences and challenges to work on. In your labs and maker spaces you have had the chance to learn-by-doing --- knowledge in action engaging both head and hand!

You have experienced here the New American University aimed at creating new kinds of transdisciplinary learning environments and knowledge creation spaces that have cultivated your imagination as entrepreneurial learners in the network age.

(Thank you, Michael Crow, for having the imagination, skill and courage to show America that higher education can seriously innovate and strive for excellence for the benefit of all social economic groups.)

But what characterizes the career trajectories you, today, are embarking on?

For my parents, the typical career trajectory was like a steamship. They set course, fired up the engines, and powered ahead. Useful, in the industrial age, but probably not - today.

For your parents, sitting here today - and for me – our career trajectories have been navigated more like a sailboat.

We set course, and through skillful tacking and maneuvering, we've played the winds and currents to get where we thought we wanted to go. Blown off course sometimes, it is still a well-crafted trajectory.

But for you all, today.. the environment is radically different! The way I see your world is this:You are in the living in a white water world.

You must be more like a white water kayaker who skillfully reads the currents and disruptions of the context around you.

You interpret the surface ripples for what it reveals about what lies beneath the water. You operate with both body and head, living totally in the moment using all your senses – sight, sound, touch and force feedback from the paddles – sensing all the time how the environment is responding to you.

You might even say you are having a conversation with the flow. Not like other conversations, it is a conversation that feels for the flow of information passing all around you.

Yes, this is a different world – a world with powerful tools galore and immense opportunities IF you are willing to unleash your imagination and invoke your skills.

Indeed, the whitewater kayaking metaphor calls forth for me a set of quotes, quotes that help orient me in these whitewater times.

The first concerns the keys to innovation: "thus, the task is not so much to see what no one yet as seen but to think what nobody yet has thought about that which everybody sees" by Arthur Schopenhauer – who died in 1860 but a quote that is, perhaps, even more important today than back then.

Just consider, for example Uber! – a company that was just valued at 50 billion dollars.

The second concerns the authentic role of technology "the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."

This was said by Mark Weiser, the founder of the ubiquitous computing movement and a close colleague of mine, before he died of cancer at a too early age.

Third. And from the Imitation Game – the recent film about Alan Turing: "Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of – who will do the things that no one can imagine". Beautifully said by Turing..(or at least by Benedict Cumberbatch in the movie).

And finally, let me end my talk this evening with the quote I try to live by in today's world of extreme information overload:

John Ruskin, On Seeing Clearly, said:

The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think but thousands can think for one who can see! To see clearly is poetry, prophecy and possibility – all in one.

And the possibilities are endlessly yours!!

Thank you and may you all have a prosperous life that builds on the skills and values you have acquired here.

Heartfelt thanks to Chancellor Syverud and the whole Syracuse community, especially our students and their families. You’re all 18 minutes away from my shutting up.

When I told my pal Dooney I was getting an honorary doctorate he quipped, ‘Being a doctor who can’t write prescriptions is like being a general in the Salvation Army.’ This made me a few notches less terrified about today.

Which is how poetry works. You start in a scared place and get ziplined somewhere truer.

The real purpose of poetry, W.H. Auden said, is disenchantment. Not to throw fairy dust in somebody’s eyes; it’s stripping away what’s false so you can see what’s true underneath. I like to say poetry has to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.

So I’ll start with a Mother’s Day poem for all the proud mamas out there, after decades of food prep and butt wiping, it’s your day.

I hope … yeah, let’s give … Go mamas. Magnificent job out there, mamas. And single dads playing mama, you too. And dads.

I remember my own son reaching the age of 16 and driving away in my car, and honest to God, hand to heart, the day he drove away had I seen a giraffe leave our driveway driving my vehicle I would have been more confident that I’d see the giraffe in the vehicle again.

This poem is about that day. It’s called ‘A Blessing for My 16 Years Son.’

I have this son who assembled inside me during hurricane Gloria. In a flash he appeared. In a tiny blaze.

Outside pines were toppling.

Inside, he was a raw pearl, microscopic, luminous. Look at the muscled obelisk of him now, pawing through the icebox for more grapes.
16 years and not a bone broken, not a single stitch.

By his age I was marked more ways and small.

He’s a slouching 6-foot-two with implausible blue eyes which settle on the pages of Emerson’s ‘Self Reliance’ with profound belligerence. A girl with a navel ring could make his cell phone buzz, or an afroed boy leaning on a mop at Taco Bell. His friends are strange to me as dragons or eels.

Balanced on my kitchen stool, each one gives him his advice.

Antoine claims school is ‘harshing my mellow.’

Joe longs to date a tattooed girl because he wants a woman willing to do stuff she’ll regret.

They come to lead my son into his broadening spiral. Someday soon the tether will snap.

I birthed my own mom into oblivion.

The night my son smashed the car fender and rode home in the rain-streaked cop cruiser he asked, ‘Did you and dad screw up this much?’

He let me tuck him in, my grandmother’s wedding quilt from 1912 drawn up to his goateed chin. Don’t blame us, I said, you’re your own idiot now.

At which he grinned.

The cop said the girl in the crimped Chevy took it hard. He found my son awkwardly holding her in the canted headlights, where he draped his own coat over her shaking shoulders. My fault, he confessed right off.

Nice kid said the cop.

Thank you for loaning us all your nice kids.

And kids, thanks for being here. A University is a city of ideas, and we’re grateful that you became citizens of our city.

Whether your degree is in architecture or exercise physiology, law or mathematics, by being here you’ve added something to the conversation this city runs on, the way a body runs on breath.

In the words of a great mathematician, G.H. Hardy, what you’ve added differs in degree only, and not in kind, from the contributions of all the great artists and all the great thinkers and doers, from Shakespeare to Toni Morrison, Einstein to Carmello.

Each of you is a spark that’s added something to our little flame.

And I’m not just talking to the A makers, the valedictorians, salutatorians. I’m addressing the squeakers, the people that showed up today as if sliding into a base, maybe dragging a few incompletes behind you.

Good for you! You made it!

I hope you all learned what you came here for and what you didn’t.

If you’re lucky, you fell in love here. And if you’re really lucky, you had your heart broken.
Because that made you a deeper person and maybe forced you to find friends to lean on. Syracuse is now your alma mater, your soul’s mother, and mine.

I started out as a squeaker myself.

Yet for 30 years I’ve taught in college classrooms, and I promise, the harder you were to work with the more you taught me and your fellows about the human heart. Also for 30 years, I’ve been afraid of not having a Ph.D. Now, the prospect of getting one has turned into the most successful, gut-wrenching weight loss program in history.

That’s how fear works though, isn’t it? Getting what you want can often scare you more than not getting it.

As a young grad student I worried like hell that I looked like a bimbo. Now that I’m an old maid schoolteacher I worry that I don’t.

My point being almost every time I was super afraid it was of the wrong thing. And stuff that first looked like the worst, most humiliating thing that could ever happen almost always led me to something extraordinary and very fine.

So on this day of celebration and hope, I want to do the poet’s glum bunny thing of bringing up that deep, soul-destroying fear and suffering that plague every human life. And I want to pass on a few tricks I’ve learned at such times, for I am an expert in fear.

For the vast majority of my life I had an anxiety disorder big as this stadium. I know I look like a calm, educated white woman. But believe me, I grew up kind of hard.

In a swampy corner of east Texas where the only bookstore sold little day-glo religious figures and there were no books in sight. Of the six drug-dealing friends I moved to California with in my mid-teens, you can’t say we ran away, because when you run away they come looking for you.

Of those six friends, four went to the pen, two of those were dead by 20, another HIV positive, another in the witness protection program.

The drugs we all did back then that didn’t scare me a bit should have. They looked like the solution. For me they were the problem.

What turned me to drugs I believe is partly a genetic gift from my family. I’m Irish and Native American.

But I also grew up in a chaotic household where everybody was opinionated and because it was Texas, well-armed.

My much-loved oil worker daddy suffered a stroke and lay paralyzed for five years.
My mother married seven times. During a psychotic break she once tried to kill me and my sister with a butcher knife. I ran into pedophiles twice as a child.

Mine was not a childhood people wished for.

But I am not a poor thing or Dickensian orphan. I adored my gambler daddy who taught me all the probabilities on a game of craps, and who had in his wallet on the day of his stroke my first published poem.

And my beautiful outlaw mother read books the way junkies shoot dope, plus she got sober at 60 and showed me how to follow.

In a key family anecdote, the guy redoing my mother’s kitchen held up a tile with a perfect round hole in the middle and said to my then 70-year-old fluffy-headed mother, ‘Now, Ms. Karr, this looks like a bullet hole.’

And my sister said, ‘Isn’t that where you shot at daddy?’

And mother didn’t miss a beat. She said, ‘No, that’s where I shot at Larry. Over there is where I shot at your daddy.’

Which is funny as hell if it’s not your mother.

But pretty much every literary project I have taken on in the past 40 years grows directly out of what she and my daddy taught me. So was being their daughter good for me or bad for me?

I wouldn’t have had it any other way.

One of the hardest jobs I ever had was trekking crawfish, which I had to do to pay my grad school tuition. Try to imagine the sucking sounds that a 40-pound bag crustacean makes or the smell of them as I sat on the side of the road trying to keep them alive with wet burlap in 100-degree heat.

If I hadn’t wanted to study poetry I wouldn’t have had to truck crawfish. But poetry has buttered my biscuit. So is it good for me or bad for me?

I practically started my academic career at the lowest point in my life. I checked into a mental institution for what they called suicidal ideation. While I was still in what they call custodial care, I got a fellowship to Radcliffe College. In fact, I had to get a day pass for the first tea, and what scared me that day was that somebody might spy under my sleeve the little plastic wrist bracelet that marked me as a mental patient.

Everybody else was sipping sherry and talking about ideas and I spent the whole day in the corner holding my wrist.

But that stay in the mental Marriott, as I called it, wasn’t the end of my life, it was the beginning. It’s where I finally heard enough to ask for help. It’s where I learned that as deep as a wound is, that’s how deep the healing can be. And since this is America, where cash is king, I made enough telling the story of that place to buy a New York apartment and cover my own kid’s college tuition.

So was it a nervous breakdown or a nervous breakthrough?

Bad things are going to happen to y’all because they happen to us all, and worrying about them won’t stave them off. Look around at each other. This is a good-looking crowd.

I’m telling you, y’all look sharp today!

But at certain times don’t make the mistake of comparing your twisted up insides to other people’s blow dried outsides. The most privileged person in this Dome suffers the torments of the damned just going about the business of being human.

People they adore have been shot through the heart, they’ve suffered agonizing infirmities and even the best families, loved ones, however inadvertently, fail to show up at the key moment or they show up serving grief and shame when tenderness is starved for.

As far as I can tell, a dysfunctional family is any family with more than one person in it.

Even at a celebration like this you might feel simmering inside you some low level fear about not getting the right job or apartment or roommate or partner, and your parents are scared too that you’ll land back on that couch.

When I was young and troubled, I thought feeling better would only happen when I found enough people to love me, but it turns out finding people to love and do for is way more healing.

And that’s what Syracuse has given me.
The opposite of love isn’t hate. It isn’t even indifference. It’s fear.

Often fear of the very pain and suffering that we all know is inevitable. Every major religion tells you the solution to your fear is loving other people and they’re not wrong, but they don’t talk that much about how truly nervewracking everybody is.

The people sucking up your subway air or getting your job or stealing your boyfriend or just standing ahead of you in Starbucks–the fear and rage and resentment you feel for them or even for yourself can choke your heart.

Fear can take that expensively educated brain of yours and reduce it to the state of a dog crouched over a bone. You know the moments, heart pounding in your ears, sweat bumping down your ribs. Ask yourself at those times, who’s noticing how scared you are.

To me it’s this watcher, or noticer self, that’s who I think you really are.
That’s where your soul is.
That’s where God comes in.
That’s a place you can draw strength from.

And if I could, I would download into all your brains today a hard-wired app that would permit you to observe your own rage and fear from inside that quiet, noticer place, to install a button you could push during the bad times and have somebody say in a really convincing voice, this might be the start of something great that I just can’t foresee right now because I am scared shitless.

And if you can get curious about what scares or infuriates you, especially if it’s part of yourself, you can get way less scared.

I’d like to end with a story about the professor who inspired me to want to teach college. His name was Walt Mink, yes, they named a punk band after him. I got to know Walt because in the physiological psych class he taught I was paired with the most irritating lab partner in history.

Macalester College that year was awash in tie dye and long hair. This guy only wanted to talk about the superiority of white people over African Americans and Jews.

He had allergies, not the best hygiene. He smelled like a foot. And he wiped snot on a lot of stuff I had to pick up.

At one point I went to Walt, who I was sort of shy to talk to because I was an idiot. So at one point I go to my professor and I said, ‘Why don’t you just tell him to shut up?’

And Walt said a sentence I’ll never forget because it has informed my life as a professor: ‘Because it’s my job to put information into his head and unless I know what’s already in there, I can’t do my job.’

He had shown me how to replace revulsion with curiosity. To wonder. Because of that kid I wound up in Walt’s office a lot. And because I was depressed I eventually broke down crying, and he and his wife helped me get into therapy and they gave me all these easy jobs so I could pay for it, like taking care of the department’s lab rats and babysitting their high school-aged kids who didn’t need it.

So was that lab partner good for me or bad for me?

Also, Walt took me to lunch all the time, which then seemed like an incredible luxury to be able to eat in a restaurant. And before I left Minnesota I said to him, how will I ever pay you back for all this?

And he looked surprised. He said, ‘It’s not that linear. You’re not going to pay me back, you’re going to go out there and take somebody else to lunch.’

Now, the idea that Walt thought, looking at me at 19 years old, that I would ever make enough money to buy somebody else lunch, astonished me.

It is truly the greatest vote of confidence I’d ever received. Walt showed me that a talent for fear could also mask a talent for empathy.

For caring about what other people thought.

I hope you remember what Walt says when the world scares you with its barks and bites. May you leave us more curious and more openhearted about your fellow citizens than when you showed up.

Being smart and rich are lucky. But being curious and compassionate will save your ass.

Being curious and compassionate will take you out of your ego and edge your soul towards wonder, a word I inadvertently stole from Chancellor Syverud today.

Now ya’ll go out there and buy somebody broker than you lunch.

Thank you.”


Thank you President Fitts, the board of Tulane members and today’s honorary degree recipients.

Good morning graduates, families and friends of graduates — mothers, fathers, brothers, brothers from other mothers, sisters, roommates, “roommates,” grandmas, grandpas, Meemaws and Papaws, Bubbies, Nanas and Boppas, Nany Gigi’s and their special friend Herb, Aunt Ronnies, Uncle Garys and people who met on Tinder this morning.

I thank you for having me here to join you on this special day in this beautiful city. I stand here humbled, gracious and completely naked under this robe.

It really is a true honor to be with all of you as you begin this new phase of your life – as you embark on this exciting and challenging journey of being sober during the day.

I applaud you for being here today because it means not only have you earned a college degree but you have found this arena despite still having a blood alcohol level of 9.03999. I’m looking at you School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

From this day forward the world is filled with endless possibilities. You’re young, you’re in your twenties. This is a great day for all of you. Except for those of you leaving college with any student loan debt. I don’t know what to say to you. I’m sorry. I hope you win the lottery.

Back in January when the University asked me to make today’s commencement speech I was delighted. So when I started writing it this morning back at the hotel, the first thing I did was go online and look up other commencement speeches. And then I got tired, so I took a nap. I woke up, cried a little bit. Ordered some Huevos Rancheros from Room Service. Then I cried a little bit more. And then I picked myself up by the bootstraps and decided to go back to sleep. And after I hit that snooze button four or five times I got up again and I did what all of you probably did while you were pushing through finals week. I made sure all the apps on my phone were updated, because that felt like the most important thing. And then I checked Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. I Periscoped my breakfast, I took 4 quizzes on Buzzfeed and I watched Game of Thrones.

And as I finished writing the speech on the car ride over here this morning I thought about just how deep my Tulane roots are. I’m proud to say that my father, Richard Rudolph graduated class of 1968. And today my cousin Sabrina Rudolph is graduating with all of you. Sabrina, I’d like to embarrass you by asking you to please stand up and wave at everyone. I’m so proud of you. Now please don’t tarnish the family name.

Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon, Jay Z, LeBron James, Lucille Ball – these are all graduates of Tulane University according to my Phone. And they all graduated Magna Carta Holy Grail. Now I don’t speak Latin so I don’t know what that means, but I do speak Pig Latin… so I know how to say “I EAKSPAY IGPAY ATINLAY.”

I didn’t go to Tulane. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz which is a hippie school nestled in the seaside woods of Northern California. You have The Green Wave our school mascot was the Banana Slug. We didn’t have a Football team but we did have an Ultimate Frisbee Team. I majored in Not Washing My Feet and Advanced Zig Zag Rolling. For a lot of my 5-year college career, I was lost. Like, actually lost. Santa Cruz is mostly woods, you make one wrong turn and you’re gone for days.

I didn’t know who I was or what I was going to do with my life when I finished college. I wasn’t any clearer about my direction than the day I graduated high school. I wore Birkenstocks and smelled like a patchouli fart.

And I am only willing to admit that now that Birkenstocks are sold at Urban Outfitters.

And then during senior year my father asked me what I planned to do after I graduated. And I told him “I want to be on Saturday Night Live.”

But until that moment I never wanted to admit that being on SNL was my dream. I never wanted to admit that I was a Thespian. And this was back in the days when people weren’t really talking about being thespians. Before Thespians could marry.

My Dad did what any great teacher would do — he looked at me unfazed and said, “Great. And how do you plan to support yourself while you figure that out? And when are you going to wash your feet?” He was realistic, supportive, deflected the responsibility back to me and subtly showed his support for his daughters pursuit of a life in Fart Jokes.

So I did what many of you will probably do — I enrolled in more college and asked my Dad to pay for it.

At the Groundlings Theatre in Los Angeles, I studied Improvisation. And in Improvisation there is one hard and fast rule, and that rule is known as “Yes And”. The term YES AND: to say yes, and not just yes, but to add information. In the adding of information you don’t negate the other persons idea – but you build on it.

So like this: If I’m in a scene with you President Fitts and you say, “hey, you’re Oprah Winfrey.” And I say, “No I’m not.” Then our scene would be over. But if you say, “Hey, you’re Oprah Winfrey” and I say, “Yes I am…and today Class of 2015??? Look Under Your Seats! Because you are all leaving here today with a COLLEGE DIPLOMA!!! YOU GET A COLLEGE DIPLOMA! YOU GET A COLLEGE DIPLOMA!”


If I could give my 21 year old self any advice it would be take as many bikini photos as you can now because your body is smokin’ hot. And it will not be this bangin’ after childbirth.

But seriously, if I could give my 21 year old self the advice I’m giving you today and if I had a time machine, well first I would go back in time and invent the iPhone, cause I think I could make a ton of money.

So if I must give any of you advice it would be Say Yes. Say Yes, And… and create your own destiny.

So hold on to your old friends. Kiss your Mama. Admit what your dreams are. Don’t beat yourself up if you don’t know what you’re gonna do tomorrow. But work hard and don’t be lazy. And put away your damn phone once in a while. And be nice to jerks because we still don’t know the criteria for getting into heaven yet.

Now go make your parents proud and figure out how to end global warming. I love you Class of 2015. Now would you all please rise for the National Anthem.

Thank you for this honor. When I first arrived in the robing room I had to figure out who was the president and the chancellor, and they were the ones wearing the most bling. I was invited to give the commencement speech and they said I would have 8 minutes, I said the universe needs more than eight minutes. I need at least nine minutes. Maybe ten. I don't know.

I thought I would spend this time, brief as it is, together, things that you should know going forward in life. Maybe you already know it, but I don't think everybody knows all of this. Couple of things. Your grades. Whatever is your GPA rapidly becomes irrelevant in your life. I cannot begin to impress upon you how irrelevant it becomes. Ask anybody just a few years older than you "When was the last time someone asked about your GPA?" And they will have long forgotten, because in life they're not gonna ask you your GPA. They will ask you "are you a hard worker?" "Are you a problem solver?" "Are you committed?" "Are you a good leader?" All of these other questions matter in the rest of your life.

I remember taking the SATs long ago. I remember I got the scores back and my verbal score was ok, but it wasn't one of those scores where a teacher will say "hey he'll go far, watch that student!" So a few years go by, I get my masters, my PHD, I write a column for a magazine... 5 books later I get mai- mail used to come in paper envelopes. I got a letter from the educational testing service in New Jersey. They are the purveyors of the SATs. Just to show you what kind of grip these institutions have on us, I get the letter saying Gasp, concern was there an error in my SAT scores?! I'm a full grown adult reacting this way to a letter. And I open it up and they said dear DR Tyson, we were reading one of your essays on the universe, and we were impressed with it so much we want to use it for the next round of SATs for the reading comprehension part for the students. So I said "What ---- just happened here!? Something is wrong!"

If the exam means anything, if your GPA means anything, it's that you were in that moment and it sooo does not define you for the rest of your life.

Another thing- the most dangerous people in a free society are those who don't know- by the way it's ok to not know! This is what school is for! That's ok! But if you don't know, but think you do know, and have power over legislation that would affect others, THAT is dangerous. Those are the signs of the end of an informed democracy. Science matters. Other subjects matter too, but I'm just saying, science matters in the following way. Think about it. Cavemen and women: they had clean air, freshwater, their food was free range, organic, and their life expectancy was thirty five!

Something else that matters that improves your life expectancy than just the search for clean air and clean water! There's more going on in our lives, brought to you by innovations in science and technology, that improves your health, your wealth, your well-being, just consider that before you start saying "I don't like science, I don't want science" Then move the hell back into the cave and we'll go to your funeral before you turn 36!

Another thing- this is just a list, I'm going down a list- It's become a past-time to blame politicians for the ills of the world. And I understand the urge to do that, I get that, however, I understand the urge, but at the end of the day, the politician is a representative of an elector. I go to Washington but I don't beat the politicians over the head- they are duly elected officials!

If you have an issue with the politicians that means you have an issue with your fellow citizens that put them there! So if there is a politician that is SURE that the universe is 6,000 years old, It's because there are people walking among us that think that.

As an educator it is my duty to teach people about the methods and tools of science- how and why it works, because the engines of tomorrow's economy depends on it. Innovations in science and technology will drive the 21st century economies. The extent to which you cherry pick science for your own philosophy, just because you didn't like the result- where does it stop! What's gonna happen, you're gonna say "I want to repeal the law of gravity because I gained ten pounds last month!" Where does it stop!

The laws of physics affect us all! Objective truths are true whether or not you believe in them. So if you are not scientifically literate in the 21st century, you will have disenfranchised yourself from important decisions that affect us all. Unless you're ok with that, you should be thinking about how to learn- it doesn't mean you have to be a scientist, no you don't have to be one, just understand what it is, and why!

Scientific literacy is not how much you know, it's how your brain is wired for thought. If someone comes up to you and says "I have these crystals, and if you rub them together and dance under them, it'll cure your ailments." Ok so now, it's easy to be smug and say this person is a freaking idiot, let me just leave them alone.

One might also say "Wow that's great lemme get them, how much are they, I'll buy all of them!" Do you realize each of those states of mind are equally as lazy. It actually takes effort to inquire about the truth of something. Effort. So you ask "Where are these crystals from? What are they made of? What's their chemical composition? What are the properties you're evoking that claims to create the health? What're the experiments, can you cite them?"

That is science literacy. Neither the blunt acceptance or blunt rejection of a claim of someone who is making statements in the name of science. That's a point. Another point- this Is a personal thing- I think on some level role models are overrated. Ooooooo. Lemme tell you why. I'll tell you why.

Growing up in the Bronx-Bronx in the house, huh?- Had I acquired a prerequisite that another black man from the Bronx had become an astrophysicist, I'd still be in the Bronx. If you acquire a role model who looks just like you to be something you wanna be, and you can't find one, is that a reason to not be what you want to be? No!

My argument is simple. You could assemble your role model- get the people that do what you like, but you don't have to be them! Be the piece of them that you want to be, and if it's someone who was moral, do that, someone athletic, do that. You don't have to be the whole person. That protects you from when your person messes up in some fundamental way, there is not this fear that you have to mess up too, because that's what your role model did.

So I encourage people to assemble their role models ala carte. That is a far more potent way to establish what it is you want to become in this world Now a couple things just cosmically. The universe is bigger than you are. Lesson one. It sounds obvious, but some people don't really know that. Number two, Earth. If someone invites you to go to Mars, just remember how beautiful Earth is before you do that. You can breathe the air, you know, things like this, however. Do not forget that Earth is really good at killing Over ninety seven percent of all the species of life on earth that have ever existed are now extinct because of Earth. So we think of Earth as a haven, but in fact it is out to kill us every opportunity it gets. It's our ingenuity in spite of that fact that prevents it. And the sun, is a limitless source of energy. Oil under the ground, not so much. If you want us to exist and thrive into the future, and you're one of these people that say "I don't need space, I'll solve all my problems here on earth" meanwhile there's unlimited energy, unlimited resources, move back to the cave because that's where you'll be when this is all over.

My final point. We live in a world where not everyone has the urge to help others. Ok? Wanna do it all yourself for yourself, and require that other people help themselves, and I'm reminded of a saying that went around for awhile they say "We need people to lift themselves up by their bootstraps". And then I think about that, and that works you know, sometimes, but we're reminded that –ok I'm gonna tweet this just because uh, yeah, I'm feeling it.... Excuse me. Ok it'll just take a second... It is ok to encourage others to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. But if you do just remember that some people have no boots. Thank you.

Good morning. Oh, what a day. What a lovely day. It’s a pleasure to be addressing the Wake Forest graduating Class of 2015. I want to start by thanking the administration and the Trustees for inviting me to speak. I want to thank them for giving me an honorary Doctorate of Humanities. I’m a huge fan of humans. And I have to thank them for this thing around my neck. There’s nothing you want on a chilly day like today than a nice scarf.I especially want to thank the University president, Nathan O. Hatch, known to you as Nate Dawg, Natty O, the Hatchet, Hatch Adam, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Angel Dust. And I only made a couple of those up.

Of course, we mustn’t forget the parents, who, to get you students to this day, have sacrificed so many things, primarily money. I’m sure there are other things they’ve sacrificed, but I’m gonna guess that money’s the one they bring up most often.

Most importantly, congratulations to you, the Class of 2015. You did it.

And you look amazing. Although it’s a little embarrassing you all showed up in the same outfit. Really. Even all the accessories are the same. Everyone has a black and gold tassel. Or, is it blue and white? Grandparents, just know this was the issue that divided a generation. You had the Vietnam War. Your grandchildren had an ambiguously colored Tumblr post.

I am so proud to be your Commencement speaker today, cause I know I am following in some impressive footsteps. Last year, you heard from New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson, who, unfortunately, lost her job just five days before her speech. Is there something you know about my new job that I don’t? Please. Just tell me. I really need that money. I have kids in college.

Of course for you grads, the future is a dark chasm of yawning uncertainty. But don’t worry. You don’t have to face the future for like two hours — first brunch then yawning uncertainty. But for now, you are still nestled in the beautiful, comforting bosom of Wake Forest.

There’s an interesting story about how this institution came to be. The father of Wake Forest, Samuel Wait, was trying to raise money for a different school, but during his travels his horse ran off, and he became stranded nearby. So the locals asked him to lead their new university. It was a simpler time. Back then, they just handed out universities to whoever’s horse had run off most recently. This man has no control over his animals? Surely, he has something to teach us all.Of course, Wake Forest or Wack Fo as I’ve been asked by Provost Kersh not to call it, wasn’t always the purely academic institution it is today. It was founded as the seductively named Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute. And students spent half their day toiling in the fields. The first class had just 16 students, one of them just 12 years old. But, he was a prodigy. He could haul sacks of grain at a college level.

Back then, of course, if you didn’t get into the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, you could always settle for the North Carolina Crushing Toil Academy, which now, of course, is known as UNC.

Wake Forest has always been a leader. In the late 19th century, this was among the first Southern schools to teach biology in a lab. Before then, you weren’t supposed to learn biology until marriage.In 1962, Wake Forest had the proud distinction of being the South’s first major private school to integrate. And, yes…they’ve kept it up. All right. Good. Good. You don’t know these days. You don’t know.

Even now, Wake Forest is a trailblazer. You were America’s first top 30 school to make standardized testing optional. The implications are huge. Consider this: In a group of 30 applicants, where 15 took the SATs, 10 took the ACTs and five took no test, calculate the ratio between…actually, forget it. You all didn’t have to know any of that stuff.

Still, while Wake has been a trailblazer, this is a school that respects tradition. Traditions like rolling the Quad with toilet paper after big wins. And this is actually an eco-friendly tradition because, looking at this season’s win-loss record, you guys saved a lot of paper.Let me win you back. Duke sucks.

I do want to say one thing that I love about rolling the Quad. It really sticks it to the trees. I mean, covering a tree with the processed pulp of its relatives? That sends a harsh message. That’s like throwing wallets at an alligator or flinging piano keys at an elephant.

Speaking of the Quad. Streaking. Is anyone here naked under their robes? No? Just me. Ok. You are the rare school that not only streaks your Quad; you also have a 24-hour live webcam pointed at it. Come on. Naked on a webcam, really? You young people know that’s wrong. Those are the kind of pictures you’re supposed to Snapchat to each other.
You people also have campus traditions that are people. I want to give a shout out to Mr. Dean Shore, the University barber. There he is. Right there. Dean actually contacted me first by sending me a Facebook request the minute my plane landed. He is a friend to so many students, and a real throwback to a simpler time because when your biggest local celebrity is a barber, you’re basically a medieval village.

But of all the local celebrities, none is more famous than your mascot, the Demon Deacon. Everybody loves the Deacon. When he rides out on his motorcycle during basketball games, the crowd erupts with a madness that can come only from the passion of true fans or from inhaling motorcycle fumes in an enclosed space.Clearly, Wake Forest has come a long way since it was a labor school founded by a horseless drifter. But as great as Wake Forest is, Wake is your past now. It is my responsibility as a commencement speaker to prepare you for what awaits you in the future.

Here it is: No one has any idea what’s going to happen. Not even Elon Musk. That’s why he’s building those rockets. He wants a ‘Plan B’ on another world.

But whatever happens, I think it’s entirely appropriate that I’m the one talking to you right now. Because I just spent many years learning to do one thing really well. I got so comfortable with that place, that role, those responsibilities that it came to define how I saw myself. But now that part of my life is over. It’s time to say goodbye to the person we’ve become, we’ve worked so hard to perfect, and to make some crucial decisions about who we’re going to be. For me, I’ll have to figure out how to do an hour-long show every night. And you, at some point, will have to sleep. I am told the Adderall wears off eventually. Good luck.But this uncertainty is not new to your generation. The future is always uncertain. The only thing we can be sure will happen in 2016 is that we’ll elect a new president. And that between now and then, about this many people will run as the Republican nominee.

Yes, you are graduating into an election year, which is the technical term for “two years before an election.” A lot of candidates will be vying for your attention, and you will perform the ultimate civic duty: deciding for whom you will swipe left and for whom you will swipe right. Because I think we’re voting on Tinder now. At least the Republicans are. Democrats might be voting on Grindr. I don’t know.And with all these people appealing to you, you’re going to have to learn pretty damn quick how to tell the difference between hype and substance. So to keep folks from selling you things and ideas that aren’t true, you will need a well calibrated BS detector. And luckily, I’m selling them today for the low, low price of just $89.95. Order now and I’ll include an anti-flim-flam travel case. That’s Stephen Colbert’s BS detector. If you buy it, that means you needed it.

And if there’s one thing you need even more, it’s your own set of standards. It may seem counterintuitive now, but once you leave here, you may miss being graded on all your work. Because when you’re out of school, there are no objective criteria for achievement anymore.People my age will sometimes say to you, “Hey, that work you did, that thing you said, that cause you championed, it’s not good.” Well, having your own standards will help you weather moments like that. Having your own standards allows you to perceive success where others may see failure.

I’m reminded of one famous inventor who was ridiculed for his dream. But flash forward 15 years to the day. And do we or do we not now all ride Segways to work? We do not, but they are featured prominently in the movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop. That’s good, too.

Here’s another example. Over the years, I have given my work a lot of thought. I have my own standard for success now. I have a pretty good idea of what jokes will get laughs and a pretty good idea of what jokes may be iffy. But I’m going to say them anyway because I kind of like how iffy they are. Those who have watched my show over the years know I have made that decision many times. But having my own standards is why I could keep going at times when no one laughed or when I thought the person I was interviewing might throw a punch at me. It’s also why the epitaph on my tombstone will probably read, “Well, I thought it was funny.”Of course, any standards worth having will be a challenge to meet. And most of the time, you will fall short. But what is nice about having your own set of standards is that from now on, you fill out your own report card. So do yourself a favor: Be an easy grader. Score yourself on a curve. Give yourself extra credit. You have the power. You are your own professor now. Which I know is a little creepy because that means you’re showering with your professor. But you have tenure. They can’t fire you.

So I hope you find the courage to decide for yourself what is right and what is wrong. And then, please expect as much of the world around you. Try to make the world good according to your standards. It won’t be easy. Get ready for my generation to tell you everything that can’t be done — like ending racial tension, or getting money out of politics, or lowering the world’s carbon emissions. And we should know they can’t be done. After all, we’re the ones who didn’t do them.Your job, Pro Humanitate, is to prove us wrong. Because if you don’t prove us wrong, then forget everything I’ve been saying.

And instead, I’d like to leave you with a bit of wisdom I picked up from a documentary I saw this weekend: Mad Max: Fury Road. All you young people really need to succeed in the future is a reliable source of fuel and a fanatical cadre of psychopathic motorcycle killers. May you ride eternal, shiny and chrome.

Thank you for the honor of addressing you. And congratulations again to the Wake Forest Class of 2015.
